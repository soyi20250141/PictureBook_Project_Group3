chapter 1 two girls  rose sat all alone in the big best parlor with her little handkerchief laid ready to catch the first tear for she was thinking of her troubles and a shower was expected she had retired to this room as a good place in which to be miserable for it was dark and still full of ancient furniture sombre curtains and hung all around with portraits of solemn old gentlemen in wigs severenosed ladies in topheavy caps and staring children in little bobtailed coats or shortwaisted frocks it was an excellent place for woe and the fitful spring rain that pattered on the windowpane seemed to sob cry away  im with you  rose really did have some cause to be sad for she had no mother and had lately lost her father also which left her no home but this with her greataunts she had been with them only a week and though the dear old ladies had tried their best to make her happy they had not succeeded very well for she was unlike any child they had ever seen and they felt very much as if they had the care of a lowspirited butterfly  they had given her the freedom of the house and for a day or two she had amused herself roaming all over it for it was a capital old mansion and was full of all manner of odd nooks charming rooms and mysterious passages windows broke out in unexpected places little balconies overhung the garden most romantically and there was a long upper hall full of curiosities from all parts of the world for the campbells had been seacaptains for generations  aunt plenty had even allowed rose to rummage in her great china closet a spicy retreat rich in all the goodies that children love but rose seemed to care little for these toothsome temptations and when that hope failed aunt plenty gave up in despair  gentle aunt peace had tried all sorts of pretty needlework and planned a dolls wardrobe that would have won the heart of even an older child but rose took little interest in pink satin hats and tiny hose though she sewed dutifully till her aunt caught her wiping tears away with the train of a weddingdress and that discovery put an end to the sewing society  then both old ladies put their heads together and picked out the model child of the neighbourhood to come and play with their niece but ariadne blish was the worst failure of all for rose could not bear the sight of her and said she was so like a wax doll she longed to give her a pinch and see if she would squeak so prim little ariadne was sent home and the exhausted aunties left rose to her own devices for a day or two  bad weather and a cold kept her indoors and she spent most of her time in the library where her fathers books were stored here she read a great deal cried a little and dreamed many of the innocent bright dreams in which imaginative children find such comfort and delight this suited her better than anything else but it was not good for her and she grew pale heavyeyed and listless though aunt plenty gave her iron enough to make a cookingstove and aunt peace petted her like a poodle  seeing this the poor aunties racked their brains for a new amusement and determined to venture a bold stroke though not very hopeful of its success they said nothing to rose about their plan for this saturday afternoon but let her alone till the time came for the grand surprise little dreaming that the odd child would find pleasure for herself in a most unexpected quarter  before she had time to squeeze out a single tear a sound broke the stillness making her prick up her ears it was only the soft twitter of a bird but it seemed to be a peculiarly gifted bird for while she listened the soft twitter changed to a lively whistle then a trill a coo a chirp and ended in a musical mixture of all the notes as if the bird burst out laughing rose laughed also and forgetting her woes jumped up saying eagerly  it is a mockingbird where is it  running down the long hall she peeped out at both doors but saw nothing feathered except a draggletailed chicken under a burdock leaf she listened again and the sound seemed to be in the house away she went much excited by the chase and following the changeful song it led her to the chinacloset door  in there how funny she said but when she entered not a bird appeared except the everlastingly kissing swallows on the canton china that lined the shelves all of a sudden roses face brightened and softly opening the slide she peered into the kitchen but the music had stopped and all she saw was a girl in a blue apron scrubbing the hearth rose stared about her for a minute and then asked abruptly  did you hear that mockingbird  i should call it a phebebird answered the girl looking up with a twinkle in her black eyes  where did it go  it is here still  where  in my throat do you want to hear it  oh yes ill come in and rose crept through the slide to the wide shelf on the other side being too hurried and puzzled to go round by the door  the girl wiped her hands crossed her feet on the little island of carpet where she was stranded in a sea of soapsuds and then sure enough out of her slender throat came the swallows twitter the robins whistle the bluejays call the thrushs song the wooddoves coo and many another familiar note all ending as before with the musical ecstacy of a bobolink singing and swinging among the meadow grass on a bright june day  rose was so astonished that she nearly fell off her perch and when the little concert was over clapped her hands delightedly  oh it was lovely who taught you  the birds answered the girl with a smile as she fell to work again  it is very wonderful i can sing but nothing half so fine as that what is your name please  phebe moore  ive heard of phebebirds but i dont believe the real ones could do that laughed rose adding as she watched with interest the scattering of dabs of soft soap over the bricks may i stay and see you work it is very lonely in the parlor  yes indeed if you want to answered phebe wringing out her cloth in a capable sort of way that impressed rose very much  it must be fun to swash the water round and dig out the soap id love to do it only aunt wouldnt like it i suppose said rose quite taken with the new employment  youd soon get tired so youd better keep tidy and look on  i suppose you help your mother a good deal  i havent got any folks  why where do you live then  im going to live here i hope debby wants some one to help round and ive come to try for a week  i hope you will stay for it is very dull said rose who had taken a sudden fancy to this girl who sung like a bird and worked like a woman  hope i shall for im fifteen now and old enough to earn my own living you have come to stay a spell havent you asked phebe looking up at her guest and wondering how life could be dull to a girl who wore a silk frock a daintily frilled apron a pretty locket and had her hair tied up with a velvet snood  yes i shall stay till my uncle comes he is my guardian now and i dont know what he will do with me have you a guardian  my sakes no i was left on the poorhouse steps a little mite of a baby and miss rogers took a liking to me so ive been there ever since but she is dead now and i take care of myself  how interesting it is like arabella montgomery in the gypsys child did you ever read that sweet story asked rose who was fond of tales of foundlings and had read many  i dont have any books to read and all the spare time i get i run off into the woods that rests me better than stories answered phebe as she finished one job and began on another  rose watched her as she got out a great pan of beans to look over and wondered how it would seem to have life all work and no play presently phebe seemed to think it was her turn to ask questions and said wistfully  youve had lots of schooling i suppose  oh dear me yes ive been at boarding school nearly a year and im almost dead with lessons the more i got the more miss power gave me and i was so miserable that i most cried my eyes out papa never gave me hard things to do and he always taught me so pleasantly i loved to study oh we were so happy and so fond of one another but now he is gone and i am left all alone  the tear that would not come when rose sat waiting for it came now of its own accord two of them in fact and rolled down her cheeks telling the tale of love and sorrow better than any words could do it  for a minute there was no sound in the kitchen but the little daughters sobbing and the sympathetic patter of the rain phebe stopped rattling her beans from one pan to another and her eyes were full of pity as they rested on the curly head bent down on roses knee for she saw that the heart under the pretty locket ached with its loss and the dainty apron was used to dry sadder tears than any she had ever shed  somehow she felt more contented with her brown calico gown and bluechecked pinafore envy changed to compassion and if she had dared she would have gone and hugged her afflicted guest  fearing that might not be considered proper she said in her cheery voice  im sure you aint all alone with such a lot of folks belonging to you and all so rich and clever youll be petted to pieces debby says because you are the only girl in the family  phebes last words made rose smile in spite of her tears and she looked out from behind her apron with an april face saying in a tone of comic distress  thats one of my troubles ive got six aunts and they all want me and i dont know any of them very well papa named this place the aunthill and now i see why  phebe laughed with her as she said encouragingly  everyone calls it so and its a real good name for all the mrs campbells live handy by and keep coming up to see the old ladies  i could stand the aunts but there are dozens of cousins dreadful boys all of them and i detest boys some of them came to see me last wednesday but i was lying down and when auntie came to call me i went under the quilt and pretended to be asleep i shall have to see them some time but i do dread it so and rose gave a shudder for having lived alone with her invalid father she knew nothing of boys and considered them a species of wild animal  oh i guess youll like em ive seen em flying round when they come over from the point sometimes in their boats and sometimes on horseback if you like boats and horses youll enjoy yourself firstrate  but i dont im afraid of horses and boats make me ill and i hate boys and poor rose wrung her hands at the awful prospect before her one of these horrors alone she could have borne but all together were too much for her and she began to think of a speedy return to the detested school  phebe laughed at her woe till the beans danced in the pan but tried to comfort her by suggesting a means of relief  perhaps your uncle will take you away where there aint any boys debby says he is a real kind man and always bring heaps of nice things when he comes  yes but you see that is another trouble for i dont know uncle alec at all he hardly ever came to see us though he sent me pretty things very often now i belong to him and shall have to mind him till i am eighteen i may not like him a bit and i fret about it all the time  well i wouldnt borrow trouble but have a real good time im sure i should think i was in clover if i had folks and money and nothing to do but enjoy myself began phebe but got no further for a sudden rush and tumble outside made them both jump  its thunder said phebe  its a circus cried rose who from her elevated perch had caught glimpses of a gay cart of some sort and several ponies with flying manes and tails  the sound died away and the girls were about to continue their confidences when old debby appeared looking rather cross and sleepy after her nap  you are wanted in the parlor miss rose  has anybody come  little girls shouldnt ask questions but do as they are bid was all debby would answer  i do hope it isnt aunt myra she always scares me out of my wits asking how my cough is and groaning over me as if i was going to die  said rose preparing to retire the way she came for the slide being cut for the admission of bouncing christmas turkeys and puddings was plenty large enough for a slender girl  guess youll wish it was aunt myra when you see who has come dont never let me catch you coming into my kitchen that way again or ill shut you up in the big biler growled debby who thought it her duty to snub children on all occasions    chapter 2 the clan  rose scrambled into the chinacloset as rapidly as possible and there refreshed herself by making faces at debby while she settled her plumage and screwed up her courage then she crept softly down the hall and peeped into the parlor no one appeared and all was so still she felt sure the company was upstairs so she skipped boldly through the halfopen foldingdoors to behold on the other side a sight that nearly took her breath away  seven boys stood in a row all ages all sizes all yellowhaired and blueeyed all in full scotch costume and all smiling nodding and saying as with one voice how are you cousin  rose gave a little gasp and looked wildly about her as if ready to fly for fear magnified the seven and the room seemed full of boys before she could run however the tallest lad stepped out of the line saying pleasantly  dont be frightened this is the clan come to welcome you and im the chief archie at your service  he held out his hand as he spoke and rose timidly put her own into a brown paw which closed over the white morsel and held it as the chief continued his introductions  we came in full rig for we always turn out in style on grand occasions hope you like it now ill tell you who these chaps are and then we shall be all right this big one is prince charlie aunt claras boy she has but one so he is an extra good one this old fellow is mac the bookworm called worm for short this sweet creature is steve the dandy look at his gloves and topknot if you please they are aunt janes lads and a precious pair youd better believe these are the brats my brothers geordie and will and jamie the baby now my men step out and show your manners  at this command to roses great dismay six more hands were offered and it was evident that she was expected to shake them all it was a trying moment to the bashful child but remembering that they were her kinsmen come to welcome her she tried her best to return the greeting cordially  this impressive ceremony being over the clan broke ranks and both rooms instantly appeared to be pervaded with boys rose hastily retired to the shelter of a big chair and sat there watching the invaders and wondering when her aunt would come and rescue her  as if bound to do their duty manfully yet rather oppressed by it each lad paused beside her chair in his wanderings made a brief remark received a still briefer answer and then sheered off with a relieved expression  archie came first and leaning over the chairback observed in a paternal tone  im glad youve come cousin and i hope youll find the aunthill pretty jolly  i think i shall  mac shook his hair out of his eyes stumbled over a stool and asked abruptly  did you bring any books with you  four boxes full they are in the library  mac vanished from the room and steve striking an attitude which displayed his costume effectively said with an affable smile  we were sorry not to see you last wednesday i hope your cold is better  yes thank you and a smile began to dimple about roses mouth as she remembered her retreat under the bedcover  feeling that he had been received with distinguished marks of attention steve strolled away with his topknot higher than ever and prince charlie pranced across the room saying in a free and easy tone  mamma sent her love and hopes you will be well enough to come over for a day next week it must be desperately dull here for a little thing like you  im thirteen and a half though i do look small cried rose forgetting her shyness in indignation at this insult to her newly acquired teens  beg pardon maam never should have guessed it and charlie went off with a laugh glad to have struck a spark out of his meek cousin  geordie and will came together two sturdy eleven and twelve year olders and fixing their round blue eyes on rose fired off a question apiece as if it was a shooting match and she the target  did you bring your monkey  no he is dead  are you going to have a boat  i hope not  here the two with a rightaboutface movement abruptly marched away and little jamie demanded with childish frankness  did you bring me anything nice  yes lots of candy answered rose whereupon jamie ascended into her lap with a sounding kiss and the announcement that he liked her very much  this proceeding rather startled rose for the other lads looked and laughed and in her confusion she said hastily to the young usurper  did you see the circus go by  when where cried all the boys in great excitement at once  just before you came at least i thought it was a circus for i saw a red and black sort of cart and ever so many little ponies and   she got no farther for a general shout made her pause suddenly as archie explained the joke by saying in the middle of his laugh  it was our new dogcart and the shetland ponies youll never hear the last of your circus cousin  but there were so many and they went so fast and the cart was so very red began rose trying to explain her mistake  come and see them all cried the prince and before she knew what was happening she was borne away to the barn and tumultuously introduced to three shaggy ponies and the gay new dogcart  she had never visited these regions before and had her doubts as to the propriety of her being there now but when she suggested that auntie might not like it there was a general cry of  she told us to amuse you and we can do it ever so much better out here than poking round in the house  im afraid i shall get cold without my sacque began rose who wanted to stay but felt rather out of her element  no you wont well fix you cried the lads as one clapped his cap on her head another tied a rough jacket round her neck by the sleeves a third neatly smothered her in a carriage blanket and a fourth threw open the door of the old barouche that stood there saying with a flourish  step in maam and make yourself comfortable while we show you some fun  so rose sat in state enjoying herself very much for the lads proceeded to dance a highland fling with a spirit and skill that made her clap her hands and laugh as she had not done for weeks  how is that my lassie asked the prince coming up all flushed and breathless when the ballet was over  it was splendid i never went to the theatre but once and the dancing was not half so pretty as this what clever boys you must be said rose smiling upon her kinsmen like a little queen upon her subjects  ah were a fine lot and that is only the beginning of our larks we havent got the pipes here or wed      sing for you play for you      a dulcy melody  answered charlie looking much elated at her praise  i did not know we were scotch papa never said anything about it or seemed to care about scotland except to have me sing the old ballads  said rose beginning to feel as if she had left america behind her somewhere  neither did we till lately weve been reading scotts novels and all of a sudden we remembered that our grandfather was a scotchman so we hunted up the old stories got a bagpipe put on our plaids and went in heart and soul for the glory of the clan weve been at it some time now and its great fun our people like it and i think we are a pretty canny set  archie said this from the other coachstep where he had perched while the rest climbed up before and behind to join in the chat as they rested  im fitzjames and hes roderick dhu and well give you the broadsword combat some day its a great thing youd better believe added the prince  yes and you should hear steve play the pipes he makes em skirl like a good one cried will from the box eager to air the accomplishments of his race  macs the fellow to hunt up the old stories and tell us how to dress right and pick out rousing bits for us to speak and sing put in geordie saying a good word for the absent worm  and what do you and will do asked rose of jamie who sat beside her as if bound to keep her in sight till the promised gift had been handed over  oh im the little footpage and do errands and will and geordie are the troops when we march and the stags when we hunt and the traitors when we want to cut any heads off  they are very obliging im sure said rose whereat the utility men  beamed with modest pride and resolved to enact wallace and montrose as soon as possible for their cousins special benefit  lets have a game of tag cried the prince swinging himself up to a beam with a sounding slap on stevies shoulder  regardless of his gloves dandy tore after him and the rest swarmed in every direction as if bent on breaking their necks and dislocating their joints as rapidly as possible  it was a new and astonishing spectacle to rose fresh from a prim boardingschool and she watched the active lads with breathless interest thinking their antics far superior to those of mops the dear departed monkey  will had just covered himself with glory by pitching off a high loft head first and coming up all right when phebe appeared with a cloak hood and rubbers also a message from aunt plenty that miss rose was to come in directly  all right well bring her answered archie issuing some mysterious order which was so promptly obeyed that before rose could get out of the carriage the boys had caught hold of the pole and rattled her out of the barn round the oval and up to the front door with a cheer that brought two caps to an upper window and caused debby to cry aloud from the back porch  them harumscarum boys will certainly be the death of that delicate little creter  but the delicate little creter seemed all the better for her trip and ran up the steps looking rosy gay and dishevelled to be received with lamentation by aunt plenty who begged her to go and lie down at once  oh please dont we have come to tea with our cousin and well be as good as gold if youll let us stay auntie clamoured the boys who not only approved of our cousin but had no mind to lose their tea for aunt plentys name but feebly expressed her bountiful nature  well dears you can only be quiet and let rose go and take her iron and be made tidy and then we will see what we can find for supper  said the old lady as she trotted away followed by a volley of directions for the approaching feast  marmalade for me auntie  plenty of plumcake please  tell debby to trot out the baked pears  im your man for lemonpie maam  do have fritters rose will like em  shed rather have tarts i know  when rose came down fifteen minutes later with every curl smoothed and her most beruffled apron on she found the boys loafing about the long hall and paused on the halfway landing to take an observation for till now she had not really examined her newfound cousins  there was a strong family resemblance among them though some of the yellow heads were darker than others some of the cheeks brown instead of rosy and the ages varied all the way from sixteenyearold archie to jamie who was ten years younger none of them were especially comely but the prince yet all were hearty happylooking lads and rose decided that boys were not as dreadful as she had expected to find them  they were all so characteristically employed that she could not help smiling as she looked archie and charlie evidently great cronies were pacing up and down shoulder to shoulder whistling bonnie dundee mac was reading in a corner with his book close to his nearsighted eyes dandy was arranging his hair before the oval glass in the hatstand geordie and will investigating the internal economy of the moonfaced clock and jamie lay kicking up his heels on the mat at the foot of the stairs bent on demanding his sweeties the instant rose appeared  she guessed his intention and forestalled his demand by dropping a handful of sugarplums down upon him  at his cry of rapture the other lads looked up and smiled involuntarily for the little kinswoman standing there above was a winsome sight with her shy soft eyes bright hair and laughing face the black frock reminded them of her loss and filled the boyish hearts with a kindly desire to be good to our cousin who had no longer any home but this  there she is as fine as you please cried steve kissing his hand to her  come on missy tea is ready added the prince encouragingly  i shall take her in and archie offered his arm with great dignity an honour that made rose turn as red as a cherry and long to run upstairs again  it was a merry supper and the two elder boys added much to the fun by tormenting the rest with dark hints of some interesting event which was about to occur something uncommonly fine they declared it was but enveloped in the deepest mystery for the present  did i ever see it asked jamie  not to remember it but mac and steve have and liked it immensely  answered archie thereby causing the two mentioned to neglect debbys delectable fritters for several minutes while they cudgelled their brains  who will have it first asked will with his mouth full of marmalade  aunt plenty i guess  when will she have it demanded geordie bouncing in his seat with impatience  sometime on monday  heart alive what is the boy talking about cried the old lady from behind the tall urn which left little to be seen but the topmost bow of her cap  doesnt auntie know asked a chorus of voices  no and thats the best of the joke for she is desperately fond of it  what colour is it asked rose joining in the fun  blue and brown  is it good to eat asked jamie  some people think so but i shouldnt like to try it answered charlie laughing so he split his tea  who does it belong to put in steve  archie and the prince stared at one another rather blankly for a minute then archie answered with a twinkle of the eye that made charlie explode again  to grandfather campbell  this was a poser and they gave up the puzzle though jamie confided to rose that he did not think he could live till monday without knowing what this remarkable thing was  soon after tea the clan departed singing all the blue bonnets are over the border at the tops of their voices  well dear how do you like your cousins asked aunt plenty as the last pony frisked round the corner and the din died away  pretty well maam but i like phebe better an answer which caused aunt plenty to hold up her hands in despair and trot away to tell sister peace that she never should understand that child and it was a mercy alec was coming soon to take the responsibility off their hands  fatigued by the unusual exertions of the afternoon rose curled herself up in the sofa corner to rest and think about the great mystery little guessing that she was to know it first of all  right in the middle of her meditations she fell asleep and dreamed she was at home again in her own little bed she seemed to wake and see her father bending over her to hear him say my little rose to answer yes papa and then to feel him take her in his arms and kiss her tenderly so sweet so real was the dream that she started up with a cry of joy to find herself in the arms of a brown bearded man who held her close and whispered in a voice so like her fathers that she clung to him involuntarily  this is my little girl and i am uncle alec    chapter 3 uncles  when rose woke next morning she was not sure whether she had dreamed what occurred the night before or it had actually happened so she hopped up and dressed although it was an hour earlier than she usually rose for she could not sleep any more being possessed with a strong desire to slip down and see if the big portmanteau and packing cases were really in the hall she seemed to remember tumbling over them when she went to bed for the aunts had sent her off very punctually because they wanted their pet nephew all to themselves  the sun was shining and rose opened her window to let in the soft may air fresh from the sea as she leaned over her little balcony watching an early bird get the worm and wondering how she should like uncle alec she saw a man leap the garden wall and come whistling up the path at first she thought it was some trespasser but a second look showed her that it was her uncle returning from an early dip into the sea she had hardly dared to look at him the night before because whenever she tried to do so she always found a pair of keen blue eyes looking at her now she could take a good stare at him as he lingered along looking about him as if glad to see the old place again  a brown breezy man in a blue jacket with no hat on the curly head which he shook now and then like a water dog broadshouldered alert in his motions and with a general air of strength and stability about him which pleased rose though she could not explain the feeling of comfort it gave her she had just said to herself with a sense of relief i guess i shall like him though he looks as if he made people mind when he lifted his eyes to examine the budding horsechestnut overhead and saw the eager face peering down at him he waved his hand to her nodded and called out in a bluff cheery voice  you are on deck early little niece  i got up to see if you had really come uncle  did you well come down here and make sure of it  im not allowed to go out before breakfast sir  oh indeed with a shrug then ill come aboard and salute he added and to roses great amazement uncle alec went up one of the pillars of the back piazza hand over hand stepped across the roof and swung himself into her balcony saying as he landed on the wide balustrade  have you any doubts about me now maam  rose was so taken aback she could only answer with a smile as she went to meet him  how does my girl do this morning he asked taking the little cold hand she gave him in both his big warm ones  pretty well thank you sir  ah but it should be very well why isnt it  i always wake up with a headache and feel tired  dont you sleep well  i lie awake a long time and then i dream and my sleep does not seem to rest me much  what do you do all day  oh i read and sew a little and take naps and sit with auntie  no running about out of doors or housework or riding hey  aunt plenty says im not strong enough for much exercise i drive out with her sometimes but i dont care for it  im not surprised at that said uncle alec half to himself adding in his quick way  who have you had to play with  no one but ariadne blish and she was such a goose i couldnt bear her the boys came yesterday and seemed rather nice but of course i couldnt play with them  why not  im too old to play with boys  not a bit of it thats just what you need for youve been mollycoddled too much they are good lads and youll be mixed up with them more or less for years to come so you may as well be friends and playmates at once i will look you up some girls also if i can find a sensible one who is not spoilt by her nonsensical education  phebe is sensible im sure and i like her though i only saw her yesterday cried rose waking up suddenly  and who is phebe if you please  rose eagerly told all she knew and uncle alec listened with an odd smile lurking about his mouth though his eyes were quite sober as he watched the face before him  im glad to see that you are not aristocratic in your tastes but i dont quite make out why you like this young lady from the poorhouse  you may laugh at me but i do i cant tell why only she seems so happy and busy and sings so beautifully and is strong enough to scrub and sweep and hasnt any troubles to plague her said rose making a funny jumble of reasons in her efforts to explain  how do you know that  oh i was telling her about mine and asked if she had any and she said no only id like to go to school and i mean to some day  so she doesnt call desertion poverty and hard work troubles shes a brave little girl and i shall be proud to know her and uncle alec gave an approving nod that made rose wish she had been the one to earn it  but what are these troubles of yours child he asked after a minute of silence  please dont ask me uncle  cant you tell them to me as well as to phebe  something in his tone made rose feel that it would be better to speak out and be done with it so she answered with sudden colour and averted eyes  the greatest one was losing dear papa  as she said that uncle alecs arm came gently round her and he drew her to him saying in the voice so like papas  that is a trouble which i cannot cure my child but i shall try to make you feel it less what else dear  i am so tired and poorly all the time i cant do anything i want to and it makes me cross sighed rose rubbing the aching head like a fretful child  that we can cure and we will said her uncle with a decided nod that made the curls bob on his head to that rose saw the gray ones underneath the brown  aunt myra says i have no constitution and never shall be strong  observed rose in a pensive tone as if it was rather a nice thing to be an invalid  aunt myra is a ahem an excellent woman but it is her hobby to believe that everyone is tottering on the brink of the grave and upon my life i believe she is offended if people dont fall into it we will show her how to make constitutions and turn palefaced little ghosts into rosy hearty girls thats my business you know he added more quietly for his sudden outburst had rather startled rose  i had forgotten you were a doctor im glad of it for i do want to be well only i hope you wont give me much medicine for ive taken quarts already and it does me no good  as she spoke rose pointed to a little table just inside the window on which appeared a regiment of bottles  ah ha now well see what mischief these blessed women have been at  and making a long arm dr alec set the bottles on the wide railing before him examined each carefully smiled over some frowned over others and said as he put down the last  now ill show you the best way to take these messes and as quick as a flash he sent one after another smashing down into the posybeds below  but aunt plenty wont like it and aunt myra will be angry for she sent most of them cried rose half frightened and half pleased at such energetic measures  you are my patient now and ill take the responsibility my way of giving physic is evidently the best for you look better already he said laughing so infectiously that rose followed suit saying saucily  if i dont like your medicines any better than those i shall throw them into the garden and then what will you do  when i prescribe such rubbish ill give you leave to pitch it overboard as soon as you like now what is the next trouble  i hoped you would forget to ask  but how can i help you if i dont know them come let us have no 3  it is very wrong i suppose but i do sometimes wish i had not quite so many aunts they are all very good to me and i want to please them but they are so different i feel sort of pulled to pieces among them said rose trying to express the emotions of a stray chicken with six hens all clucking over it at once  uncle alec threw back his head and laughed like a boy for he could entirely understand how the good ladies had each put in her oar and tried to paddle her own way to the great disturbance of the waters and the entire bewilderment of poor rose  i intend to try a course of uncles now and see how that suits your constitution im going to have you all to myself and no one is to give a word of advice unless i ask it there is no other way to keep order aboard and i am captain of this little craft for a time at least what comes next  but rose stuck there and grew so red her uncle guessed what that trouble was  i dont think i can tell this one it wouldnt be polite and i feel pretty sure that it isnt going to be a trouble any more  as she blushed and stammered over these words dr alec turned his eyes away to the distant sea and said so seriously so tenderly that she felt every word and long remembered them  my child i dont expect you to love and trust me all at once but i do want you to believe that i shall give my whole heart to this new duty and if i make mistakes as i probably shall no one will grieve over them more bitterly than i it is my fault that i am a stranger to you when i want to be your best friend that is one of my mistakes and i never repented it more deeply than i do now your father and i had a trouble once and i thought i could never forgive him so i kept away for years thank god we made it all up the last time i saw him and he told me then that if he was forced to leave her he should bequeath his little girl to me as a token of his love i cant fill his place but i shall try to be a father to her and if she learns to love me half as well as she did the good one she has lost i shall be a proud and happy man will she believe this and try  something in uncle alecs face touched rose to the heart and when he held out his hand with that anxious troubled look in his eyes she was moved to put up her innocent lips and seal the contract with a confiding kiss the strong arm held her close a minute and she felt the broad chest heave once as if with a great sigh of relief but not a word was spoken till a tap at the door made both start  rose popped her head through the window to say come in while dr alec hastily rubbed the sleeve of his jacket across his eyes and began to whistle again  phebe appeared with a cup of coffee  debby told me to bring this and help you get up she said opening her black eyes wide as if she wondered how on earth the sailor man got there  im all dressed so i dont need any help i hope that is good and strong added rose eyeing the steaming cup with an eager look  but she did not get it for a brown hand took possession of it as her uncle said quickly  hold hard my lass and let me overhaul that dose before you take it do you drink all this strong coffee every morning rose  yes sir and i like it auntie says it tones me up and i always feel better after it  this accounts for the sleepless nights the flutter your heart gets into at the least start and this is why that cheek of yours is pale yellow instead of rosy red no more coffee for you my dear and by and by youll see that i am right any new milk downstairs phebe  yes sir plenty right in from the barn  thats the drink for my patient go bring me a pitcherful and another cup i want a draught myself this wont hurt the honeysuckles for they have no nerves to speak of and to roses great discomfort the coffee went after the medicine  dr alec saw the injured look she put on but took no notice and presently banished it by saying pleasantly  ive got a capital little cup among my traps and ill give it to you to drink your milk in as it is made of wood that is supposed to improve whatever is put into it something like a quassia cup that reminds me one of the boxes phebe wanted to lug upstairs last night is for you knowing that i was coming home to find a readymade daughter i picked up all sorts of odd and pretty trifles along the way hoping she would be able to find something she liked among them all early tomorrow well have a grand rummage heres our milk i propose the health of miss rose campbell and drink it with all my heart  it was impossible for rose to pout with the prospect of a delightful boxful of gifts dancing before her eyes so in spite of herself she smiled as she drank her own health and found that fresh milk was not a hard dose to take  now i must be off before i am caught again with my wig in a toss  said dr alec preparing to descend the way he came  do you always go in and out like a cat uncle asked rose much amused at his odd ways  i used to sneak out of my window when i was a boy so i need not disturb the aunts and now i rather like it for its the shortest road and it keeps me limber when i have no rigging to climb goodbye till breakfast and away he went down the waterspout over the roof and vanished among the budding honeysuckles below  aint he a funny guardeen exclaimed phebe as she went off with the cups  he is a very kind one i think answered rose following to prowl round the big boxes and try to guess which was hers  when her uncle appeared at sound of the bell he found her surveying with an anxious face a new dish that smoked upon the table  got a fresh trouble rosy he asked stroking her smooth head  uncle are you going to make me eat oatmeal asked rose in a tragic tone  dont you like it  i detest it answered rose with all the emphasis which a turnedup nose a shudder and a groan could give to the three words  you are not a true scotchwoman if you dont like the parritch its a pity for i made it myself and thought wed have such a good time with all that cream to float it in well never mind and he sat down with a disappointed air  rose had made up her mind to be obstinate about it because she did heartily detest the dish but as uncle alec did not attempt to make her obey she suddenly changed her mind and thought she would  ill try to eat it to please you uncle but people are always saying how wholesome it is and that makes me hate it she said halfashamed at her silly excuse  i do want you to like it because i wish my girl to be as well and strong as jessies boys who are brought up on this in the good old fashion no hot bread and fried stuff for them and they are the biggest and bonniest lads of the lot bless you auntie and good morning  dr alec turned to greet the old lady and with a firm resolve to eat or die in the attempt rose sat down  in five minutes she forgot what she was eating so interested was she in the chat that went on it amused her very much to hear aunt plenty call her fortyyearold nephew my dear boy and uncle alec was so full of lively gossip about all creation in general and the aunthill in particular that the detested porridge vanished without a murmur  you will go to church with us i hope alec if you are not too tired  said the old lady when breakfast was over  i came all the way from calcutta for that express purpose maam only i must send the sisters word of my arrival for they dont expect me till tomorrow you know and there will be a row in church if those boys see me without warning  ill send ben up the hill and you can step over to myras yourself it will please her and you will have plenty of time  dr alec was off at once and they saw no more of him till the old barouche was at the door and aunt plenty just rustling downstairs in her sunday best with rose like a little black shadow behind her  away they drove in state and all the way uncle alecs hat was more off his head than on for everyone they met smiled and bowed and gave him as blithe a greeting as the day permitted  it was evident that the warning had been a wise one for in spite of time and place the lads were in such a ferment that their elders sat in momentary dread of an unseemly outbreak somewhere it was simply impossible to keep those fourteen eyes off uncle alec and the dreadful things that were done during sermontime will hardly be believed  rose dared not look up after a while for these bad boys vented their emotions upon her till she was ready to laugh and cry with mingled amusement and vexation charlie winked rapturously at her behind his mothers fan mac openly pointed to the tall figure beside her jamie stared fixedly over the back of his pew till rose thought his round eyes would drop out of his head george fell over a stool and dropped three books in his excitement will drew sailors and chinamen on his clean cuffs and displayed them to roses great tribulation steve nearly upset the whole party by burning his nose with salts as he pretended to be overcome by his joy even dignified archie disgraced himself by writing in his hymn book isnt he blue and brown and passing it politely to rose  her only salvation was trying to fix her attention upon uncle mac a portly placid gentleman who seemed entirely unconscious of the iniquities of the clan and dozed peacefully in his pew corner this was the only uncle rose had met for years for uncle jem and uncle steve the husbands of aunt jessie and aunt clara were at sea and aunt myra was a widow uncle mac was a merchant very rich and busy and as quiet as a mouse at home for he was in such a minority among the women folk he dared not open his lips and let his wife rule undisturbed  rose liked the big kindly silent man who came to her when papa died was always sending her splendid boxes of goodies at school and often invited her into his great warehouse full of teas and spices wines and all sorts of foreign fruits there to eat and carry away whatever she liked she had secretly regretted that he was not to be her guardian but since she had seen uncle alec she felt better about it for she did not particularly admire aunt jane  when church was over dr alec got into the porch as quickly as possible and there the young bears had a hug all round while the sisters shook hands and welcomed him with bright faces and glad hearts rose was nearly crushed flat behind a door in that dangerous passage from pew to porch but uncle mac rescued her and put her into the carriage for safe keeping  now girls i want you to come and dine with alec mac also of course but i cannot ask the boys for we did not expect this dear fellow till tomorrow you know so i made no preparations send the lads home and let them wait till monday for really i was shocked at their behaviour in church said aunt plenty as she followed rose  in any other place the defrauded boys would have set up a howl as it was they growled and protested till dr alec settled the matter by saying  never mind old chaps ill make it up to you tomorrow if you sheer off quietly if you dont not a blessed thing shall you have out of my big boxes    chapter 4 aunts  all dinnertime rose felt that she was going to be talked about and afterward she was sure of it for aunt plenty whispered to her as they went into the parlour  run up and sit awhile with sister peace my dear she likes to have you read while she rests and we are going to be busy  rose obeyed and the quiet rooms above were so like a church that she soon composed her ruffled feelings and was unconsciously a little minister of happiness to the sweet old lady who for years had sat there patiently waiting to be set free from pain  rose knew the sad romance of her life and it gave a certain tender charm to this greataunt of hers whom she already loved when peace was twenty she was about to be married all was done the wedding dress lay ready the flowers were waiting to be put on the happy hour at hand when word came that the lover was dead they thought that gentle peace would die too but she bore it bravely put away her bridal gear took up her life afresh and lived on a beautiful meek woman with hair as white as snow and cheeks that never bloomed again she wore no black but soft pale colours as if always ready for the marriage that had never come  for thirty years she had lived on fading slowly but cheerful busy and full of interest in all that went on in the family especially the joys and sorrows of the young girls growing up about her and to them she was adviser confidante and friend in all their tender trials and delights a truly beautiful old maiden with her silvery hair tranquil face and an atmosphere of repose about her that soothed whoever came to her  aunt plenty was utterly dissimilar being a stout brisk old lady with a sharp eye a lively tongue and a face like a winterapple always trotting chatting and bustling she was a regular martha cumbered with the cares of this world and quite happy in them  rose was right and while she softly read psalms to aunt peace the other ladies were talking about her little self in the frankest manner  well alec how do you like your ward began aunt jane as they all settled down and uncle mac deposited himself in a corner to finish his doze  i should like her better if i could have begun at the beginning and so got a fair start poor george led such a solitary life that the child has suffered in many ways and since he died she has been going on worse than ever judging from the state i find her in  my dear boy we did what we thought best while waiting for you to wind up your affairs and get home i always told george he was wrong to bring her up as he did but he never took my advice and now here we are with this poor dear child upon our hands i for one freely confess that i dont know what to do with her any more than if she was one of those strange outlandish birds you used to bring home from foreign parts  and aunt plenty gave a perplexed shake of the head which caused great commotion among the stiff loops of purple ribbon that bristled all over the cap like crocus buds  if my advice had been taken she would have remained at the excellent school where i placed her but our aunt thought best to remove her because she complained and she has been dawdling about ever since she came a most ruinous state of things for a morbid spoilt girl like rose said mrs jane severely  she had never forgiven the old ladies for yielding to roses pathetic petition that she might wait her guardians arrival before beginning another term at the school which was a regular blimber hotbed and turned out many a feminine toots  i never thought it the proper school for a child in good circumstances an heiress in fact as rose is it is all very well for girls who are to get their own living by teaching and that sort of thing but all she needs is a year or two at a fashionable finishing school so that at eighteen she can come out with eclat put in aunt clara who had been a beauty and a belle and was still a handsome woman  dear dear how shortsighted you all are to be discussing education and plans for the future when this unhappy child is so plainly marked for the tomb sighed aunt myra with a lugubrious sniff and a solemn wag of the funereal bonnet which she refused to remove being afflicted with a chronic catarrh  now it is my opinion that the dear thing only wants freedom rest and care there is look in her eyes that goes to my heart for it shows that she feels the need of what none of us can give her a mother said aunt jessie with tears in her own bright eyes at the thought of her boys being left as rose was to the care of others  uncle alec who had listened silently as each spoke turned quickly towards the last sister and said with a decided nod of approval  youve got it jessie and with you to help me i hope to make the child feel that she is not quite fatherless and motherless  ill do my best alec and i think you will need me for wise as you are you cannot understand a tender timid little creature like rose as a woman can said mrs jessie smiling back at him with a heart full of motherly goodwill  i cannot help feeling that i who have had a daughter of my own can best bring up a girl and i am very much surprised that george did not entrust her to me observed aunt myra with an air of melancholy importance for she was the only one who had given a daughter to the family and she felt that she had distinguished herself though illnatured people said that she had dosed her darling to death  i never blamed him in the least when i remember the perilous experiments you tried with poor carrie began mrs jane in her hard voice  jane campbell i will not hear a word my sainted caroline is a sacred object cried aunt myra rising as if to leave the room  dr alec detained her feeling that he must define his position at once and maintain it manfully if he hoped to have any success in his new undertaking  now my dear souls dont let us quarrel and make rose a bone of contention though upon my word she is almost a bone poor little lass you have had her among you for a year and done what you liked i cannot say that your success is great but that is owing to too many fingers in the pie now i intend to try my way for a year and if at the end of it she is not in better trim than now ill give up the case and hand her over to someone else thats fair i think  she will not be here a year hence poor darling so no one need dread future responsibility said aunt myra folding her black gloves as if all ready for the funeral  by jupiter myra you are enough to damp the ardour of a saint cried dr alec with a sudden spark in his eyes your croaking will worry that child out of her wits for she is an imaginative puss and will fret and fancy untold horrors you have put it into her head that she has no constitution and she rather likes the idea if she had not had a pretty good one she would have been marked for the tomb by this time at the rate you have been going on with her i will not have any interference please understand that so just wash your hands of her and let me manage till i want help then ill ask for it  hear hear came from the corner where uncle mac was apparently wrapt in slumber  you were appointed guardian so we can do nothing but i predict that the girl will be spoilt utterly spoilt answered mrs jane grimly  thank you sister i have an idea that if a woman can bring up two boys as perfectly as you do yours a man if he devotes his whole mind to it may at least attempt as much with one girl replied dr alec with a humorous look that tickled the others immensely for it was a wellknown fact in the family that janes boys were more indulged than all the other lads put together  i am quite easy for i really do think that alec will improve the childs health and by the time his year is out it will be quite soon enough for her to go to madame roccabellas and be finished off said aunt clara settling her rings and thinking with languid satisfaction of the time when she could bring out a pretty and accomplished niece  i suppose you will stay here in the old place unless you think of marrying and its high time you did put in mrs jane much nettled at her brothers last hit  no thank you come and have a cigar mac said dr alec abruptly  dont marry women enough in the family already muttered uncle mac and then the gentlemen hastily fled  aunt peace would like to see you all she says was the message rose brought before the ladies could begin again  hectic hectic dear me dear me murmured aunt myra as the shadow of her gloomy bonnet fell upon rose and the stiff tips of a black glove touched the cheek where the colour deepened under so many eyes  i am glad these pretty curls are natural they will be invaluable by and by said aunt clara taking an observation with her head on one side  now that your uncle has come i no longer expect you to review the studies of the past year i trust your time will not be entirely wasted in frivolous sports however added aunt jane sailing out of the room with the air of a martyr  aunt jessie said not a word but kissed her little niece with a look of tender sympathy that made rose cling to her a minute and follow her with grateful eyes as the door closed behind her  after everybody had gone home dr alec paced up and down the lower hall in the twilight for an hour thinking so intently that sometimes he frowned sometimes he smiled and more than once he stood still in a brown study all of a sudden he said half aloud as if he had made up his mind  i might as well begin at once and give the child something new to think about for myras dismals and janes lectures have made her as blue as a little indigo bag  diving into one of the trunks that stood in a corner he brought up after a brisk rummage a silken cushion prettily embroidered and a quaint cup of dark carved wood  this will do for a start he said as he plumped up the cushion and dusted the cup it wont do to begin too energetically or rose will be frightened i must beguile her gently and pleasantly along till ive won her confidence and then she will be ready for anything  just then phebe came out of the diningroom with a plate of brown bread for rose had been allowed no hot biscuit for tea  ill relieve you of some of that said dr alec and helping himself to a generous slice he retired to the study leaving phebe to wonder at his appetite  she would have wondered still more if she had seen him making that brown bread into neat little pills which he packed into an attractive ivory box out of which he emptied his own bits of lovage  there if they insist on medicine ill order these and no harm will be done i will have my own way but ill keep the peace if possible and confess the joke when my experiment has succeeded he said to himself looking very much like a mischievous boy as he went on with his innocent prescriptions  rose was playing softly on the small organ that stood in the upper hall so that aunt peace could enjoy it and all the while he talked with the old ladies uncle alec was listening to the fitful music of the child and thinking of another rose who used to play for him  as the clock struck eight he called out  time for my girl to be abed else she wont be up early and im full of jolly plans for tomorrow come and see what ive found for you to begin upon  rose ran in and listened with bright attentive face while dr alec said impressively  in my wanderings over the face of the earth i have picked up some excellent remedies and as they are rather agreeable ones i think you and i will try them this is a herbpillow given to me by a wise old woman when i was ill in india it is filled with saffron poppies and other soothing plants so lay your little head on it tonight sleep sweetly without a dream and wake tomorrow without a pain  shall i really how nice it smells and rose willingly received the pretty pillow and stood enjoying its faint sweet odour as she listened to the doctors next remedy  this is the cup i told you of its virtue depends they say on the drinker filling it himself so you must learn to milk ill teach you  im afraid i never can said rose but she surveyed the cup with favour for a funny little imp danced on the handle as if all ready to take a header into the white sea below  dont you think she ought to have something more strengthening than milk alec i really shall feel anxious if she does not have a tonic of some sort said aunt plenty eyeing the new remedies suspiciously for she had more faith in her oldfashioned doses than all the magic cups and poppy pillows of the east  well maam im willing to give her a pill if you think best it is a very simple one and very large quantities may be taken without harm you know hasheesh is the extract of hemp well this is a preparation of corn and rye much used in old times and i hope it will be again  dear me how singular said aunt plenty bringing her spectacles to bear upon the pills with a face so full of respectful interest that it was almost too much for dr alecs gravity  take one in the morning and a goodnight to you my dear he said dismissing his patient with a hearty kiss  then as she vanished he put both hands into his hair exclaiming with a comical mixture of anxiety and amusement  when i think what i have undertaken i declare to you aunt i feel like running away and not coming back till rose is eighteen    chapter 5 a belt and a box  when rose came out of her chamber cup in hand next morning the first person she saw was uncle alec standing on the threshold of the room opposite which he appeared to be examining with care when he heard her step he turned about and began to sing  where are you going my pretty maid  im going amilking sir she said answered rose waving the cup and then they finished the verse together in fine style  before either spoke a head in a nightcap so large and beruffled that it looked like a cabbage popped out of a room farther down the hall and an astonished voice exclaimed  what in the world are you doing about so early  clearing our pipes for the day maam look here auntie can i have this room said dr alec making her a sailors bow  any room you like except sisters  thanks and may i go rummaging round in the garrets and gloryholes to furnish it as i like  my dear boy you may turn the house upside down if you will only stay in it  thats a handsome offer im sure ill stay maam heres my little anchor so you will get more than you want of me this time  thats impossible put on your jacket rose dont tire her out with antics alec yes sister im coming and the cabbage vanished suddenly  the first milking lesson was a droll one but after several scares and many vain attempts rose at last managed to fill her cup while ben held clovers tail so that it could not flap and dr alec kept her from turning to stare at the new milkmaid who objected to both these proceedings very much  you look chilly in spite of all this laughing take a smart run round the garden and get up a glow said the doctor as they left the barn  im too old for running uncle miss power said it was not ladylike for girls in their teens answered rose primly  i take the liberty of differing from madame prunes and prisms and as your physician i order you to run off with you said uncle alec with a look and a gesture that made rose scurry away as fast as she could go  anxious to please him she raced round the beds till she came back to the porch where he stood and dropping down upon the steps she sat panting with cheeks as rosy as the rigolette on her shoulders  very well done child i see you have not lost the use of your limbs though you are in your teens that belt is too tight unfasten it then you can take a long breath without panting so  it isnt tight sir i can breathe perfectly well began rose trying to compose herself  her uncles only answer was to lift her up and unhook the new belt of which she was so proud the moment the clasp was open the belt flew apart several inches for it was impossible to restrain the involuntary sigh of relief that flatly contradicted her words  why i didnt know it was tight it didnt feel so a bit of course it would open if i puff like this but i never do because i hardly ever run explained rose rather discomfited by this discovery  i see you dont half fill your lungs and so you can wear this absurd thing without feeling it the idea of cramping a tender little waist in a stiff band of leather and steel just when it ought to be growing  said dr alec surveying the belt with great disfavour as he put the clasp forward several holes to roses secret dismay for she was proud of her slender figure and daily rejoiced that she wasnt as stout as luly miller a former schoolmate who vainly tried to repress her plumpness  it will fall off if it is so loose she said anxiously as she stood watching him pull her precious belt about  not if you keep taking long breaths to hold it on that is what i want you to do and when you have filled this out we will go on enlarging it till your waist is more like that of hebe goddess of health and less like that of a fashionplate the ugliest thing imaginable  how it does look and rose gave a glance of scorn at the loose belt hanging round her trim little waist it will be lost and then i shall feel badly for it cost ever so much and is real steel and russia leather just smell how nice  if it is lost ill give you a better one a soft silken sash is much fitter for a pretty child like you than a plated harness like this and ive got no end of italian scarfs and turkish sashes among my traps ah that makes you feel better doesnt it and he pinched the cheek that had suddenly dimpled with a smile  it is very silly of me but i cant help liking to know that here she stopped and blushed and held down her head ashamed to add you think i am pretty  dr alecs eyed twinkled but he said very soberly  rose are you vain  im afraid i am answered a very meek voice from behind the veil of hair that hid the red face  that is a sad fault and he sighed as if grieved at the confession  i know it is and i try not to be but people praise me and i cant help liking it for i really dont think i am repulsive  the last word and the funny tone in which it was uttered were too much for dr alec and he laughed in spite of himself to roses great relief  i quite agree with you and in order that you may be still less repulsive i want you to grow as fine a girl as phebe  phebe and rose looked so amazed that her uncle nearly went off again  yes phebe for she has what you need health if you dear little girls would only learn what real beauty is and not pinch and starve and bleach yourselves out so youd save an immense deal of time and money and pain a happy soul in a healthy body makes the best sort of beauty for man or woman do you understand that my dear  yes sir answered rose much taken down by this comparison with the girl from the poorhouse it nettled her sadly and she showed that it did by saying quickly  i suppose you would like to have me sweep and scrub and wear an old brown dress and go round with my sleeves rolled up as phebe does  i should very much if you could work as well as she does and show as strong a pair of arms as she can i havent seen a prettier picture for some time than she made of herself this morning up to the elbows in suds singing like a blackbird whilst she scrubbed on the back stoop  well i do think you are the queerest man that ever lived was all rose could find to say after this display of bad taste  i havent begun to show you my oddities yet so you must make up your mind to worse shocks than this he said with such a whimsical look that she was glad the sound of a bell prevented her showing more plainly what a blow her little vanities had already received  you will find your box all open up in aunties parlor and there you can amuse her and yourself by rummaging to your hearts content ive got to be cruising round all the morning getting my room to rights  said dr alec as they rose from breakfast  cant i help you uncle asked rose quite burning to be useful  no thank you im going to borrow phebe for a while if aunt plenty can spare her  anybody anything alec you will want me i know so ill give orders about dinner and be all ready to lend a hand and the old lady bustled away full of interest and goodwill  uncle will find that i can do some things that phebe cant so now  thought rose with a toss of the head as she flew to aunt peace and the longdesired box  every little girl can easily imagine what an extra good time she had diving into a sea of treasures and fishing up one pretty thing after another till the air was full of the mingled odours of musk and sandalwood the room gay with bright colours and rose in a rapture of delight she began to forgive dr alec for the oatmeal diet when she saw a lovely ivory workbox became resigned to the state of her belt when she found a pile of rainbowcoloured sashes and when she came to some distractingly pretty bottles of attar of rose she felt that they almost atoned for the great sin of thinking phebe the finer girl of the two  dr alec meanwhile had apparently taken aunt plenty at her word and was turning the house upside down a general revolution was evidently going on in the greenroom for the dark damask curtains were seen bundling away in phebes arms the airtight stove retiring to the cellar on bens shoulder and the great bedstead going up garret in a fragmentary state escorted by three bearers aunt plenty was constantly on the trot among her storerooms camphorchests and linenclosets looking as if the new order of things both amazed and amused her  half the peculiar performances of dr alec cannot be revealed but as rose glanced up from her box now and then she caught glimpses of him striding by bearing a bamboo chair a pair of ancient andirons a queer japanese screen a rug or two and finally a large bathingpan upon his head  what a curious room it will be she said as she sat resting and refreshing herself with lumps of delight all the way from cairo  i fancy you will like it deary answered aunt peace looking up with a smile from some pretty trifle she was making with blue silk and white muslin  rose did not see the smile for just at that moment her uncle paused at the door and she sprang up to dance before him saying with a face full of childish happiness  look at me look at me im splendid i dont know myself i havent put these things on right i dare say but i do like them so much  you look as gay as a parrot in your fez and cabaja and it does my heart good to see the little black shadow turned into a rainbow  said uncle alec surveying the bright figure before him with great approbation  he did not say it but he thought she made a much prettier picture than phebe at the washtub for she had stuck a purple fez on her blonde head tied several brilliant scarfs about her waist and put on a truly gorgeous scarlet jacket with a golden sun embroidered on the back a silver moon on the front and stars of all sizes on the sleeves a pair of turkish slippers adorned her feet and necklaces of amber coral and filigree hung about her neck while one hand held a smellingbottle and the other the spicy box of oriental sweetmeats  i feel like a girl in the arabian nights and expect to find a magic carpet or a wonderful talisman somewhere only i dont see how i ever can thank you for all these lovely things she said stopping her dance as if suddenly oppressed with gratitude  ill tell you how by leaving off the black clothes that never should have been kept so long on such a child and wearing the gay ones ive brought it will do your spirits good and cheer up this sober old house wont it auntie  i think you are right alec and it is fortunate that we have not begun on her spring clothes yet for myra thought she ought not to wear anything brighter than violet and she is too pale for that  you just let me direct miss hemming how to make some of these things you will be surprised to see how much i know about piping hems and gathering armholes and shirring biases began dr alec patting a pile of muslin cloth and silk with a knowing air  aunt peace and rose laughed so that he could not display his knowledge any farther till they stopped when he said goodnaturedly  that will go a great way toward filling out the belt so laugh away morgiana and ill go back to my work or i never shall be done  i couldnt help it shirred biases were so very funny rose said as she turned to her box after the splendid laugh but really auntie  she added soberly i feel as if i ought not to have so many nice things i suppose it wouldnt do to give phebe some of them uncle might not like it  he would not mind but they are not suitable for phebe some of the dresses you are done with would be more useful if they can be made over to fit her answered aunt peace in the prudent moderate tone which is so trying to our feelings when we indulge in little fits of charitable enthusiasm  id rather give her new ones for i think she is a little bit proud and might not like old things if she was my sister it would do because sisters dont mind but she isnt and that makes it bad you see i know how i can manage beautifully ill adopt her and rose looked quite radiant with this new idea  im afraid you could not do it legally till you are older but you might see if she likes the plan and at any rate you can be very kind to her for in one sense we are all sisters and should help one another  the sweet old face looked at her so kindly that rose was fired with a desire to settle the matter at once and rushed away to the kitchen just as she was phebe was there polishing up the antique andirons so busily that she started when a voice cried out  smell that taste this and look at me  phebe sniffed attar of rose crunched the lump of delight tucked into her mouth and stared with all her eyes at little morgiana prancing about the room like a brilliant paroquet  my stars aint you splendid was all she could say holding up two dusty hands  ive got heaps of lovely things upstairs and ill show them all to you and id go halves only auntie thinks they wouldnt be useful so i shall give you something else and you wont mind will you because i want to adopt you as arabella was in the story wont that be nice  why miss rose have you lost your wits  no wonder phebe asked for rose talked very fast and looked so odd in her new costume and was so eager she could not stop to explain seeing phebes bewilderment she quieted down and said with a pretty air of earnestness  it isnt fair that i should have so much and you so little and i want to be as good to you as if you were my sister for aunt peace says we are all sisters really i thought if i adopted you as much as i can now it would be nicer will you let me please  to roses great surprise phebe sat down on the floor and hid her face in her apron for a minute without answering a word  oh dear now shes offended and i dont know what to do thought rose much discouraged by this reception of her offer  please forgive me i didnt mean to hurt your feelings and hope you wont think  she faltered presently feeling that she must undo the mischief if possible  but phebe gave her another surprise by dropping the apron and showing a face all smiles in spite of tears in the eyes as she put both arms round rose and said with a laugh and sob  i think you are the dearest girl in the world and ill let you do anything you like with me  then you do like the plan you didnt cry because i seemed to be kind of patronising i truly didnt mean to be cried rose delighted  i guess i do like it and cried because no one was ever so good to me before and i couldnt help it as for patronising you may walk on me if you want to and i wont mind said phebe in a burst of gratitude for the words we are sisters went straight to her lonely heart and nestled there  well now we can play im a good sprite out of the box or what is better a fairy godmother come down the chimney and you are cinderella and must say what you want said rose trying to put the question delicately  phebe understood that for she had a good deal of natural refinement though she did come from the poorhouse  i dont feel as if i wanted anything now miss rose but to find some way of thanking you for all youve done she said rubbing off a tear that went rolling down the bridge of her nose in the most unromantic way  why i havent done anything but given you a bit of candy here have some more and eat em while you work and think what i can do i must go and clear up so goodbye and dont forget ive adopted you  youve given me sweeter things than candy and im not likely to forget it and carefully wiping off the brickdust phebe pressed the little hand rose offered warmly in both her hard ones while the black eyes followed the departing visitor with a grateful look that made them very soft and bright    chapter 6 uncle alecs room  soon after dinner and before she had got acquainted with half her new possessions dr alec proposed a drive to carry round the first instalment of gifts to the aunts and cousins rose was quite ready to go being anxious to try a certain soft burnous from the box which not only possessed a most engaging little hood but had funny tassels bobbing in all directions  the big carriage was full of parcels and even bens seat was loaded with indian war clubs a chinese kite of immense size and a pair of polished oxhorns from africa uncle alec very blue as to his clothes and very brown as to his face sat bolt upright surveying well known places with interest while rose feeling unusually elegant and comfortable leaned back folded in her soft mantle and played she was an eastern princess making a royal progress among her subjects  at three of the places their calls were brief for aunt myras catarrh was unusually bad aunt clara had a room full of company and aunt jane showed such a tendency to discuss the population productions and politics of europe asia and africa that even dr alec was dismayed and got away as soon as possible  now we will have a good time i do hope the boys will be at home said rose with a sigh of relief as they wound yet higher up the hill to aunt jessies  i left this for the last call so that we might find the lads just in from school yes there is jamie on the gate watching for us now youll see the clan gather they are always swarming about together  the instant jamie saw the approaching guests he gave a shrill whistle which was answered by echoes from meadow house and barn as the cousins came running from all directions shouting hooray for uncle alec  they went at the carriage like highwaymen robbed it of every parcel took the occupants prisoners and marched them into the house with great exultation  little mum little mum here they are with lots of goodies come down and see the fun right away quick bawled will and geordie amidst a general ripping off of papers and a reckless cutting of strings that soon turned the tidy room into a chaos  down came aunt jessie with her pretty cap half on but such a beaming face below it that one rather thought the flyaway headgear an improvement than otherwise she had hardly time to greet rose and the doctor before the boys were about her each clamouring for her to see his gift and rejoice over it with him for little mum went halves in everything the great horns skirmished about her as if to toss her to the ceiling the war clubs hurtled over her head as if to annihilate her an amazing medley from the four quarters of the globe filled her lap and seven excited boys all talked to her at once  but she liked it oh dear yes and sat smiling admiring and explaining quite untroubled by the din which made rose cover up her ears and dr alec threaten instant flight if the riot was not quelled that threat produced a lull and while the uncle received thanks in one corner the aunt had some little confidences made to her in the other  well dear and how are things going with you now better i hope than they were a week ago  aunt jessie i think im going to be very happy now uncle has come he does the queerest things but he is so good to me i cant help loving him and nestling closer to little mum rose told all that had happened ending with a rapturous account of the splendid box  i am very glad dear but rose i must warn you of one thing dont let uncle spoil you  but i like to be spoilt auntie  i dont doubt it but if you turn out badly when the year is over he will be blamed and his experiment prove a failure that would be a pity wouldnt it when he wants to do so much for you and can do it if his kind heart does not get in the way of his good judgment  i never thought of that and ill try not to be spoilt but how can i help it asked rose anxiously  by not complaining of the wholesome things he wants you to do by giving him cheerful obedience as well as love and even making some small sacrifices for his sake  i will i truly will and when i get in a worry about things may i come to you uncle told me to and i feel as if i shouldnt be afraid  you may darling this is the place where little troubles are best cured and this is what mothers are for i fancy and aunt jessie drew the curly head to her shoulder with a tender look that proved how well she knew what medicine the child most needed  it was so sweet and comfortable that rose sat still enjoying it till a little voice said  mamma dont you think pokey would like some of my shells rose gave phebe some of her nice things and it was very good of her can i  who is pokey asked rose popping up her head attracted by the odd name  my dolly do you want to see her asked jamie who had been much impressed by the tale of adoption he had overheard  yes im fond of dollies only dont tell the boys or they will laugh at me  they dont laugh at me and they play with my dolly a great deal but she likes me best and jamie ran away to produce his pet  i brought my old doll but i keep her hidden because i am too big to play with her and yet i cant bear to throw her away im so fond of her said rose continuing her confidences in a whisper  you can come and play with jamies whenever you like for we believe in dollies up here began aunt jessie smiling to herself as if something amused her  just then jamie came back and rose understood the smile for his dolly proved to be a pretty fouryearold little girl who trotted in as fast as her fat legs would carry her and making straight for the shells scrambled up an armful saying with a laugh that showed her little white teeth  all for dimmy and me for dimmy and me  thats my dolly isnt she a nice one asked jamie proudly surveying his pet with his hands behind him and his short legs rather far apart a manly attitude copied from his brothers  she is a dear dolly but why call her pokey asked rose charmed with the new plaything  she is such an inquisitive little body she is always poking that mite of a nose into everything and as paul pry did not suit the boys fell to calling her pokey not a pretty name but very expressive  it certainly was for having examined the shells the busy tot laid hold of everything she could find and continued her researches till archie caught her sucking his carved ivory chessmen to see if they were not barley sugar rice paper pictures were also discovered crumpled up in her tiny pocket and she nearly smashed wills ostrich egg by trying to sit upon it  here jim take her away shes worse than the puppies and we cant have her round commanded the elder brother picking her up and handing her over to the little fellow who received her with open arms and the warning remark  youd better mind what you do for im going to dopt pokey like rose did phebe and then youll have to be very good to her you big fellows  dopt away baby and ill give you a cage to keep her in or you wont have her long for she is getting worse than a monkey and archie went back to his mates while aunt jessie foreseeing a crisis proposed that jamie should take his dolly home as she was borrowed and it was time her visit ended  my dolly is better than yours isnt she cause she can walk and talk and sing and dance and yours cant do anything can she asked jamie with pride as he regarded his pokey who just then had been moved to execute a funny little jig and warble the wellknown couplet      pusstat pusstat where you been      i been lunnin to saw a tween  after which superb display she retired escorted by jamie both making a fearful din blowing on conch shells  we must tear ourselves away rose because i want to get you home before sunset will you come for a drive jessie said dr alec as the music died away in the distance  no thank you but i see the boys want a scamper so if you dont mind they may escort you home but not go in that is only allowed on holidays  the words were hardly out of aunt jessies mouth when archie said in a tone of command  pass the word lads boot and saddle and be quick about it  all right and in a moment not a vestige of boy remained but the litter on the floor  the cavalcade went down the hill at a pace that made rose cling to her uncles arm for the fat old horses got excited by the antics of the ponies careering all about them and went as fast as they could pelt with the gay dogcart rattling in front for archie and charlie scorned shelties since this magnificent equipage had been set up ben enjoyed the fun and the lads cut up capers till rose declared that circus was the proper name for them after all  when they reached the house they dismounted and stood three on each side the steps in martial attitudes while her ladyship was handed out with great elegance by uncle alec then the clan saluted mounted at word of command and with a wild whoop tore down the avenue in what they considered the true arab style  that was splendid now it is safely ended said rose skipping up the steps with her head over her shoulder to watch the dear tassels bob about  i shall get you a pony as soon as you are a little stronger said dr alec watching her with a smile  oh i couldnt ride one of those horrid frisky little beasts they roll their eyes and bounce about so i should die of fright cried rose clasping her hands tragically  are you a coward  about horses i am  never mind then come and see my new room and he led the way upstairs without another word  as rose followed she remembered her promise to aunt jessie and was sorry she had objected so decidedly she was a great deal more sorry five minutes later and well she might be  now take a good look and tell me what you think of it said dr alec opening the door and letting her enter before him while phebe was seen whisking down the backstairs with a dustpan  rose walked to the middle of the room stood still and gazed about her with eyes that brightened as they looked for all was changed  this chamber had been built out over the library to suit some fancy and had been unused for years except at christmas times when the old house overflowed it had three windows one to the east that overlooked the bay one to the south where the horsechestnuts waved their green fans and one to the west towards the hill and the evening sky a ruddy sunset burned there now filling the room with an enchanted glow the soft murmur of the sea was heard and a robin chirped goodnight  among the budding trees  rose saw and heard these things first and felt their beauty with a childs quick instinct then her eye took in the altered aspect of the room once so shrouded still and solitary now so full of light and warmth and simple luxury  india matting covered the floor with a gay rug here and there the antique andirons shone on the wide hearth where a cheery blaze dispelled the dampness of the longclosed room bamboo lounges and chairs stood about and quaint little tables in cosy corners one bearing a pretty basket one a desk and on a third lay several familiarlooking books in a recess stood a narrow white bed with a lovely madonna hanging over it the japanese screen halffolded back showed a delicate toilet service of blue and white set forth on a marble slab and near by was the great bathpan with turkish towels and a sponge as big as roses head  uncle must love cold water like a duck she thought with a shiver  then her eye went on to the tall cabinet where a halfopen door revealed a tempting array of the drawers shelves and cubby holes  which so delight the hearts of children  what a grand place for my new things she thought wondering what her uncle kept in that cedar retreat  oh me what a sweet toilet table was her next mental exclamation as she approached this inviting spot  a round oldfashioned mirror hung over it with a gilt eagle atop holding in his beak the knot of blue ribbon that tied up a curtain of muslin falling on either side of the table where appeared little ivoryhandled brushes two slender silver candlesticks a porcelain matchbox several pretty trays for small matters and most imposing of all a plump blue silk cushion coquettishly trimmed with lace and pink rosebuds at the corners  that cushion rather astonished rose in fact the whole table did and she was just thinking with a sly smile  uncle is a dandy but i never should have guessed it when he opened the door of a large closet saying with a careless wave of the hand  men like plenty of room for their rattletraps dont you think that ought to satisfy me  rose peeped in and gave a start though all she saw was what one usually finds in closets clothes and boots boxes and bags ah but you see these clothes were small black and white frocks the row of little boots that stood below had never been on dr alecs feet the green bandbox had a gray veil straying out of it and yes the bag hanging on the door was certainly her own piecebag with a hole in one corner she gave a quick look round the room and understood now why it had seemed too dainty for a man why her testament and prayer book were on the table by the bed and what those rosebuds meant on the blue cushion it came upon her in one delicious burst that this little paradise was all for her and not knowing how else to express her gratitude she caught dr alec round the neck saying impetuously  o uncle you are too good to me ill do anything you ask me ride wild horses and take freezing baths and eat badtasting messes and let my clothes hang on me to show how much i thank you for this dear sweet lovely room  you like it then but why do you think it is yours my lass asked dr alec as he sat down looking well pleased and drew his excited little niece to his knee  i dont think i know it is for me i see it in your face and i feel as if i didnt half deserve it aunt jessie said you would spoil me and i must not let you im afraid this looks like it and perhaps oh me perhaps i ought not to have this beautiful room after all and rose tried to look as if she could be heroic enough to give it up if it was best  i owe mrs jessie one for that said dr alec trying to frown though in his secret soul he felt that she was quite right then he smiled that cordial smile which was like sunshine on his brown face as he said  this is part of the cure rose and i put you here that you might take my three great remedies in the best and easiest way plenty of sun fresh air and cold water also cheerful surroundings and some work for phebe is to show you how to take care of this room and be your little maid as well as friend and teacher does that sound hard and disagreeable to you dear  no sir very very pleasant and ill do my best to be a good patient but i really dont think anyone could be sick in this delightful room she said with a long sigh of happiness as her eye went from one pleasant object to another  then you like my sort of medicine better than aunt myras and dont want to throw it out of the window hey    chapter 7 a trip to china  come little girl ive got another dose for you i fancy you wont take it as well as you did the last but you will like it better after a while said dr alec about a week after the grand surprise  rose was sitting in her pretty room where she would gladly have spent all her time if it had been allowed but she looked up with a smile for she had ceased to fear her uncles remedies and was always ready to try a new one the last had been a set of light gardening tools with which she had helped him put the flowerbeds in order learning all sorts of new and pleasant things about the plants as she worked for though she had studied botany at school it seemed very dry stuff compared with uncle alecs lively lesson  what is it now she asked shutting her workbox without a murmur  saltwater  how must i take it  put on the new suit miss hemming sent home yesterday and come down to the beach then ill show you  yes sir answered rose obediently adding to herself with a shiver as he went off  it is too early for bathing so i know it is something to do with a dreadful boat  putting on the new suit of blue flannel prettily trimmed with white and the little sailorhat with long streamers diverted her mind from the approaching trial till a shrill whistle reminded her that her uncle was waiting away she ran through the garden down the sandy path out upon the strip of beach that belonged to the house and here she found dr alec busy with a slender red and white boat that lay rocking on the rising tide  that is a dear little boat and bonnie belle is a pretty name she said trying not to show how nervous she felt  it is for you so sit in the stern and learn to steer till you are ready to learn to row  do all boats wiggle about in that way she asked lingering as if to tie her hat more firmly  oh yes pitch about like nutshells when the sea is a bit rough  answered her sailor uncle never guessing her secret woe  is it rough today  not very it looks a trifle squally to the eastward but we are all right till the wind changes come  can you swim uncle asked rose clutching at his arm as he took her hand  like a fish now then  oh please hold me very tight till i get there why do you have the stern so far away and stifling several squeaks of alarm in her passage rose crept to the distant seat and sat there holding on with both hands and looking as if she expected every wave to bring a sudden shipwreck  uncle alec took no notice of her fear but patiently instructed her in the art of steering till she was so absorbed in remembering which was starboard and which larboard that she forgot to say ow every time a big wave slapped against the boat  now where shall we go she asked as the wind blew freshly in her face and a few long swift strokes sent them half across the little bay  suppose we go to china  isnt that rather a long voyage  not as i go steer round the point into the harbour and ill give you a glimpse of china in twenty minutes or so  i should like that and rose sat wondering what he meant while she enjoyed the new sights all about her  behind them the green aunthill sloped gently upward to the grove at the top and all along the seaward side stood familiar houses stately cosy or picturesque as they rounded the point the great bay opened before them full of shipping and the city lay beyond its spires rising above the tall masts with their gay streamers  are we going there she asked for she had never seen this aspect of the rich and busy old city before  yes uncle mac has a ship just in from hong kong and i thought you would like to go and see it  oh i should i love dearly to go poking about in the warehouses with uncle mac everything is so curious and new to me and im specially interested in china because you have been there  ill show you two genuine chinamen who have just arrived you will like to welcome whang lo and fun see im sure  dont ask me to speak to them uncle i shall be sure to laugh at the odd names and the pigtails and the slanting eyes please let me just trot round after you i like that best  very well now steer toward the wharf where the big ship with the queer flag is thats the rajah and we will go aboard if we can  in among the ships they went by the wharves where the water was green and still and queer barnacles grew on the slippery piles odd smells saluted her nose and odd sights met her eyes but rose liked it all and played she was really landing in hong kong when they glided up to the steps in the shadow of the tall rajah boxes and bales were rising out of the hold and being carried into the warehouse by stout porters who tugged and bawled and clattered about with small trucks or worked cranes with iron claws that came down and clutched heavy weights whisking them aloft to where wide doors like mouths swallowed them up  dr alec took her aboard the ship and she had the satisfaction of poking her inquisitive little nose into every available corner at the risk of being crushed lost or drowned  well child how would you like to take a voyage round the world with me in a jolly old craft like this asked her uncle as they rested a minute in the captains cabin  i should like to see the world but not in such a small untidy smelly place as this we would go in a yacht all clean and comfortable charlie says that is the proper way answered rose surveying the close quarters with little favour  you are not a true campbell if you dont like the smell of tar and saltwater nor charlie either with his luxurious yacht now come ashore and chinchin with the celestials  after a delightful progress through the great warehouse peeping and picking as they went they found uncle mac and the yellow gentlemen in his private room where samples gifts curiosities and newly arrived treasures of all sorts were piled up in pleasing profusion and confusion  as soon as possible rose retired to a corner with a porcelain god on one side a green dragon on the other and what was still more embarrassing fun see sat on a teachest in front and stared at her with his beady black eyes till she did not know where to look  mr whang lo was an elderly gentleman in american costume with his pigtail neatly wound round his head he spoke english and was talking busily with uncle mac in the most commonplace way so rose considered him a failure but fun see was delightfully chinese from his junklike shoes to the button on his pagoda hat for he had got himself up in style and was a mass of silk jackets and slouchy trousers he was short and fat and waddled comically his eyes were very slanting as rose said his queue was long so were his nails his yellow face was plump and shiny and he was altogether a highly satisfactory chinaman  uncle alec told her that fun see had come out to be educated and could only speak a little pigeon english so she must be kind to the poor fellow for he was only a lad though he looked nearly as old as mr whang lo rose said she would be kind but had not the least idea how to entertain the queer guest who looked as if he had walked out of one of the ricepaper landscapes on the wall and sat nodding at her so like a toy mandarin that she could hardly keep sober  in the midst of her polite perplexity uncle mac saw the two young people gazing wistfully at one another and seemed to enjoy the joke of this making acquaintance under difficulties taking a box from his table he gave it to fun see with an order that seemed to please him very much  descending from his perch he fell to unpacking it with great neatness and despatch while rose watched him wondering what was going to happen presently out from the wrappings came a teapot which caused her to clasp her hands with delight for it was made in the likeness of a plump little chinaman his hat was the cover his queue the handle and his pipe the nose it stood upon feet in shoes turned up at the toes and the smile on the fat sleepy face was so like that on funs when he displayed the teapot that rose couldnt help laughing which pleased him much  two pretty cups with covers and a fine scarlet tray completed the set and made one long to have a dish of tea even in chinese style without cream or sugar  when he had arranged them on a little table before her fun signified in pantomime that they were hers from her uncle she returned her thanks in the same way whereupon he returned to his teachest and having no other means of communication they sat smiling and nodding at one another in an absurd sort of way till a new idea seemed to strike fun tumbling off his seat he waddled away as fast as his petticoats permitted leaving rose hoping that he had not gone to get a roasted rat a stewed puppy or any other foreign mess which civility would oblige her to eat  while she waited for her funny new friend she improved her mind in a way that would have charmed aunt jane the gentlemen were talking over all sorts of things and she listened attentively storing up much of what she heard for she had an excellent memory and longed to distinguish herself by being able to produce some useful information when reproached with her ignorance  she was just trying to impress upon her mind that amoy was two hundred and eighty miles from hong kong when fun came scuffling back bearing what she thought was a small sword till he unfurled an immense fan and presented it with a string of chinese compliments the meaning of which would have amused her even more than the sound if she could have understood it  she had never seen such an astonishing fan and at once became absorbed in examining it of course there was no perspective whatever which only gave it a peculiar charm to rose for in one place a lovely lady with blue knittingneedles in her hair sat directly upon the spire of a stately pagoda in another charming view a brook appeared to flow in at the front door of a stout gentlemans house and out at his chimney in a third a zigzag wall went up into the sky like a flash of lightning and a bird with two tails was apparently brooding over a fisherman whose boat was just going aground upon the moon  it was altogether a fascinating thing and she would have sat wafting it to and fro all the afternoon to funs great satisfaction if dr alecs attention had not suddenly been called to her by a breeze from the big fan that blew his hair into his eyes and reminded him that they must go so the pretty china was repacked rose furled her fan and with several parcels of choice teas for the old ladies stowed away in dr alecs pockets they took their leave after fun had saluted them with the three bendings and the nine knockings as they salute the emperor or son of heaven at home  i feel as if i had really been to china and im sure i look so said rose as they glided out of the shadow of the rajah  she certainly did for mr whang lo had given her a chinese umbrella uncle alec had got some lanterns to light up her balcony the great fan lay in her lap and the teaset reposed at her feet  this is not a bad way to study geography is it asked her uncle who had observed her attention to the talk  it is a very pleasant way and i really think i have learned more about china today than in all the lessons i had at school though i used to rattle off the answers as fast as i could go no one explained anything to us so all i remember is that tea and silk come from there and the women have little bits of feet i saw fun looking at mine and he must have thought them perfectly immense answered rose surveying her stout boots with sudden contempt  we will have out the maps and the globe and ill show you some of my journeys telling stories as we go that will be next best to doing it actually  you are so fond of travelling i should think it would be very dull for you here uncle do you know aunt plenty says she is sure you will be off in a year or two  very likely  oh me what shall i do then sighed rose in a tone of despair that made uncle alecs face brighten with a look of genuine pleasure as he said significantly  next time i go i shall take my little anchor with me how will that suit  really uncle  really niece  rose gave a little bounce of rapture which caused the boat to wiggle  in a way that speedily quieted her down but she sat beaming joyfully and trying to think which of some hundred questions she would ask first when dr alec said pointing to a boat that was coming up behind them in great style  how well those fellows row look at them and take notes for your own use by and by  the stormy petrel was manned by half a dozen jaunty looking sailors who made a fine display of blue shirts and shiny hats with stars and anchors in every direction  how beautifully they go and they are only boys why i do believe they are our boys yes i see charlie laughing over his shoulder row uncle row oh please do and not let them catch up with us cried rose in such a state of excitement that the new umbrella nearly went overboard  all right here we go and away they did go with a long steady sweep of the oars that carried the bonnie belle through the water with a rush  the lads pulled their prettiest but dr alec would have reached the point first if rose in her flurry had not retarded him by jerking the rudder ropes in a most unseamanlike way and just as she got right again her hat blew off that put an end to the race and while they were still fishing for the hat the other boat came alongside with all the oars in the air and the jolly young tars ready for a frolic  did you catch a crab uncle  no a bluefish he answered as the dripping hat was landed on a seat to dry  what have you been doing  seeing fun  good for you rose i know what you mean we are going to have him up to show us how to fly the big kite for we cant get the hang of it isnt he great fun though  no little fun  come stop joking and show us what youve got  youd better hoist that fan for a sail  lend dandy your umbrella he hates to burn his pretty nose  i say uncle are you going to have a feast of lanterns  no im going to have a feast of bread and butter for its teatime if that black cloud doesnt lie we shall have a gust before long so you had better get home as soon as you can or your mother will be anxious archie  ay ay skipper goodnight rose come out often and well teach you all there is to know about rowing was charlies modest invitation  then the boats parted company and across the water from the petrels  crew came a verse from one of the nonsense songs in which the boys delighted      oh timballoo how happy we are      we live in a sieve and a crockery jar      and all night long in the starlight pale      we sail away with a peagreen sail      and whistle and warble a moony song      to the echoing sound of a coppery gong      far and few far and few      are the lands where the jumblies live      their heads are green and their hands are blue      and they went to sea in a sieve    chapter 8 and what came of it  uncle could you lend me a ninepence ill return it as soon as i get my pocketmoney said rose coming into the library in a great hurry that evening  i think i could and i wont charge any interest for it so you need not be in any hurry to repay me come back here and help me settle these books if you have nothing pleasanter to do answered dr alec handing out the money with that readiness which is so delightful when we ask small loans  ill come in a minute ive been longing to fix my books but didnt dare to touch them because you always shake your head when i read  i shall shake my head when you write if you dont do it better than you did in making out this catalogue  i know its bad but i was in a hurry when i did it and i am in one now and away went rose glad to escape a lecture  but she got it when she came back for uncle alec was still knitting his brows over the list of books and sternly demanded pointing to a tipsylooking title staggering down the page  is that meant for pulverized bones maam  no sir its paradise lost  well im glad to know it for i began to think you were planning to study surgery or farming and what is this if you please babies aprons is all i can make of it  rose looked hard at the scrawl and presently announced with an air of superior wisdom  oh thats bacons essays  miss power did not teach anything so oldfashioned as writing i see now look at this memorandum aunt plenty gave me and see what a handsome plain hand that is she went to a dameschool and learnt a few useful things well that is better than a smattering of half a dozen socalled higher branches i take the liberty of thinking  well im sure i was considered a bright girl at school and learned everything i was taught luly and me were the first in all our classes and specially praised for our french and music and those sort of things said rose rather offended at uncle alecs criticism  i dare say but if your french grammar was no better than your english i think the praise was not deserved my dear  why uncle we did study english grammar and i could parse beautifully miss power used to have us up to show off when people came i dont see but i talk as right as most girls  i dare say you do but we are all too careless about our english now think a minute and tell me if these expressions are correct luly and me those sort of things and as right as most girls  rose pulled her pet curl and put up her lip but had to own that she was wrong and said meekly after a pause which threatened to be sulky  i suppose i should have said luly and i in that case and that sort of things and rightly though correctly would have been a better word i guess  thank you and if you will kindly drop i guess i shall like my little yankee all the better now see here rosy i dont pretend to set myself up for a model in anything and you may come down on my grammar manners or morals as often as you think im wrong and ill thank you ive been knocking about the world for years and have got careless but i want my girl to be what i call welleducated even if she studies nothing but the three rs for a year to come let us be thorough no matter how slowly we go  he spoke so earnestly and looked so sorry to have ruffled her that rose went and sat on the arm of his chair saying with a pretty air of penitence  im sorry i was cross uncle when i ought to thank you for taking so much interest in me i guess no i think you are right about being thorough for i used to understand a great deal better when papa taught me a few lessons than when miss power hurried me through so many i declare my head used to be such a jumble of french and german history and arithmetic grammar and music i used to feel sometimes as if it would split im sure i dont wonder it ached and she held on to it as if the mere memory of the jumble made it swim  yet that is considered an excellent school i find and i dare say it would be if the benighted lady did not think it necessary to cram her pupils like thanksgiving turkeys instead of feeding them in a natural and wholesome way it is the fault with most american schools and the poor little heads will go on aching till we learn better  this was one of dr alecs hobbies and rose was afraid he was off for a gallop but he reined himself in and gave her thoughts a new turn by saying suddenly as he pulled out a fat pocketbook  uncle mac has put all your affairs into my hands now and here is your months pocket money you keep your own little accounts i suppose  thank you yes uncle mac gave me an account book when i went to school and i used to put down my expenses but i couldnt make them go very well for figures are the one thing i am not at all clever about  said rose rummaging in her desk for a dilapidated little book which she was ashamed to show when she found it  well as figures are rather important things to most of us and you may have a good many accounts to keep some day wouldnt it be wise to begin at once and learn to manage your pennies before the pounds come to perplex you  i thought you would do all that fussy part and take care of the pounds as you call them need i worry about it i do hate sums so  i shall take care of things till you are of age but i mean that you shall know how your property is managed and do as much of it as you can by and by then you wont be dependent on the honesty of other people  gracious me as if i wouldnt trust you with millions of billions if i had them cried rose scandalised at the mere suggestion  ah but i might be tempted guardians are sometimes so youd better keep your eye on me and in order to do that you must learn all about these affairs answered dr alec as he made an entry in his own very neat accountbook  rose peeped over his shoulder at it and then turned to the arithmetical puzzle in her hand with a sigh of despair  uncle when you add up your expenses do you ever find you have got more money than you had in the beginning  no i usually find that i have a good deal less than i had in the beginning are you troubled in the peculiar way you mention  yes it is very curious but i never can make things come out square  perhaps i can help you began uncle alec in the most respectful tone  i think you had better for if i have got to keep accounts i may as well begin in the right way but please dont laugh i know im very stupid and my book is a disgrace but i never could get it straight  and with great trepidation rose gave up her funny little accounts  it really was good in dr alec not to laugh and rose felt deeply grateful when he said in a mildly suggestive tone  the dollars and cents seem to be rather mixed perhaps if i just straightened them out a bit we should find things all right  please do and then show me on a fresh leaf how to make mine look nice and shipshape as yours do  as rose stood by him watching the ease with which he quickly brought order out of chaos she privately resolved to hunt up her old arithmetic and perfect herself in the four first rules with a good tug at fractions before she read any more fairy tales  am i a rich girl uncle she asked suddenly as he was copying a column of figures  rather a poor one i should say since you had to borrow a ninepence  that was your fault because you forgot my pocketmoney but really shall i be rich by and by  i am afraid you will  why afraid uncle  too much money is a bad thing  but i can give it away you know that is always the pleasantest part of having it i think  im glad you feel so for you can do much good with your fortune if you know how to use it well  you shall teach me and when i am a woman we will set up a school where nothing but the three rs shall be taught and all the children live on oatmeal and the girls have waists a yard round said rose with a sudden saucy smile dimpling her cheeks  you are an impertinent little baggage to turn on me in that way right in the midst of my first attempt at teaching never mind ill have an extra bitter dose for you next time miss  i knew you wanted to laugh so i gave you a chance now i will be good master and do my lesson nicely  so dr alec had his laugh and then rose sat down and took a lesson in accounts which she never forgot  now come and read aloud to me my eyes are tired and it is pleasant to sit here by the fire while the rain pours outside and aunt jane lectures upstairs said uncle alec when last months accounts had been put in good order and a fresh page neatly begun  rose liked to read aloud and gladly gave him the chapter in nicholas nickleby where the miss kenwigses take their french lesson she did her very best feeling that she was being criticised and hoping that she might not be found wanting in this as in other things  shall i go on sir she asked very meekly when the chapter ended  if you are not tired dear it is a pleasure to hear you for you read remarkably well was the answer that filled her heart with pride and pleasure  do you really think so uncle im so glad papa taught me and i read for hours to him but i thought perhaps he liked it because he was fond of me  so am i but you really do read unusually well and im very glad of it for it is a rare accomplishment and one i value highly come here in this cosy low chair the light is better and i can pull these curls if you go too fast i see you are going to be a great comfort as well as a great credit to your old uncle rosy and dr alec drew her close beside him with such a fatherly look and tone that she felt it would be very easy to love and obey him since he knew how to mix praise and blame so pleasantly together  another chapter was just finished when the sound of a carriage warned them that aunt jane was about to depart before they could go to meet her however she appeared in the doorway looking like an unusually tall mummy in her waterproof with her glasses shining like cats eyes from the depths of the hood  just as i thought petting that child to death and letting her sit up late reading trash i do hope you feel the weight of the responsibility you have taken upon yourself alec she said with a certain grim sort of satisfaction at seeing things go wrong  i think i have a very realising sense of it sister jane answered dr alec with a comical shrug of the shoulders and a glance at roses bright face  it is sad to see a great girl wasting these precious hours so now my boys have studied all day and mac is still at his books ive no doubt while you have not had a lesson since you came i suspect  ive had five today maam was roses very unexpected answer  im glad to hear it and what were they pray rose looked very demure as she replied  navigation geography grammar arithmetic and keeping my temper  queer lessons i fancy and what have you learned from this remarkable mixture i should like to know  a naughty sparkle came into roses eyes as she answered with a droll look at her uncle  i cant tell you all maam but i have collected some useful information about china which you may like especially the teas the best are lapsing souchong assam pekoe rare ankoe flowery pekoe howquas mixture scented caper padral tea black congou and green twankey shanghai is on the woosung river hong kong means island of sweet waters singapore is lions town chops are the boats they live in and they drink tea out of little saucers principal productions are porcelain tea cinnamon shawls tin tamarinds and opium they have beautiful temples and queer gods and in canton is the dwelling of the holy pigs fourteen of them very big and all blind  the effect of this remarkable burst was immense especially the fact last mentioned it entirely took the wind out of aunt janes sails it was so sudden so varied and unexpected that she had not a word to say the glasses remained fixed full upon rose for a moment and then with a hasty oh indeed the excellent lady bundled into her carriage and drove away somewhat bewildered and very much disturbed  she would have been more so if she had seen her reprehensible brotherinlaw dancing a triumphal polka down the hall with rose in honour of having silenced the enemys battery for once    chapter 9 phebes secret  why do you keep smiling to yourself phebe asked rose as they were working together one morning for dr alec considered housework the best sort of gymnastics for girls so rose took lessons of phebe in sweeping dusting and bedmaking  i was thinking about a nice little secret i know and couldnt help smiling  shall i know it sometime  guess you will  shall i like it  oh wont you though  will it happen soon  sometime this week  i know what it is the boys are going to have fireworks on the fourth and have got some surprise for me havent they  thats telling  well i can wait only tell me one thing is uncle in it  of course he is theres never any fun without him  then its all right and sure to be nice  rose went out on the balcony to shake the rugs and having given them a vigorous beating hung them on the balustrade to air while she took a look at her plants several tall vases and jars stood there and a month of june sun and rain had worked wonders with the seeds and slips she had planted morningglories and nasturtiums ran all over the bars making haste to bloom scarlet beans and honeysuckles were climbing up from below to meet their pretty neighbours and the woodbine was hanging its green festoons wherever it could cling  the waters of the bay were dancing in the sunshine a fresh wind stirred the chestnuttrees with a pleasant sound and the garden below was full of roses butterflies and bees a great chirping and twittering went on among the birds busy with their summer housekeeping and far away the whitewinged gulls were dipping and diving in the sea where ships like larger birds went sailing to and fro  oh phebe its such a lovely day i do wish your fine secret was going to happen right away i feel just like having a good time dont you  said rose waving her arms as if she was going to fly  i often feel that way but i have to wait for my good times and dont stop working to wish for em there now you can finish as soon as the dust settles i must go do my stairs and phebe trudged away with the broom singing as she went  rose leaned where she was and fell to thinking how many good times she had had lately for the gardening had prospered finely and she was learning to swim and row and there were drives and walks and quiet hours of reading and talk with uncle alec and best of all the old pain and ennui seldom troubled her now she could work and play all day sleep sweetly all night and enjoy life with the zest of a healthy happy child she was far from being as strong and hearty as phebe but she was getting on the once pale cheeks had colour in them now the hands were growing plump and brown and the belt was not much too loose no one talked to her about her health and she forgot that she had no constitution she took no medicine but dr alecs three great remedies and they seemed to suit her excellently aunt plenty said it was the pills but as no second batch had ever followed the first i think the old lady was mistaken  rose looked worthy of her name as she stood smiling to herself over a happier secret than any phebe had a secret which she did not know herself till she found out some years later the magic of good health      look only said the brownie      at the pretty gown of blue      at the kerchief pinned about her head      and at her little shoe  said a voice from below as a great cabbagerose came flying against her cheek  what is the princess dreaming about up there in her hanginggarden  added dr alec as she flung back a morningglory  i was wishing i could do something pleasant this fine day something very new and interesting for the wind makes me feel frisky and gay  suppose we take a pull over to the island i intended to go this afternoon but if you feel more like it now we can be off at once  i do i do ill come in fifteen minutes uncle i must just scrabble my room to rights for phebe has got a great deal to do  rose caught up the rugs and vanished as she spoke while dr alec went in saying to himself with an indulgent smile  it may upset things a trifle but half a childs pleasure consists in having their fun when they want it  never did duster flap more briskly than the one rose used that day and never was a room scrabbled to rights in such haste as hers tables and chairs flew into their places as if alive curtains shook as if a gale was blowing china rattled and small articles tumbled about as if a young earthquake was playing with them the boating suit went on in a twinkling and rose was off with a hop and a skip little dreaming how many hours it would be before she saw her pretty room again  uncle alec was putting a large basket into the boat when she arrived and before they were off phebe came running down with a queer knobby bundle done up in a waterproof  we cant eat half that luncheon and i know we shall not need so many wraps i wouldnt lumber the boat up so said rose who still had secret scares when on the water  couldnt you make a smaller parcel phebe asked dr alec eyeing the bundle suspiciously  no sir not in such a hurry and phebe laughed as she gave a particularly large knob a good poke  well it will do for ballast dont forget the note to mrs jessie i beg of you  no sir ill send it right off and phebe ran up the bank as if she had wings to her feet  well take a look at the lighthouse first for you have not been there yet and it is worth seeing by the time we have done that it will be pretty warm and we will have lunch under the trees on the island  rose was ready for anything and enjoyed her visit to the lighthouse on the point very much especially climbing up the narrow stairs and going inside the great lantern they made a long stay for dr alec seemed in no hurry to go and kept looking through his spyglass as if he expected to discover something remarkable on sea or land it was past twelve before they reached the island and rose was ready for her lunch long before she got it  now this is lovely i do wish the boys were here wont it be nice to have them with us all their vacation why it begins today doesnt it oh i wish id remembered it sooner and perhaps they would have come with us she said as they lay luxuriously eating sandwiches under the old appletree  so we might next time we wont be in such a hurry i expect the lads will take our heads off when they find us out answered dr alec placidly drinking cold tea  uncle i smell a frying sort of a smell rose said pausing suddenly as she was putting away the remains of the lunch half an hour later  so do i it is fish i think  for a moment they both sat with their noses in the air sniffing like hounds then dr alec sprang up saying with great decision  now this wont do no one is permitted on this island without asking leave i must see who dares to fry fish on my private property  taking the basket on one arm and the bundle on the other he strode away towards the traitorous smell looking as fierce as a lion while rose marched behind under her umbrella  we are robinson crusoe and his man friday going to see if the savages have come she said presently for her fancy was full of the dear old stories that all children love so well  and there they are two tents and two boats as i live these rascals mean to enjoy themselves thats evident  there ought to be more boats and no tents i wonder where the prisoners are  there are traces of them and dr alec pointed to the heads and tails of fishes strewn on the grass  and there are more said rose laughing as she pointed to a scarlet heap of what looked like lobsters  the savages are probably eating their victims now dont you hear the knives rattle in that tent  we ought to creep up and peep crusoe was cautious you know and friday scared out of his wits added rose still keeping up the joke  but this crusoe is going to pounce upon them regardless of consequences if i am killed and eaten you seize the basket and run for the boat there are provisions enough for your voyage home  with that uncle alec slipped round to the front of the tent and casting in the big bundle like a bombshell roared out in a voice of thunder  pirates surrender  a crash a shout a laugh and out came the savages brandishing knives and forks chicken bones and tin mugs and all fell upon the intruder pommelling him unmercifully as they cried  you came too soon we are not half ready youve spoilt it all where is rose  here i am answered a halfstifled voice and rose was discovered sitting on the pile of red flannel bathing clothes which she had mistaken for lobsters and where she had fallen in a fit of merriment when she discovered that the cannibals were her merry cousins  you goodfornothing boys you are always bursting out upon me in some ridiculous way and i always get taken in because im not used to such pranks uncle is as bad as the rest and its great fun she said as the lads came round her half scolding half welcoming and wholly enjoying the double surprise  you were not to come till afternoon and mamma was to be here to receive you everything is in a mess now except your tent we got that in order the first thing and you can sit there and see us work said archie doing the honours as usual  rose felt it in her bones as dolly says that something was in the wind and wanted to be off at once so i let her come and should have kept her away an hour longer if your fish had not betrayed you  explained uncle alec subsiding from a ferocious crusoe into his goodnatured self again  as this seat is rather damp i think ill rise said rose as the excitement lessened a little  several fishy hands helped her up and charlie said as he scattered the scarlet garments over the grass with an oar  we had a jolly good swim before dinner and i told the brats to spread these to dry hope you brought your things rose for you belong to the lobsters you know and we can have no end of fun teaching you to dive and float and tread water  i didnt bring anything  began rose but was interrupted by the brats otherwise will and geordie who appeared bearing the big bundle so much demoralised by its fall that a red flannel tunic trailed out at one end and a little blue dressinggown at the other while the knobs proved to be a toiletcase rubbers and a silver mug  oh that sly phebe this was the secret and she bundled up those things after i went down to the boat cried rose with sparkling eyes  guess something is smashed inside for a bit of glass fell out  observed will as they deposited the bundle at her feet  catch a girl going anywhere without a lookingglass we havent got one among the whole lot of us added mac with masculine scorn  dandy has i caught him touching up his wig behind the trees after our swim cut in geordie wagging a derisive finger at steve who promptly silenced him by a smart rap on the head with the drumstick he had just polished off  come come you lazy lubbers fall to work or we shall not be ready for mamma take roses things to her tent and tell her all about it prince mac and steve you cut away and bring up the rest of the straw and you small chaps clear off the table if you have stuffed all you can please uncle id like your advice about the boundary lines and the best place for the kitchen  everyone obeyed the chief and rose was escorted to her tent by charlie who devoted himself to her service she was charmed with her quarters and still more so with the programme which he unfolded before her as they worked  we always camp out somewhere in vacation and this year we thought wed try the island it is handy and our fireworks will show off well from here  shall we stay over the fourth three whole days oh me what a frolic it will be  bless your heart we often camp for a week we big fellows but this year the small chaps wanted to come so we let them we have great larks as youll see for we have a cave and play captain kidd and have shipwrecks and races and all sorts of games arch and i are rather past that kind of thing now but we do it to please the children added charlie with a sudden recollection of his sixteen years  i had no idea boys had such good times their plays never seemed a bit interesting before but i suppose that was because i never knew any boys very well or perhaps you are unusually nice ones observed rose with an artless air of appreciation that was very flattering  we are a pretty clever set i fancy but we have a good many advantages you see there are a tribe of us to begin with then our family has been here for ages and we have plenty of spondulics so we can rather lord it over the other fellows and do as we like there maam you can hang your smashed glass on that nail and do up your back hair as fine as you please you can have a blue blanket or a red one and a straw pillow or an air cushion for your head whichever you like you can trim up to any extent and be as free and easy as squaws in a wigwam for this corner is set apart for you ladies and we never cross the line uncle is drawing until we ask leave anything more i can do for you cousin  no thank you i think ill leave the rest till auntie comes and go and help you somewhere else if i may  yes indeed come on and see to the kitchen can you cook asked charlie as he led the way to the rocky nook where archie was putting up a sailcloth awning  i can make tea and toast bread  well well shew you how to fry fish and make chowder now you just set these pots and pans round tastefully and sort of tidy up a bit for aunt jessie insists on doing some of the work and i want it to be decent here  by four oclock the camp was in order and the weary workers settled down on lookout rock to watch for mrs jessie and jamie who was never far from mammas apron string they looked like a flock of bluebirds all being in sailor rig with blue ribbon enough flying from the seven hats to have set up a milliner very tuneful bluebirds they were too for all the lads sang and the echo of their happy voices reached mrs jessie long before she saw them  the moment the boat hove in sight up went the island flag and the bluejackets cheered lustily as they did on every possible occasion like true young americans this welcome was answered by the flapping of a handkerchief and the shrill rah rah rah of the one small tar who stood in the stern waving his hat manfully while a maternal hand clutched him firmly in the rear  cleopatra landing from her golden galley never received a heartier greeting than little mum as she was borne to her tent by the young folk for love of whom she smilingly resigned herself to three days of discomfort while jamie immediately attached himself to rose assuring her of his protection from the manifold perils which might assail them  taught by long experience that boys are always hungry aunt jessie soon proposed supper and proceeded to get it enveloped in an immense apron with an old hat of archies stuck atop of her cap rose helped and tried to be as handy as phebe though the peculiar style of table she had to set made it no easy task it was accomplished at last and a very happy party lay about under the trees eating and drinking out of anyones plate and cup and quite untroubled by the frequent appearance of ants and spiders in places which these interesting insects are not expected to adorn  i never thought i should like to wash dishes but i do said rose as she sat in a boat after supper lazily rinsing plates in the sea and rocking luxuriously as she wiped them  mum is mighty particular we just give em a scrub with sand and dust em off with a bit of paper its much the best way i think replied geordie who reposed in another boat alongside  how phebe would like this i wonder uncle did not have her come  i believe he tried to but dolly was as cross as two sticks and said she couldnt spare her im sorry for we all like the phebe bird and shed chirp like a good one out here wouldnt she  she ought to have a holiday like the rest of us its too bad to leave her out  this thought came back to rose several times that evening for phebe would have added much to the little concert they had in the moonlight would have enjoyed the stories told been quick at guessing the conundrums and laughed with all her heart at the fun the merry going to bed would have been the best of all for rose wanted someone to cuddle under the blue blanket with her there to whisper and giggle and tell secrets as girls delight to do  long after the rest were asleep rose lay wide awake excited by the novelty of all about her and a thought that had come into her mind far away she heard a city clock strike twelve a large star like a mild eye peeped in at the opening of the tent and the soft plash of the waves seemed calling her to come out aunt jessie lay fast asleep with jamie rolled up like a kitten at her feet and neither stirred as rose in her wrapper crept out to see how the world looked at midnight  she found it very lovely and sat down on a cracker keg to enjoy it with a heart full of the innocent sentiment of her years fortunately dr alec saw her before she had time to catch cold for coming out to tie back the doorflap of his tent for more air he beheld the small figure perched in the moonlight having no fear of ghosts he quietly approached and seeing that she was wide awake said with a hand on her shining hair  what is my girl doing here  having a good time answered rose not at all startled  i wonder what she was thinking about with such a sober look  the story you told of the brave sailor who gave up his place on the raft to the woman and the last drop of water to the poor baby people who make sacrifices are very much loved and admired arent they she asked earnestly  if the sacrifice is a true one but many of the bravest never are known and get no praise that does not lessen their beauty though perhaps it makes them harder for we all like sympathy and dr alec sighed a patient sort of sigh  i suppose you have made a great many would you mind telling me one of them asked rose arrested by the sigh  my last was to give up smoking was the very unromantic answer to her pensive question  why did you  bad example for the boys  that was very good of you uncle was it hard  im ashamed to say it was but as a wise old fellow once said it is necessary to do right it is not necessary to be happy  rose pondered over the saying as if it pleased her and then said with a clear bright look  a real sacrifice is giving up something you want or enjoy very much isnt it  yes  doing it ones own self because one loves another person very much and wants her to be happy  yes  and doing it pleasantly and being glad about it and not minding the praise if it doesnt come  yes dear that is the true spirit of selfsacrifice you seem to understand it and i dare say you will have many chances in your life to try the real thing i hope they wont be very hard ones  i think they will began rose and there stopped short  well make one now and go to sleep or my girl will be ill tomorrow and then the aunts will say camping out was bad for her  ill go good night and throwing him a kiss the little ghost vanished leaving uncle alec to pace the shore and think about some of the unsuspected sacrifices that had made him what he was    chapter 10 roses sacrifice  there certainly were larks on campbells island next day as charlie had foretold and rose took her part in them like one intent on enjoying every minute to the utmost there was a merry breakfast a successful fishing expedition and then the lobsters came out in full force for even aunt jessie appeared in red flannel there was nothing uncle alec could not do in the water and the boys tried their best to equal him in strength and skill so there was a great diving and ducking for every one was bent on distinguishing himself  rose swam out far beyond her depth with uncle to float her back aunt jessie splashed placidly in the shallow pools with jamie paddling near by like a little whale beside its mother while the lads careered about looking like a flock of distracted flamingoes and acting like the famous dancing party in alices adventures in wonderland  nothing but chowder would have lured them from their gambols in the briny deep that timehonoured dish demanded the concentrated action of several mighty minds so the water babies came ashore and fell to cooking  it is unnecessary to say that when done it was the most remarkable chowder ever cooked and the quantity eaten would have amazed the world if the secret had been divulged after this exertion a siesta was considered the thing and people lay about in tents or out as they pleased the boys looking like warriors slumbering where they fell  the elders had just settled to a comfortable nap when the youngsters rose refreshed and ready for further exploits a hint sent them all off to the cave and there were discovered bows and arrows battle clubs old swords and various relics of an interesting nature perched upon a commanding rock with jamie to splain things to her rose beheld a series of stirring scenes enacted with great vigour and historical accuracy by her gifted relatives  captain cook was murdered by the natives of owhyhee in the most thrilling manner captain kidd buried untold wealth in the chowder kettle at the dead of night and shot both the trusting villains who shared the secret of the hiding place sinbad came ashore there and had manifold adventures and numberless wrecks bestrewed the sands  rose considered them by far the most exciting dramas she had ever witnessed and when the performance closed with a grand ballet of feejee islanders whose barbaric yells alarmed the gulls she had no words in which to express her gratification  another swim at sunset another merry evening on the rocks watching the lighted steamers pass seaward and the pleasureboats come into port ended the second day of the camping out and sent everyone to bed early that they might be ready for the festivities of the morrow  archie didnt i hear uncle ask you to row home in the morning for fresh milk and things  yes why  please may i go too i have something of great importance to arrange you know i was carried off in a hurry rose said in a confidential whisper as she was bidding her cousins good night  im willing and i guess charlie wont mind  thank you be sure you stand by me when i ask leave in the morning and dont say anything till then except to charlie promise urged rose so eagerly that archie struck an attitude and cried dramatically  by yonder moon i swear  hush its all right go along and rose departed as if satisfied  shes a queer little thing isnt she prince  rather a nice little thing i think im quite fond of her  roses quick ears caught both remarks and she retired to her tent saying to herself with sleepy dignity  little thing indeed those boys talk as if i was a baby they will treat me with more respect after tomorrow i guess  archie did stand by her in the morning and her request was readily granted as the lads were coming directly back off they went and rose waved her hand to the islanders with a somewhat pensive air for an heroic purpose glowed within her and the spirit of selfsacrifice was about to be illustrated in a new and touching manner  while the boys got the milk rose ran to phebe ordered her to leave her dishes to put on her hat and take a note back to uncle alec which would explain this somewhat mysterious performance phebe obeyed and when she went to the boat rose accompanied her telling the boys she was not ready to go yet but they could some of them come for her when she hung a white signal on her balcony  but why not come now what are you about miss uncle wont like it  protested charlie in great amazement  just do as i tell you little boy uncle will understand and explain obey as phebe does and ask no questions i can have secrets as well as other people and rose walked off with an air of lofty independence that impressed her friends immensely  its some plot between uncle and herself so we wont meddle all right phebe pull away prince and off they went to be received with much surprise by the islanders  this was the note phebe bore   dear uncle i am going to take phebes place today and let her have all the fun she can please dont mind what she says but keep her and tell the boys to be very good to her for my sake dont think it is easy to do this it is very hard to give up the best day of all but i feel so selfish to have all the pleasure and phebe none that i wish to make this sacrifice do let me and dont laugh at it i truly do not wish to be praised and i truly want to do it love to all from  rose  bless the little dear what a generous heart she has shall we go after her jessie or let her have her way said dr alec after the first mingled amusement and astonishment had subsided  let her alone and dont spoil her little sacrifice she means it i know and the best way in which we can show our respect for her effort is to give phebe a pleasant day im sure she has earned it and mrs jessie made a sign to the boys to suppress their disappointment and exert themselves to please roses guest  phebe was with difficulty kept from going straight home and declared that she should not enjoy herself one bit without miss rose  she wont hold out all day and we shall see her paddling back before noon ill wager anything said charlie and the rest so strongly inclined to his opinion that they resigned themselves to the loss of the little queen of the revels sure that it would be only a temporary one  but hour after hour passed and no signal appeared on the balcony though phebe watched it hopefully no passing boat brought the truant back though more than one pair of eyes looked out for the bright hair under the round hat and sunset came bringing no rose but the lovely colour in the western sky  i really did not think the child had it in her i fancied it was a bit of sentiment but i see she was in earnest and means that her sacrifice shall be a true one dear little soul ill make it up to her a thousand times over and beg her pardon for thinking it might be done for effect dr alec said remorsefully as he strained his eyes through the dusk fancying he saw a small figure sitting in the garden as it had sat on the keg the night before laying the generous little plot that had cost more than he could guess  well she cant help seeing the fireworks any way unless she is goose enough to think she must hide in a dark closet and not look said archie who was rather disgusted at roses seeming ingratitude  she will see ours capitally but miss the big ones on the hill unless papa has forgotten all about them added steve cutting short the harangue mac had begun upon the festivals of the ancients  im sure the sight of her will be better than the finest fireworks that ever went off said phebe meditating an elopement with one of the boats if she could get a chance  let things work if she resists a brilliant invitation we give her she will be a heroine added uncle alec secretly hoping that she would not  meanwhile rose had spent a quiet busy day helping dolly waiting on aunt peace and steadily resisting aunt plentys attempts to send her back to the happy island it had been hard in the morning to come in from the bright world outside with flags flying cannon booming crackers popping and everyone making ready for a holiday and go to washing cups while dolly grumbled and the aunts lamented it was very hard to see the day go by knowing how gay each hour must have been across the water and how a word from her would take her where she longed to be with all her heart but it was hardest of all when evening came and aunt peace was asleep aunt plenty seeing a gossip in the parlor dolly established in the porch to enjoy the show and nothing left for the little maid to do but sit alone in her balcony and watch the gay rockets whizz up from island hill and city while bands played and boats laden with happy people went to and fro in the fitful light  then it must be confessed that a tear or two dimmed the blue eyes and once when a very brilliant display illuminated the island for a moment and she fancied she saw the tents the curly head went down on the railing and a wideawake nasturtium heard a little whisper  i hope someone wishes i was there  the tears were all gone however and she was watching the hill and island answer each other with what jamie called whizzers whirligigs and busters and smiling as she thought how hard the boys must be working to keep up such a steady fire when uncle mac came walking in upon her saying hurriedly  come child put on your tippet pelisse or whatever you call it and run off with me i came to get phebe but aunt says she is gone so i want you ive got fun down in the boat and i want you to go with us and see my fireworks got them up for you and you mustnt miss them or i shall be disappointed  but uncle began rose feeling as if she ought to refuse even a glimpse of bliss perhaps   i know my dear i know aunt told me but no one needs you now so much as i do and i insist on your coming said uncle mac who seemed in a great hurry to be off yet was unusually kind  so rose went and found the little chinaman with a funny lantern waiting to help her in and convulse her with laughter trying to express his emotions in pigeon english the city clocks were striking nine as they got out into the bay and the island fireworks seemed to be over for no rocket answered the last roman candle that shone on the aunthill  ours are done i see but they are going up all round the city and how pretty they are said rose folding her mantle about her and surveying the scene with pensive interest  hope my fellows have not got into trouble up there muttered uncle mac adding with a satisfied chuckle as a spark shone out no there it goes look rosy and see how you like this one it was ordered especially in honour of your coming  rose looked with all her eyes and saw the spark grow into the likeness of a golden vase then green leaves came out and then a crimson flower glowing on the darkness with a splendid lustre  is it a rose uncle she asked clasping her hands with delight as she recognised the handsome flower  of course it is look again and guess what those are answered uncle mac chuckling and enjoying it all like a boy  a wreath of what looked at first like purple brooms appeared below the vase but rose guessed what they were meant for and stood straight up holding by his shoulder and crying excitedly  thistles uncle scotch thistles there are seven of them one for each boy oh what a joke and she laughed so that she plumped into the bottom of the boat and stayed there till the brilliant spectacle was quite gone  that was rather a neat thing i flatter myself said uncle mac in high glee at the success of his illumination now shall i leave you on the island or take you home again my good little girl he added lifting her up with such a tone of approbation in his voice that rose kissed him on the spot  home please uncle and i thank you very very much for the beautiful firework you got up for me im so glad i saw it and i know i shall dream about it answered rose steadily though a wistful glance went toward the island now so near that she could smell powder and see shadowy figures flitting about  home they went and rose fell asleep saying to herself it was harder than i thought but im glad i did it and i truly dont want any reward but phebes pleasure    chapter 11 poor mac  roses sacrifice was a failure in one respect for though the elders loved her the better for it and showed that they did the boys were not inspired with the sudden respect which she had hoped for in fact her feelings were much hurt by overhearing archie say that he couldnt see any sense in it and the prince added another blow by pronouncing her the queerest chicken ever seen  it is apt to be so and it is hard to bear for though we do not want trumpets blown we do like to have our little virtues appreciated and cannot help feeling disappointed if they are not  a time soon came however when rose quite unconsciously won not only the respect of her cousins but their gratitude and affection likewise  soon after the island episode mac had a sunstroke and was very ill for some time it was so sudden that everyone was startled and for some days the boys life was in danger he pulled through however and then just as the family were rejoicing a new trouble appeared which cast a gloom over them all  poor macs eyes gave out and well they might for he had abused them and never being very strong they suffered doubly now  no one dared to tell him the dark predictions of the great oculist who came to look at them and the boy tried to be patient thinking that a few weeks of rest would repair the overwork of several years  he was forbidden to look at a book and as that was the one thing he most delighted in it was a terrible affliction to the worm everyone was very ready to read to him and at first the lads contended for this honour but as week after week went by and mac was still condemned to idleness and a darkened room their zeal abated and one after the other fell off it was hard for the active fellows right in the midst of their vacation and nobody blamed them when they contented themselves with brief calls running of errands and warm expressions of sympathy  the elders did their best but uncle mac was a busy man aunt janes reading was of a funereal sort impossible to listen to long and the other aunties were all absorbed in their own cares though they supplied the boy with every delicacy they could invent  uncle alec was a host in himself but he could not give all his time to the invalid and if it had not been for rose the afflicted worm would have fared ill her pleasant voice suited him her patience was unfailing her time of no apparent value and her eager goodwill was very comforting  the womanly power of selfdevotion was strong in the child and she remained faithfully at her post when all the rest dropped away hour after hour she sat in the dusky room with one ray of light on her book reading to the boy who lay with shaded eyes silently enjoying the only pleasure that lightened the weary days sometimes he was peevish and hard to please sometimes he growled because his reader could not manage the dry books he wished to hear and sometimes he was so despondent that her heart ached to see him through all these trials rose persevered using all her little arts to please him when he fretted she was patient when he growled she ploughed bravely through the hard pages not dry to her in one sense for quiet tears dropped on them now and then and when mac fell into a despairing mood she comforted him with every hopeful word she dared to offer  he said little but she knew he was grateful for she suited him better than anyone else if she was late he was impatient when she had to go he seemed forlorn and when the tired head ached worst she could always soothe him to sleep crooning the old songs her father used to love  i dont know what i should do without that child aunt jane often said  shes worth all those racketing fellows put together mac would add fumbling about to discover if the little chair was ready for her coming  that was the sort of reward rose liked the thanks that cheered her and whenever she grew very tired one look at the green shade the curly head so restless on the pillow and the poor groping hands touched her tender heart and put new spirit into the weary voice  she did not know how much she was learning both from the books she read and the daily sacrifices she made stories and poetry were her delight but mac did not care for them and since his favourite greeks and romans were forbidden he satisfied himself with travels biographies and the history of great inventions or discoveries rose despised this taste at first but soon got interested in livingstones adventures hobsons stirring life in india and the brave trials and triumphs of watt and arkwright fulton and palissy the potter the true strong books helped the dreamy girl her faithful service and sweet patience touched and won the boy and long afterward both learned to see how useful those seemingly hard and weary hours had been to them  one bright morning as rose sat down to begin a fat volume entitled history of the french revolution expecting to come to great grief over the long names mac who was lumbering about the room like a blind bear stopped her by asking abruptly  what day of the month is it  the seventh of august i believe  more than half my vacation gone and ive only had a week of it i call that hard and he groaned dismally  so it is but there is more to come and you may be able to enjoy that  may be able i will be able does that old noodle think im going to stay stived up here much longer  i guess he does unless your eyes get on faster than they have yet  has he said anything more lately  i havent seen him you know shall i begin this looks rather nice  read away its all one to me and mac cast himself down upon the old lounge where his heavy head felt easiest  rose began with great spirit and kept on gallantly for a couple of chapters getting over the unpronounceable names with unexpected success she thought for her listener did not correct her once and lay so still she fancied he was deeply interested all of a sudden she was arrested in the middle of a fine paragraph by mac who sat bolt upright brought both feet down with a thump and said in a rough excited tone  stop i dont hear a word and you may as well save your breath to answer my question  what is it asked rose looking uneasy for she had something on her mind and feared that he suspected what it was his next words proved that she was right  now look here i want to know something and youve got to tell me  please dont  began rose beseechingly  you must or ill pull off this shade and stare at the sun as hard as ever i can stare come now and he half rose as if ready to execute the threat  i will oh i will tell if i know but dont be reckless and do anything so crazy as that cried rose in great distress  very well then listen and dont dodge as everyone else does didnt the doctor think my eyes worse the last time he came mother wont say but you shall  i believe he did faltered rose  i thought so did he say i should be able to go to school when it begins  no mac very low  ah  that was all but rose saw her cousin set his lips together and take a long breath as if she had hit him hard he bore the disappointment bravely however and asked quite steadily in a minute  how soon does he think i can study again  it was so hard to answer that yet rose knew she must for aunt jane had declared she could not do it and uncle mac had begged her to break the truth to the poor lad  not for a good many months  how many he asked with a pathetic sort of gruffness  a year perhaps  a whole year why i expected to be ready for college by that time  and pushing up the shade mac stared at her with startled eyes that soon blinked and fell before the one ray of light  plenty of time for that you must be patient now and get them thoroughly well or they will trouble you again when it will be harder to spare them she said with tears in her own eyes  i wont do it i will study and get through somehow its all humbug about taking care so long these doctors like to keep hold of a fellow if they can but i wont stand it i vow i wont and he banged his fist down on the unoffending pillow as if he were pommelling the hardhearted doctor  now mac listen to me rose said very earnestly though her voice shook a little and her heart ached you know you have hurt your eyes reading by firelight and in the dusk and sitting up late and now youll have to pay for it the doctor said so you must be careful and do as he tells you or you will be blind  no  yes it is true and he wanted us to tell you that nothing but entire rest would cure you i know its dreadfully hard but well all help you ill read all day long and lead you and wait upon you and try to make it easier  she stopped there for it was evident that he did not hear a sound the word blind seemed to have knocked him down for he had buried his face in the pillow and lay so still that rose was frightened she sat motionless for many minutes longing to comfort him but not knowing how and wishing uncle alec would come for he had promised to tell mac  presently a sort of choking sound came out of the pillow and went straight to her heart the most pathetic sob she ever heard for though it was the most natural means of relief the poor fellow must not indulge in it because of the afflicted eyes the french revolution  tumbled out of her lap and running to the sofa she knelt down by it saying with the motherly sort of tenderness girls feel for any sorrowing creature  oh my dear you mustnt cry it is so bad for your poor eyes take your head out of that hot pillow and let me cool it i dont wonder you feel so but please dont cry ill cry for you it wont hurt me  as she spoke she pulled away the cushion with gentle force and saw the green shade all crushed and stained with the few hot tears that told how bitter the disappointment had been mac felt her sympathy but being a boy did not thank her for it only sat up with a jerk saying as he tried to rub away the telltale drops with the sleeve of his jacket dont bother weak eyes always water im all right  but rose cried out and caught his arm dont touch them with that rough woollen stuff lie down and let me bathe them theres a dear boy then there will be no harm done  they do smart confoundedly i say dont you tell the other fellows that i made a baby of myself will you he added yielding with a sigh to the orders of his nurse who had flown for the eyewash and linen cambric handkerchief  of course i wont but anyone would be upset at the idea of being well troubled in this way im sure you bear it splendidly and you know it isnt half so bad when you get used to it besides it is only for a time and you can do lots of pleasant things if you cant study youll have to wear blue goggles perhaps wont that be funny  and while she was pouring out all the comfortable words she could think of rose was softly bathing the eyes and dabbing the hot forehead with lavenderwater as her patient lay quiet with a look on his face that grieved her sadly  homer was blind and so was milton and they did something to be remembered by in spite of it he said as if to himself in a solemn tone for even the blue goggles did not bring a smile  papa had a picture of milton and his daughters writing for him it was a very sweet picture i thought observed rose in a serious voice trying to meet the sufferer on his own ground  perhaps i could study if someone read and did the eye part do you suppose i could by and by he asked with a sudden ray of hope  i dare say if your head is strong enough this sunstroke you know is what upset you and your brain needs rest the doctor says  ill have a talk with the old fellow next time he comes and find out just what i may do then i shall know where i am what a fool i was that day to be stewing my brains and letting the sun glare on my book till the letters danced before me i see em now when i shut my eyes black balls bobbing round and stars and all sorts of queer things wonder if all blind people do  dont think about them ill go on reading shall i we shall come to the exciting part soon and then youll forget all this suggested rose  no i never shall forget hang the old revolution i dont want to hear another word of it my head aches and im hot oh wouldnt i like to go for a pull in the stormy petrel and poor mac tossed about as if he did not know what to do with himself  let me sing and perhaps youll drop off then the day will seem shorter said rose taking up a fan and sitting down beside him  perhaps i shall i didnt sleep much last night and when i did i dreamed like fun see here you tell the people that i know and its all right and i dont want them to talk about it or howl over me thats all now drone away and ill try to sleep wish i could for a year and wake up cured  oh i wish i wish you could  rose said it so fervently that mac was moved to grope for her apron and hold on to a corner of it as if it was comfortable to feel her near him but all he said was  you are a good little soul rosy give us the birks that is a drowsy one that always sends me off  quite contented with this small return for all her sympathy rose waved her fan and sang in a dreamy tone the pretty scotch air the burden of which is      bonny lassie will ye gang will ye gang      to the birks of aberfeldie  whether the lassie went or not i cannot say but the laddie was off to the land of nod in about ten minutes quite worn out with hearing the bad tidings and the effort to bear them manfully    chapter 12 the other fellows  rose did tell the people what had passed and no one howled over mac or said a word to trouble him he had his talk with the doctor and got very little comfort out of it for he found that just what he might do was nothing at all though the prospect of some study by and by if all went well gave him courage to bear the woes of the present having made up his mind to this he behaved so well that everyone was astonished never having suspected so much manliness in the quiet worm  the boys were much impressed both by the greatness of the affliction which hung over him and by his way of bearing it they were very good to him but not always particularly wise in their attempts to cheer and amuse and rose often found him much downcast after a visit of condolence from the clan she still kept her place as headnurse and chiefreader though the boys did their best in an irregular sort of way they were rather taken aback sometimes at finding roses services preferred to theirs and privately confided to one another that old mac was getting fond of being mollycoddled but they could not help seeing how useful she was and owning that she alone had remained faithful a fact which caused some of them much secret compunction now and then  rose felt that she ruled in that room if nowhere else for aunt jane left a great deal to her finding that her experience with her invalid father fitted her for a nurse and in a case like this her youth was an advantage rather than a drawback mac soon came to think that no one could take care of him so well as rose and rose soon grew fond of her patient though at first she had considered this cousin the least attractive of the seven he was not polite and sensible like archie nor gay and handsome like prince charlie nor neat and obliging like steve nor amusing like the brats nor confiding and affectionate like little jamie he was rough absentminded careless and awkward rather priggish and not at all agreeable to a dainty beautyloving girl like rose  but when his trouble came upon him she discovered many good things in this cousin of hers and learned not only to pity but to respect and love the poor worm who tried to be patient brave and cheerful and found it a harder task than anyone guessed except the little nurse who saw him in his gloomiest moods she soon came to think that his friends did not appreciate him and upon one occasion was moved to free her mind in a way that made a deep impression on the boys  vacation was almost over and the time drawing near when mac would be left outside the happy schoolworld which he so much enjoyed this made him rather low in his mind and his cousins exerted themselves to cheer him up especially one afternoon when a spasm of devotion seemed to seize them all jamie trudged down the hill with a basket of blackberries which he had picked all his ownself as his scratched fingers and stained lips plainly testified will and geordie brought their puppies to beguile the weary hours and the three elder lads called to discuss baseball cricket and kindred subjects eminently fitted to remind the invalid of his privations  rose had gone to drive with uncle alec who declared she was getting as pale as a potato sprout living so much in a dark room but her thoughts were with her boy all the while and she ran up to him the moment she returned to find things in a fine state of confusion  with the best intentions in life the lads had done more harm than good and the spectacle that met nurse roses eye was a trying one the puppies were yelping the small boys romping and the big boys all talking at once the curtains were up the room close berries scattered freely about macs shade half off his cheeks flushed his temper ruffled and his voice loudest of all as he disputed hotly with steve about lending certain treasured books which he could no longer use  now rose considered this her special kingdom and came down upon the invaders with an energy which amazed them and quelled the riot at once they had never seen her roused before and the effect was tremendous also comical for she drove the whole flock of boys out of the room like an indignant little hen defending her brood they all went as meekly as sheep the small lads fled from the house precipitately but the three elder ones only retired to the next room and remained there hoping for a chance to explain and apologise and so appease the irate young lady who had suddenly turned the tables and clattered them about their ears  as they waited they observed her proceedings through the halfopen door and commented upon them briefly but expressively feeling quite bowed down with remorse at the harm they had innocently done  shes put the room to rights in a jiffey what jacks we were to let those dogs in and kick up such a row observed steve after a prolonged peep  the poor old worm turns as if she was treading on him instead of cuddling him like a pussy cat isnt he cross though added charlie as mac was heard growling about his confounded head  she will manage him but its mean in us to rumple him up and then leave her to smooth him down id go and help but i dont know how  said archie looking much depressed for he was a conscientious fellow and blamed himself for his want of thought  no more do i odd isnt it what a knack women have for taking care of sick folks and charlie fell amusing over this undeniable fact  she has been ever so good to mac began steve in a selfreproachful tone  better than his own brother hey cut in archie finding relief for his own regret in the delinquencies of another  well you neednt preach you didnt any of you do any more and you might have for mac likes you better than he does me i always fret him he says and it isnt my fault if i am a quiddle protested steve in selfdefence  we have all been selfish and neglected him so we wont fight about it but try and do better said archie generously taking more than his share of blame for he had been less inattentive than either of the others  rose has stood by him like a good one and its no wonder he likes to have her round best i should myself if i was down on my luck as he is  put in charlie feeling that he really had not done the little thing  justice  ill tell you what it is boys we havent been half good enough to rose and weve got to make it up to her somehow said archie who had a very manly sense of honour about paying his debts even to a girl  im awfully sorry i made fun of her doll when jamie lugged it out and i called her baby bunting when she cried over the dead kitten girls are such geese sometimes i cant help it said steve confessing his transgressions handsomely and feeling quite ready to atone for them if he only knew how  ill go down on my knees and beg her pardon for treating her as if she was a child dont it make her mad though come to think of it shes only two years or so younger than i am but she is so small and pretty she always seems like a dolly to me and the prince looked down from his lofty height of five feet five as if rose was indeed a pygmy beside him  that dolly has got a real good little heart and a bright mind of her own youd better believe mac says she understands some things quicker than he can and mother thinks she is an uncommonly nice girl though she dont know all creation you neednt put on airs charlie though you are a tall one for rose likes archie better than you she said she did because he treated her respectfully  steve looks as fierce as a gamecock but dont you get excited my son for it wont do a bit of good of course everybody likes the chief best they ought to and ill punch their heads if they dont so calm yourself dandy and mend your own manners before you come down on other peoples  thus the prince with great dignity and perfect good nature while archie looked modestly gratified with the flattering opinions of his kinsfolk and steve subsided feeling he had done his duty as a cousin and a brother a pause ensued during which aunt jane appeared in the other room accompanied by a teatray sumptuously spread and prepared to feed her big nestling as that was a task she allowed no one to share with her  if you have a minute to spare before you go child i wish youd just make mac a fresh shade this has got a berry stain on it and he must be tidy for he is to go out tomorrow if it is a cloudy day said mrs jane spreading toast in a stately manner while mac slopped his tea about without receiving a word of reproof  yes aunt answered rose so meekly that the boys could hardly believe it could be the same voice which had issued the stern command out of this room every one of you not very long ago  they had not time to retire without unseemly haste before she walked into the parlour and sat down at the worktable without a word it was funny to see the look the three tall lads cast at the little person sedately threading a needle with green silk they all wanted to say something expressive of repentance but no one knew how to begin and it was evident from the prim expression of roses face that she intended to stand upon her dignity till they had properly abased themselves the pause was becoming very awkward when charlie who possessed all the persuasive arts of a born scapegrace went slowly down upon his knees before her beat his breast and said in a heartbroken tone  please forgive me this time and ill never do so any more  it was very hard to keep sober but rose managed it and answered gravely  it is macs pardon you should ask not mine for you havent hurt me and i shouldnt wonder if you had him a great deal with all that light and racket and talk about things that only worry him  do you really think weve hurt him cousin asked archie with a troubled look while charlie settled down in a remorseful heap among the table legs  yes i do for he has got a raging headache and his eyes are as red as as this emery bag answered rose solemnly plunging her needle into a fat flannel strawberry  steve tore his hair metaphorically speaking for he clutched his cherished topknot and wildly dishevelled it as if that was the heaviest penance he could inflict upon himself at such short notice charlie laid himself out flat melodramatically begging someone to take him away and hang him but archie who felt worst of all said nothing except to vow within himself that he would read to mac till his own eyes were as red as a dozen emery bags combined  seeing the wholesome effects of her treatment upon these culprits rose felt that she might relent and allow them a gleam of hope she found it impossible to help trampling upon the prostrate prince a little in words at least for he had hurt her feelings oftener than he knew so she gave him a thimblepie on the top of his head and said with an air of an infinitely superior being  dont be silly but get up and ill tell you something much better to do than sprawling on the floor and getting all over lint  charlie obediently sat himself upon a hassock at her feet the other sinners drew near to catch the words of wisdom about to fall from her lips and rose softened by this gratifying humility addressed them in her most maternal tone  now boys if you really want to be good to mac you can do it in this way dont keep talking about things he cant do or go and tell what fun you have had batting your ridiculous balls about get some nice book and read quietly cheer him up about school and offer to help him study by and by you can do that better than i because im only a girl and dont learn greek and latin and all sorts of headachy stuff  yes but you can do heaps of things better than we can youve proved that said archie with an approving look that delighted rose though she could not resist giving charlie one more rebuke by saying with a little bridling of the head and a curl of the lip that wanted to smile instead  im glad you think so though i am a queer chicken  this scathing remark caused the prince to hide his face for shame and steve to erect his head in the proud consciousness that this shot was not meant for him archie laughed and rose seeing a merry blue eye winking at her from behind two brown hands gave charlies ear a friendly tweak and extended the olivebranch of peace  now well all be good and plan nice things for poor mac she said smiling so graciously that the boys felt as if the sun had suddenly burst out from behind a heavy cloud and was shining with great brilliancy  the storm had cleared the air and quite a heavenly calm succeeded during which plans of a most varied and surprising sort were laid for everyone burned to make noble sacrifices upon the shrine of poor mac and rose was the guiding star to whom the others looked with most gratifying submission of course this elevated state of things could not endure long but it was very nice while it lasted and left an excellent effect upon the minds of all when the first ardour had subsided  there thats ready for tomorrow and i do hope it will be cloudy  said rose as she finished off the new shade the progress of which the boys had watched with interest  id bespoken an extra sunny day but ill tell the clerk of the weather to change it hes an obliging fellow and hell attend to it so make yourself easy said charlie who had become quite perky again  it is very easy for you to joke but how would you like to wear a blinder like that for weeks and weeks sir and rose quenched his rising spirits by slipping the shade over his eyes as he still sat on the cushion at her feet  its horrid take it off take it off i dont wonder the poor old boy has the blues with a thing like that on and charlie sat looking at what seemed to him an instrument of torture with such a sober face that rose took it gently away and went in to bid mac goodnight  i shall go home with her for it is getting darkish and she is rather timid said archie forgetting that he had often laughed at this very timidity  i think i might for shes taking care of my brother put in steve asserting his rights  lets all go that will please her proposed charlie with a burst of gallantry which electrified his mates  we will they said with one voice and they did to roses great surprise and secret contentment though archie had all the care of her for the other two were leaping fences running races and having wrestling matches all the way down  they composed themselves on reaching the door however shook hands cordially all round made their best bows and retired with great elegance and dignity leaving rose to say to herself with girlish satisfaction as she went in  now that is the way i like to be treated    chapter 13 cosey corner  vacation was over the boys went back to school and poor mac was left lamenting he was out of the darkened room now and promoted to blue goggles through which he took a gloomy view of life as might have been expected for there was nothing he could do but wander about and try to amuse himself without using his eyes anyone who has ever been condemned to that sort of idleness knows how irksome it is and can understand the state of mind which caused mac to say to rose in a desperate tone one day  look here if you dont invent some new employment or amusement for me i shall knock myself on the head as sure as you live  rose flew to uncle alec for advice and he ordered both patient and nurse to the mountains for a month with aunt jessie and jamie as escort pokey and her mother joined the party and one bright september morning six very happylooking people were aboard the express train for portland two smiling mammas laden with luncheon baskets and wraps a pretty young girl with a bag of books on her arm a tall thin lad with his hat over his eyes and two small children who sat with their short legs straight out before them and their chubby faces beaming with the first speechless delight of truly travelling  an especially splendid sunset seemed to have been prepared to welcome them when after a long days journey they drove into a wide green dooryard where a white colt a red cow two cats four kittens many hens and a dozen people old and young were gaily disporting themselves everyone nodded and smiled in the friendliest manner and a lively old lady kissed the newcomers all round as she said heartily  well now im proper glad to see you come right in and rest and well have tea in less than no time for you must be tired lizzie you show the folks upstairs kitty you fly round and help father in with the trunks and jenny and i will have the table all ready by the time you come down bless the dears they want to go see the pussies and so they shall  the three pretty daughters did fly round and everyone felt at home at once all were so hospitable and kind aunt jessie had raptures over the homemade carpets quilts and quaint furniture rose could not keep away from the windows for each framed a lovely picture and the little folks made friends at once with the other children who filled their arms with chickens and kittens and did the honours handsomely  the toot of a horn called all to supper and a goodly party including six children besides the campbells assembled in the long diningroom armed with mountain appetites and the gayest spirits it was impossible for anyone to be shy or sober for such gales of merriment arose they blew the starch out of the stiffest and made the saddest jolly mother atkinson as all called their hostess was the merriest there and the busiest for she kept flying up to wait on the children to bring out some new dish or to banish the live stock who were of such a social turn that the colt came into the entry and demanded sugar the cats sat about in peoples laps winking suggestively at the food and speckled hens cleared the kitchen floor of crumbs as they joined in the chat with a cheerful clucking  everybody turned out after tea to watch the sunset till all the lovely red was gone and mosquitoes wound their shrill horns to sound the retreat the music of an organ surprised the newcomers and in the parlor they found father atkinson playing sweetly on the little instrument made by himself all the children gathered about him and led by the tuneful sisters sang prettily till pokey fell asleep behind the door and jamie gaped audibly right in the middle of his favourite      coo said the little doves  coo said she     all in the top of the old pinetree  the older travellers being tired went to bye low at the same time and slept like tops in homespun sheets on husk mattresses made by mother atkinson who seemed to have put some soothing powder among them so deep and sweet was the slumber that came  next day began the wholesome outofdoor life which works such wonders with tired minds and feeble bodies the weather was perfect and the mountain air made the children as frisky as young lambs while the elders went about smiling at one another and saying isnt it splendid even mac the slow coach was seen to leap over a fence as if he really could not help it and when rose ran after him with his broadbrimmed hat he made the spirited proposal to go into the woods and hunt for a catamount  jamie and pokey were at once enrolled in the cosey corner light infantry a truly superb company composed entirely of officers all wearing cocked hats carrying flags waving swords or beating drums it was a spectacle to stir the dullest soul when this gallant band marched out of the yard in full regimentals with captain dove a solemn bigheaded boy of eleven issuing his orders with the gravity of a general and his falstaffian regiment obeying them with more docility than skill the little snow children did very well and lieutenant jack dove was fine to see so was drummer frank the errandboy of the house as he rubadubdubbed with all his heart and drumsticks jamie had trained  before and was made a colonel at once but pokey was the best of all and called forth a spontaneous burst of applause from the spectators as she brought up the rear her cocked hat all over one eye her flag trailing over her shoulder and her wooden sword straight up in the air her face beaming and every curl bobbing with delight as her fat legs tottered in the vain attempt to keep step manfully  mac and rose were picking blackberries in the bushes beside the road when the soldiers passed without seeing them and they witnessed a sight that was both pretty and comical a little farther on was one of the family burial spots so common in those parts and just this side of it captain fred dove ordered his company to halt explaining his reason for so doing in the following words  thats a graveyard and its proper to muffle the drums and lower the flags as we go by and wed better take off our hats too its more respectable i think  isnt that cunning of the dears whispered rose as the little troop marched slowly by to the muffled roll of the drums every flag and sword held low all the little heads uncovered and the childish faces very sober as the leafy shadows flickered over them  lets follow and see what they are after proposed mac who found sitting on the wall and being fed with blackberries luxurious but tiresome  so they followed and heard the music grow lively saw the banners wave in the breeze again when the graveyard was passed and watched the company file into the dilapidated old church that stood at the corner of three woodland roads presently the sound of singing made the outsiders quicken their steps and stealing up they peeped in at one of the broken windows  captain dove was up in the old wooden pulpit gazing solemnly down upon his company who having stacked their arms in the porch now sat in the bare pews singing a sundayschool hymn with great vigour and relish  let us pray said captain dove with as much reverence as an army chaplain and folding his hands he repeated a prayer which he thought all would know an excellent little prayer but not exactly appropriate to the morning for it was      now i lay me down to sleep  everyone joined in saying it and it was a pretty sight to see the little creatures bowing their curly heads and lisping out the words they knew so well tears came into roses eyes as she looked mac took his hat off involuntarily and then clapped it on again as if ashamed of showing any feeling  now i shall preach you a short sermon and my text is little children love one another i asked mamma to give me one and she thought that would be good so you all sit still and ill preach it you mustnt whisper marion but hear me it means that we should be good to each other and play fair and not quarrel as we did this very day about the wagon jack cant always drive and neednt be mad because i like to go with frank annette ought to be horse sometimes and not always driver and willie may as well make up his mind to let marion build her house by his for she will do it and he neednt fuss about it jamie seems to be a good boy but i shall preach to him if he isnt no pokey people dont kiss in church or put their hats on now you must all remember what i tell you because i am the captain and you should mind me  here lieutenant jack spoke right out in meeting with the rebellious remark  dont care if you are youd better mind yourself and tell how you took away my strap and kept the biggest doughnut and didnt draw fair when we had the truck  yes and you slapped frank i saw you bawled willie snow bobbing up in his pew  and you took my book away and hid it cause i wouldnt go and swing when you wanted me to added annette the oldest of the snow trio  i shant build my house by willies if he dont want me to so now  put in little marion joining the mutiny  i will tiss dimmy and i tored up my hat tause a pin picked me  shouted pokey regardless of jamies efforts to restrain her  captain dove looked rather taken aback at this outbreak in the ranks but being a dignified and calm personage he quelled the rising rebellion with great tact and skill by saying briefly  well sing the last hymn sweet sweet goodby you all know that so do it nicely and then we will go and have luncheon  peace was instantly restored and a burst of melody drowned the suppressed giggles of rose and mac who found it impossible to keep sober during the latter part of this somewhat remarkable service fifteen minutes of repose rendered it a physical impossibility for the company to march out as quietly as they had marched in i grieve to state that the entire troop raced home as hard as they could pelt and were soon skirmishing briskly over their lunch utterly oblivious of what jamie who had been much impressed by the sermon called the captains beautiful teck  it was astonishing how much they all found to do at cosey corner and mac instead of lying in a hammock and being read to as he had expected was busiest of all he was invited to survey and lay out skeeterville a town which the children were getting up in a huckleberry pasture and he found much amusement in planning little roads staking off houselots attending to the waterworks and consulting with the selectmen about the best sites for public buildings for mac was a boy still in spite of his fifteen years and his love of books  then he went fishing with a certain jovial gentleman from the west and though they seldom caught anything but colds they had great fun and exercise chasing the phantom trout they were bound to have mac also developed a geological mania and went tapping about at rocks and stones discoursing wisely of strata periods and fossil remains while rose picked up leaves and lichens and gave him lessons in botany in return for his lectures on geology  they led a very merry life for the atkinson girls kept up a sort of perpetual picnic and did it so capitally that one was never tired of it so their visitors throve finely and long before the month was out it was evident that dr alec had prescribed the right medicine for his patients    chapter 14 a happy birthday  the twelfth of october was roses birthday but no one seemed to remember that interesting fact and she felt delicate about mentioning it so fell asleep the night before wondering if she would have any presents that question was settled early the next morning for she was awakened by a soft tap on her face and opening her eyes she beheld a little black and white figure sitting on her pillow staring at her with a pair of round eyes very like blueberries while one downy paw patted her nose to attract her notice it was kitty comet the prettiest of all the pussies and comet evidently had a mission to perform for a pink bow adorned her neck and a bit of paper was pinned to it bearing the words for miss rose from frank  that pleased her extremely and that was only the beginning of the fun for surprises and presents kept popping out in the most delightful manner all through the day the atkinson girls being famous jokers and rose a favourite but the best gift of all came on the way to mount windytop where it was decided to picnic in honour of the great occasion three jolly loads set off soon after breakfast for everybody went and everybody seemed bound to have an extra good time especially mother atkinson who wore a hat as broadbrimmed as an umbrella and took the dinnerhorn to keep her flock from straying away  im going to drive auntie and a lot of the babies so you must ride the pony and please stay behind us a good bit when we go to the station for a parcel is coming and you are not to see it till dinnertime you wont mind will you said mac in a confidential aside during the wild flurry of the start  not a bit answered rose it hurts my feelings very much to be told to keep out of the way at any other time but birthdays and christmas it is part of the fun to be blind and stupid and poked into corners ill be ready as soon as you are giglamps  stop under the big maple till i call then you cant possibly see anything added mac as he mounted her on the pony his father had sent up for his use barkis was so gentle and so willin however that rose was ashamed to be afraid to ride him so she had learned that she might surprise dr alec when she got home meantime she had many a fine canter over the hills and far away with mac who preferred mr atkinsons old sorrel  away they went and coming to the red maple rose obediently paused but could not help stealing a glance in the forbidden direction before the call came yes there was a hamper going under the seat and then she caught sight of a tall man whom mac seemed to be hustling into the carriage in a great hurry one look was enough and with a cry of delight rose was off down the road as fast as barkis could go  now ill astonish uncle she thought ill dash up in grand style and show him that i am not a coward after all  fired by this ambition she startled barkis by a sharp cut and still more bewildered him by leaving him to his own guidance down the steep stony road the approach would have been a fine success if just as rose was about to pull up and salute two or three distracted hens had not scuttled across the road with a great squawking which caused barkis to shy and stop so suddenly that his careless rider landed in an ignominious heap just under old sorrels astonished nose  rose was up again before dr alec was out of the carryall and threw two dusty arms about his neck crying with a breathless voice  o uncle im so glad to see you it is better than a cartload of goodies and so dear of you to come  but arent you hurt child that was a rough tumble and im afraid you must be damaged somewhere answered the doctor full of fond anxiety as he surveyed his girl with pride  my feelings are hurt but my bones are all safe its too bad i was going to do it so nicely and those stupid hens spoilt it all said rose quite crestfallen as well as much shaken  i couldnt believe my eyes when i asked where is rose and mac pointed to the little amazon pelting down the hill at such a rate you couldnt have done anything that would please me more and im delighted to see how well you ride now will you mount again or shall we turn mac out and take you in asked dr alec as aunt jessie proposed a start for the others were beckoning them to follow  pride goeth before a fall better not try to show off again maam  said mac who would have been more than mortal if he had refrained from teasing when so good a chance offered  pride does go before a fall but i wonder if a sprained ankle always comes after it thought rose bravely concealing her pain as she answered with great dignity  i prefer to ride come on and see who will catch up first  she was up and away as she spoke doing her best to efface the memory of her downfall by sitting very erect elbows down head well up and taking the motion of the pony as barkis cantered along as easily as a rockingchair  you ought to see her go over a fence and race when we ride together she can scud too like a deer when we play follow the leader and skip stones and bat balls almost as well as i can said mac in reply to his uncles praise of his pupil  im afraid you will think her a sad tomboy alec but really she seems so well and happy i have not the heart to check her she has broken out in the most unexpected way and frisks like a colt for she says she feels so full of spirits she must run and shout whether it is proper or not added mrs jessie who had been a pretty hoyden years ago herself  good good thats the best news you could tell me and dr alec rubbed his hands heartily let the girl run and shout as much as she will it is a sure sign of health and as natural to a happy child as frisking is to any young animal full of life tomboys make strong women usually and i had far rather find rose playing football with mac than puttering over beadwork like that affected midget ariadne blish  but she cannot go on playing football very long and we must not forget that she has a womans work to do by and by began mrs jessie  neither will mac play football much longer but he will be all the better fitted for business because of the health it gives him polish is easily added if the foundations are strong but no amount of gilding will be of use if your timber is not sound im sure im right jessie and if i can do as well by my girl during the next six months as i have the last my experiment will succeed  it certainly will for when i contrast that bright blooming face with the pale listless one that made my heart ache a while ago i can believe in almost any miracle said mrs jessie as rose looked round to point out a lovely view with cheeks like the ruddy apples in the orchard near by eyes clear as the autumn sky overhead and vigour in every line of her girlish figure  a general scramble among the rocks was followed by a regular gypsy lunch which the young folks had the rapture of helping to prepare mother atkinson put on her apron turned up her sleeves and fell to work as gaily as if in her own kitchen boiling the kettle slung on three sticks over a fire of cones and fir boughs while the girls spread the mossy table with a feast of country goodies and the children tumbled about in everyones way till the toot of the horn made them settle down like a flock of hungry birds  as soon as the merry meal and a brief interval of repose were over it was unanimously voted to have some charades a smooth green spot between two stately pines was chosen for the stage shawls hung up properties collected audience and actors separated and a word quickly chosen  the first scene discovered mac in a despondent attitude and shabby dress evidently much troubled in mind to him entered a remarkable creature with a brown paper bag over its head a little pink nose peeped through one hole in the middle white teeth through another and above two eyes glared fiercely spires of grass stuck in each side of the mouth seemed meant to represent whiskers the upper corners of the bag were twisted like ears and no one could doubt for a moment that the black scarf pinned on behind was a tail  this singular animal seemed in pantomime to be comforting his master and offering advice which was finally acted upon for mac pulled off his boots helped the little beast into them and gave him a bag then kissing his paw with a hopeful gesture the creature retired purring so successfully that there was a general cry of cat puss boots  cat is the word replied a voice and the curtain fell  the next scene was a puzzler for in came another animal on allfours this time with a new sort of tail and long ears a gray shawl concealed its face but an inquisitive sunbeam betrayed the glitter as of goggles under the fringe on its back rode a small gentleman in eastern costume who appeared to find some difficulty in keeping his seat as his steed jogged along suddenly a spirit appeared all in white with long newspaper wings upon its back and golden locks about its face singularly enough the beast beheld this apparition and backed instantly but the rider evidently saw nothing and whipped up unmercifully also unsuccessfully for the spirit stood directly in the path and the amiable beast would not budge a foot a lively skirmish followed which ended in the eastern gentleman being upset into a sweetfern bush while the better bred animal abased itself before the shining one  the children were all in the dark till mother atkinson said in an inquiring tone  if that isnt balaam and the ass id like to know what it is rose makes a sweet angel doesnt she  ass was evidently the word and the angel retired smiling with mundane satisfaction over the compliment that reached her ears  the next was a pretty little scene from the immortal story of babes in the wood jamie and pokey came trotting in hand in hand and having been through the parts many times before acted with great ease and much fluency audibly directing each other from time to time as they went along the berries were picked the way lost tears shed baby consolation administered and then the little pair lay down among the brakes and died with their eyes wide open and the toes of their four little boots turned up to the daisies in the most pathetic manner  now the wobins tum you be twite dead dimmy and ill peep in and see em one defunct innocent was heard to say  i hope theyll be quick for im lying on a stone and ants are walking up my leg like fury murmured the other  here the robins came flapping in with red scarves over their breasts and leaves in their mouths which they carefully laid upon the babes wherever they would show best a prickly blackberry leaf placed directly over pokeys nose caused her to sneeze so violently that her little legs flew into the air jamie gave a startled ow and the pitying fowls fled giggling  after some discussion it was decided that the syllable must be strew or strow and then they waited to see if it was a good guess  this scene discovered annette snow in bed evidently very ill miss jenny was her anxious mamma and her merry conversation amused the audience till mac came in as a physician and made great fun with his big watch pompous manner and absurd questions he prescribed one pellet with an unpronounceable name and left after demanding twenty dollars for his brief visit  the pellet was administered and such awful agonies immediately set in that the distracted mamma bade a sympathetic neighbour run for mother knowall the neighbour ran and in came a brisk little old lady in cap and specs with a bundle of herbs under her arm which she at once applied in all sorts of funny ways explaining their virtues as she clapped a plantain poultice here put a pounded catnip plaster there or tied a couple of mullein leaves round the sufferers throat instant relief ensued the dying child sat up and demanded baked beans the grateful parent offered fifty dollars but mother knowall indignantly refused it and went smiling away declaring that a neighbourly turn needed no reward and a doctors fee was all a humbug  the audience were in fits of laughter over this scene for rose imitated mrs atkinson capitally and the herb cure was a good hit at the excellent ladys belief that yarbs would save mankind if properly applied no one enjoyed it more than herself and the saucy children prepared for the grand finale in high feather  this closing scene was brief but striking for two trains of cars whizzed in from opposite sides met with a terrible collision in the middle of the stage and a general smashup completed the word catastrophe  now let us act a proverb ive got one all ready said rose who was dying to distinguish herself in some way before uncle alec  so everyone but mac the gay westerner and rose took their places on the rocky seats and discussed the late beautiful and varied charade in which pokey frankly pronounced her own scene the bestest of all  in five minutes the curtain was lifted nothing appeared but a very large sheet of brown paper pinned to a tree and on it was drawn a clockface the hands pointing to four a small note below informed the public that 4 am was the time hardly had the audience grasped this important fact when a long waterproof serpent was seen uncoiling itself from behind a stump an inchworm perhaps would be a better description for it travelled in the same humpy way as that pleasing reptile suddenly a very wideawake and active fowl advanced pecking chirping and scratching vigorously a tuft of green leaves waved upon his crest a larger tuft of brakes made an umbrageous tail and a shawl of many colours formed his flapping wings a truly noble bird whose legs had the genuine strut whose eyes shone watchfully and whose voice had a ring that evidently struck terror into the catterpillars soul if it was a catterpillar he squirmed he wriggled he humped as fast as he could trying to escape but all in vain the tufted bird espied him gave one warbling sort of crow pounced upon him and flapped triumphantly away  that early bird got such a big worm he could hardly carry him off  laughed aunt jessie as the children shouted over the joke suggested by macs nickname  that is one of uncles favourite proverbs so i got it up for his especial benefit said rose coming up with the twolegged worm beside her  very clever what next asked dr alec as she sat down beside him  the dove boys are going to give us an incident in the life of napoleon as they call it the children think it very splendid and the little fellows do it rather nicely answered mac with condescension  a tent appeared and pacing to and fro before it was a little sentinel who in a brief soliloquy informed the observers that the elements were in a great state of confusion that he had marched some hundred miles or so that day and that he was dying for want of sleep then he paused leaned upon his gun and seemed to doze dropped slowly down overpowered with slumber and finally lay flat with his gun beside him a faithless little sentinel enter napoleon cocked hat gray coat high boots folded arms grim mouth and a melodramatic stride freddy dove always covered himself with glory in this part and took the stage  with a napoleonic attitude that brought down the house for the bigheaded boy with solemn dark eyes and square brow was the very moral of that rascal boneyparty mother atkinson said  some great scheme was evidently brewing in his mighty mind a trip across the alps a bonfire at moscow or a little skirmish at waterloo perhaps for he marched in silent majesty till suddenly a gentle snore disturbed the imperial reverie he saw the sleeping soldier and glared upon him saying in an awful tone  ha asleep at his post death is the penalty he must die  picking up the musket he is about to execute summary justice as emperors are in the habit of doing when something in the face of the weary sentinel appears to touch him and well it might for a most engaging little warrior was jack as he lay with his shako half off his childish face trying to keep sober and a great black moustache over his rosy mouth it would have softened the heart of any napoleon and the little corporal proved himself a man by relenting and saying with a lofty gesture of forgiveness  brave fellow he is worn out i will let him sleep and mount guard in his place  then shouldering the gun this noble being strode to and fro with a dignity which thrilled the younger spectators the sentinel awakes sees what has happened and gives himself up for lost but the emperor restores his weapon and with that smile which won all hearts says pointing to a high rock whereon a crow happens to be sitting be brave be vigilant and remember that from yonder pyramid generations are beholding you and with these memorable words he vanishes leaving the grateful soldier bolt upright with his hand at his temple and deathless devotion stamped upon his youthful countenance  the applause which followed this superb piece had hardly subsided when a sudden splash and a shrill cry caused a general rush toward the waterfall that went gambolling down the rocks singing sweetly as it ran pokey had tried to gambol also and had tumbled into a shallow pool whither jamie had gallantly followed in a vain attempt to fish her out and both were paddling about half frightened half pleased with the unexpected bath  this mishap made it necessary to get the dripping infants home as soon as possible so the wagons were loaded up and away they went as merry as if the mountain air had really been oxygenated sweets not bitters  as dr alec suggested when mac said he felt as jolly as if he had been drinking champagne instead of the current wine that came with a great frosted cake wreathed with sugar roses in aunt plentys hamper of goodies  rose took part in all the fun and never betrayed by look or word the twinges of pain she suffered in her ankle she excused herself from the games in the evening however and sat talking to uncle alec in a lively way that both amazed and delighted him for she confided to him that she played horse with the children drilled with the light infantry climbed trees and did other dreadful things that would have caused the aunts to cry aloud if they knew of them  i dont care a pin what they say if you dont mind uncle she answered when he pictured the dismay of the good ladies  ah its all very well to defy them but you are getting so rampant im afraid you will defy me next and then where are we  no i wont i shouldnt dare because you are my guardian and can put me in a straitjacket if you like and rose laughed in his face even while she nestled closer with a confiding gesture pleasant to see  upon my word rosy i begin to feel like the man who bought an elephant and then didnt know what to do with him i thought i had got a pet and plaything for years to come but here you are growing up like a beanstalk and i shall find ive got a strongminded little woman on my hands before i can turn round theres predicament for a man and an uncle  dr alecs comic distress was mercifully relieved for the time being by a dance of goblins on the lawn where the children with pumpkin lanterns on their heads frisked about like willothewisps as a parting surprise  when rose went to bed she found that uncle alec had not forgotten her for on the table stood a delicate little easel holding two miniatures set in velvet she knew them both and stood looking at them till her eyes brimmed over with tears that were both sweet and sad for they were the faces of her father and mother beautifully copied from portraits fast fading away  presently she knelt down and putting her arms round the little shrine kissed one after the other saying with an earnest voice ill truly try to make them glad to see me by and by  and that was roses little prayer on the night of her fourteenth birthday  two days later the campbells went home a larger party than when they came for dr alec was escort and kitty comet was borne in state in a basket with a bottle of milk some tiny sandwiches and a dolls dish to drink out of as well as a bit of carpet to lie on in her palace car out of which she kept popping her head in the most fascinating manner  there was a great kissing and cuddling waving of handkerchiefs and last goodbyes as they went and when they had started mother atkinson came running after them to tuck in some little pies hot from the oven for the dears who might get tired of bread and butter during that long days travel  another start and another halt for the snow children came shrieking up to demand the three kittens that pokey was cooly carrying off in a travelling bag the unhappy kits were rescued half smothered and restored to their lawful owners amid dire lamentation from the little kidnapper who declared that she only tooked um cause theyd want to go wid their sister tomit  start number three and stoppage number three as frank hailed them with the luncheon basket which had been forgotten after everyone had protested that it was safely in  all went well after that and the long journey was pleasantly beguiled by pokey and pussy who played together so prettily that they were considered public benefactors  rose doesnt want to go home for she knows the aunts wont let her rampage as she did up at cosey corner said mac as they approached the old house  i cant rampage if i want to for a time at least and ill tell you why i sprained my ankle when i tumbled off of barkis and it gets worse and worse though ive done all i know to cure it and hide it so it shouldnt trouble anyone whispered rose knitting her brows with pain as she prepared to descend wishing her uncle would take her instead of her bundles  how he did it she never knew but mac had her up the steps and on the parlour sofa before she could put her foot to the ground  there you are right side up with care and mind now if your ankle bothers you and you are laid up with it i am to be your footman its only fair you know for i dont forget how good you have been to me  and mac went to call phebe so full of gratitude and goodwill that his very goggles shone    chapter 15 earrings  roses sprain proved to be a serious one owing to neglect and dr alec ordered her to lie on the sofa for a fortnight at least whereat she groaned dismally but dared not openly complain lest the boys turn upon her with some of the wise little sermons on patience which she had delivered for their benefit  it was macs turn now and honourably did he repay his debt for as school was still forbidden he had plenty of leisure and devoted most of it to rose he took many steps for her and even allowed her to teach him to knit after assuring himself that many a brave scotchman knew how to click the pricks she was obliged to take a solemn vow of secrecy however before he would consent for though he did not mind being called giglamps granny was more than his boyish soul could bear and at the approach of any of the clan his knitting vanished as if by magic which frequent chucking out of sight did not improve the stripe he was doing for roses new afghan  she was busy with this pretty work one bright october afternoon all nicely established on her sofa in the upper hall while jamie and pokey lent for her amusement were keeping house in a corner with comet and roses old doll for their childerns  presently phebe appeared with a card rose read it made a grimace then laughed and said  ill see miss blish and immediately put on her company face pulled out her locket and settled her curls  you dear thing how do you do ive been trying to call every day since you got back but i have so many engagements i really couldnt manage it till today so glad you are alone for mamma said i could sit awhile and i brought my lacework to show you for its perfectly lovely cried miss blish greeting rose with a kiss which was not very warmly returned though rose politely thanked her for coming and bid phebe roll up the easy chair  how nice to have a maid said ariadne as she settled herself with much commotion still dear you must be very lonely and feel the need of a bosom friend  i have my cousins began rose with dignity for her visitors patronising manner ruffled her temper  gracious child you dont make friends of those great boys do you mamma says she really doesnt think its proper for you to be with them so much  they are like brothers and my aunts do think its proper replied rose rather sharply for it struck her that this was none of miss blishs business  i was merely going to say i should be glad to have you for my bosom friend for hatty mason and i have had an awful quarrel and dont speak she is too mean to live so i gave her up just think she never paid back one of the caramels ive given her and never invited me to her party i could have forgiven the caramels but to be left out in that rude way was more than i could bear and i told her never to look at me again as long as she lived  you are very kind but i dont think i want a bosom friend thank you  said rose as ariadne stopped to bridle and shake her flaxen head over the delinquent hatty mason  now in her heart miss blish thought rose a stuckup puss but the other girls wanted to know her and couldnt the old house was a charming place to visit the lads were considered fine fellows and the campbells are one of our first families mamma said so ariadne concealed her vexation at roses coolness and changed the subject as fast as possible  studying french i see who is your teacher she asked flitting over the leaves of paul and virginia that lay on the table  i dont study it for i read french as well as english and uncle and i often speak it for hours he talks like a native and says i have a remarkably good accent  rose really could not help this small display of superiority for french was one of her strong points and she was vain of it though she usually managed to hide this weakness she felt that ariadne would be the better for a little crushing and could not resist the temptation to patronise in her turn  oh indeed said miss blish rather blankly for french was not her strong point by any means  i am to go abroad with uncle in a year or two and he knows how important it is to understand the languages half the girls who leave school cant speak decent french and when they go abroad they are so mortified i shall be very glad to help you if you like for of course you have no one to talk with at home  now ariadne though she looked like a wax doll had feelings within her instead of sawdust and these feelings were hurt by roses lofty tone she thought her more stuck up than ever but did not know how to bring her down yet longed to do it for she felt as if she had received a box on the ear and involuntarily put her hand up to it the touch of an earring consoled her and suggested a way of returning tit for tat in a telling manner  thank you dear i dont need any help for our teacher is from paris and of course he speaks better french than your uncle then she added with a gesture of her head that set the little bells on her ears to tingling  how do you like my new earrings papa gave them to me last week and everyone says they are lovely  rose came down from her high horse with a rapidity that was comical for ariadne had the upper hand now rose adored pretty things longed to wear them and the desire of her girlish soul was to have her ears bored only dr alec thought it foolish so she never had done it she would gladly have given all the french she could jabber for a pair of golden bells with pearltipped tongues like those ariadne wore and clasping her hands she answered in a tone that went to the hearers heart  they are too sweet for anything if uncle would only let me wear some i should be perfectly happy  i wouldnt mind what he says papa laughed at me at first but he likes them now and says i shall have diamond solitaires when i am eighteen  said ariadne quite satisfied with her shot  ive got a pair now that were mammas and a beautiful little pair of pearl and turquoise ones that i am dying to wear sighed rose  then do it ill pierce your ears and you must wear a bit of silk in them till they are well your curls will hide them nicely then some day slip in your smallest earrings and see if your uncle dont like them  i asked him if it wouldnt do my eyes good once when they were red and he only laughed people do cure weak eyes that way dont they  yes indeed and yours are sort of red let me see yes i really think you ought to do it before they get worse said ariadne peering into the large clear eye offered for inspection  does it hurt much asked rose wavering  oh dear no just a prick and a pull and its all over ive done lots of ears and know just how come push up your hair and get a big needle  i dont quite like to do it without asking uncles leave faltered rose when all was ready for the operation  did he ever forbid it demanded ariadne hovering over her prey like a vampire  no never  then do it unless you are afraid cried miss blish bent on accomplishing the deed  that last word settled the matter and closing her eyes rose said punch in the tone of one giving the fatal order fire  ariadne punched and the victim bore it in heroic silence though she turned pale and her eyes were full of tears of anguish  there now pull the bits of silk often and coldcream your ears every night and youll soon be ready for the rings said ariadne well pleased with her job for the girl who spoke french with a fine accent  lay flat upon the sofa looking as exhausted as if she had had both ears cut off  it does hurt dreadfully and i know uncle wont like it sighed rose as remorse began to gnaw promise not to tell or i shall be teased to death she added anxiously entirely forgetting the two little pitchers gifted with eyes as well as ears who had been watching the whole performance from afar  never mercy me whats that and ariadne started as a sudden sound of steps and voices came up from below  its the boys hide the needle do my ears show dont breathe a word  whispered rose scrambling about to conceal all traces of their iniquity from the sharp eyes of the clan  up they came all in good order laden with the proceeds of a nutting expedition for they always reported to rose and paid tribute to their queen in the handsomest manner  how many and how big well have a grand roasting frolic after tea wont we said rose plunging both hands into a bag of glossy brown nuts while the clan stood at ease and nodded to ariadne  that lot was picked especially for you rosy i got every one myself and they are extra whackers said mac presenting a bushel or so  you should have seen giglamps when he was after them he pitched out of the tree and would have broken his blessed old neck if arch had not caught him observed steve as he lounged gracefully in the window seat  you neednt talk dandy when you didnt know a chestnut from a beech and kept on thrashing till i told you of it retorted mac festooning himself over the back of the sofa being a privileged boy  i dont make mistakes when i thrash you old worm so youd better mind what you are about answered steve without a ray of proper respect for his elder brother  it is getting dark and i must go or mamma will be alarmed said ariadne rising in sudden haste though she hoped to be asked to remain to the nutparty  no one invited her and all the while she was putting on her things and chatting to rose the boys were telegraphing to one another the sad fact that someone ought to escort the young lady home not a boy felt heroic enough to cast himself into the breach however even polite archie shirked the duty saying to charlie as they quietly slipped into an adjoining room  im not going to do all the gallivanting let steve take that chit home and show his manners  ill be hanged if i do answered prince who disliked miss blish because she tried to be coquettish with him  then i will and to the dismay of both recreant lads dr alec walked out of the room to offer his services to the chit  he was too late however for mac obeying a look from rose had already made a victim of himself and trudged meekly away wishing the gentle ariadne at the bottom of the red sea  then i will take this lady down to tea as the other one has found a gentleman to go home with her i see the lamps are lighted below and i smell a smell which tells me that auntie has something extra nice for us tonight  as he spoke dr alec was preparing to carry rose downstairs as usual but archie and prince rushed forward begging with penitent eagerness for the honour of carrying her in an armchair rose consented fearing that her uncles keen eye would discover the fatal bits of silk so the boys crossed hands and taking a good grip of each curly pate she was borne down in state while the others followed by way of the banisters  tea was ordered earlier than usual so that jamie and his dolly could have a taste at least of the holiday fun for they were to stay till seven and be allowed twelve roasted chestnuts apiece which they were under bonds not to eat till next day  tea was despatched rapidly therefore and the party gathered round the wide hearth in the diningroom where the nuts were soon dancing gaily on hot shovels or bouncing out among the company thereby causing delightful panics among the little ones  come rosy tell us a story while we work for you cant help much and must amuse us as your share proposed mac who sat in the shade pricking nuts and who knew by experience what a capital little scheherazade his cousin was  yes we poor monkeys cant burn our paws for nothing so tell away pussy added charlie as he threw several hot nuts into her lap and shook his fingers afterwards  well i happen to have a little story with a moral to it in my mind and i will tell it though it is intended for younger children than you answered rose who was rather fond of telling instructive tales  fire away said geordie and she obeyed little thinking what a disastrous story it would prove to herself  well once upon a time a little girl went to see a young lady who was very fond of her now the young lady happened to be lame and had to have her foot bandaged up every day so she kept a basketful of bandages all nicely rolled and ready the little girl liked to play with this basket and one day when she thought no one saw her she took one of the rolls without asking leave and put it in her pocket  here pokey who had been peering lovingly down at the five warm nuts that lay at the bottom of her tiny pocket suddenly looked up and said oh in a startled tone as if the moral tale had become intensely interesting all at once  rose heard and saw the innocent betrayal of the small sinner and went on in a most impressive manner while the boys nudged one another and winked as they caught the joke  but an eye did see this naughty little girl and whose eye do you think it was  eye of dod murmured consciencestricken pokey spreading two chubby little hands before the round face which they were not half big enough to hide  rose was rather taken aback by this reply but feeling that she was producing a good effect she added seriously  yes god saw her and so did the young lady but she did not say anything she waited to see what the little girl would do about it she had been very happy before she took the bandage but when it was in her pocket she seemed troubled and pretty soon stopped playing and sat down in a corner looking very sober she thought a few minutes and then went and put back the roll very softly and her face cleared up and she was a happy child again the young lady was glad to see that and wondered what made the little girl put it back  tonscience picked her murmured a contrite voice from behind the small hands pressed tightly over pokeys red face  and why did she take it do you suppose asked rose in a schoolmarmish tone feeling that all the listeners were interested in her tale and its unexpected application  it was so nice and wound and she wanted it deffly answered the little voice  well im glad she had such a good conscience the moral is that people who steal dont enjoy what they take and are not happy till they put it back what makes that little girl hide her face asked rose as she concluded  mes so shamed of pokey sobbed the small culprit quite overcome by remorse and confusion at this awful disclosure  come rose its too bad to tell her little tricks before everyone and preach at her in that way you wouldnt like it yourself began dr alec taking the weeper on his knee and administering consolation in the shape of kisses and nuts  before rose could express her regret jamie who had been reddening and ruffling like a little turkeycock for several minutes burst out indignantly bent on avenging the wound given to his beloved dolly  i know something bad that you did and im going to tell right out you thought we didnt see you but we did and you said uncle wouldnt like it and the boys would tease and you made ariadne promise not to tell and she punched holes in your ears to put earrings in so now and thats much badder than to take an old piece of rag and i hate you for making my pokey cry  jamies somewhat incoherent explosion produced such an effect that pokeys small sin was instantly forgotten and rose felt that her hour had come  what what what cried the boys in a chorus dropping their shovels and knives to gather round rose for a guilty clutching at her ears betrayed her and with a feeble cry of ariadne made me she hid her head among the pillows like an absurd little ostrich  now shell go prancing round with bird cages and baskets and carts and pigs for all i know in her ears as the other girls do and wont she look like a goose asked one tormentor tweaking a curl that strayed out from the cushions  i didnt think shed be so silly said mac in a tone of disappointment that told rose she had sunk in the esteem of her wise cousin  that blish girl is a nuisance and ought not to be allowed to come here with her nonsensical notions said the prince feeling a strong desire to shake that young person as an angry dog might shake a mischievous kitten  how do you like it uncle asked archie who being the head of a family himself believed in preserving discipline at all costs  i am very much surprised but i see she is a girl after all and must have her vanities like all the rest of them answered dr alec with a sigh as if he had expected to find rose a sort of angel above all earthly temptations  what shall you do about it sir inquired geordie wondering what punishment would be inflicted on a feminine culprit  as she is fond of ornaments perhaps we had better give her a nosering also i have one somewhere that a fiji belle once wore ill look it up and leaving pokey to jamies care dr alec rose as if to carry out his suggestion in earnest  good good well do it right away heres a gimlet so you hold her boys while i get her dear little nose all ready cried charlie whisking away the pillow as the other boys danced about the sofa in true fiji style  it was a dreadful moment for rose could not run away she could only grasp her precious nose with one hand and extend the other crying distractedly  o uncle save me save me  of course he saved her and when she was securely barricaded by his strong arm she confessed her folly in such humiliation of spirit that the lads after a good laugh at her decided to forgive her and lay all the blame on the tempter ariadne even dr alec relented so far as to propose two gold rings for the ears instead of one copper one for the nose a proceeding which proved that if rose had all the weakness of her sex for jewellery he had all the inconsistency of his in giving a pretty penitent exactly what she wanted spite of his better judgment    chapter 16 bread and buttonholes  what in the world is my girl thinking about all alone here with such a solemn face asked dr alec coming into the study one november day to find rose sitting there with folded hands and a very thoughtful aspect  uncle i want to have some serious conversation with you if you have time she said coming out of a brown study as if she had not heard his question  im entirely at your service and most happy to listen he answered in his politest manner for when rose put on her womanly little airs he always treated her with a playful sort of respect that pleased her very much  now as he sat down beside her she said very soberly  ive been trying to decide what trade i would learn and i want you to advise me  trade my dear and dr alec looked so astonished that she hastened to explain  i forgot that you didnt hear the talk about it up at cosey corner you see we used to sit under the pines and sew and talk a great deal all the ladies i mean and i liked it very much mother atkinson thought that everyone should have a trade or something to make a living out of for rich people may grow poor you know and poor people have to work her girls were very clever and could do ever so many things and aunt jessie thought the old lady was right so when i saw how happy and independent those young ladies were i wanted to have a trade and then it wouldnt matter about money though i like to have it well enough  dr alec listened to this explanation with a curious mixture of surprise pleasure and amusement in his face and looked at his little niece as if she had suddenly changed into a young woman she had grown a good deal in the last six months and an amount of thinking had gone on in that young head which would have astonished him greatly could he have known it all for rose was one of the children who observe and meditate much and now and then nonplus their friends by a wise or curious remark  i quite agree with the ladies and shall be glad to help you decide on something if i can said the doctor seriously what do you incline to a natural taste or talent is a great help in choosing you know  i havent any talent or any especial taste that i can see and that is why i cant decide uncle so i think it would be a good plan to pick out some very useful business and learn it because i dont do it for pleasure you see but as a part of my education and to be ready in case im ever poor answered rose looking as if she rather longed for a little poverty so that her useful gift might be exercised  well now there is one very excellent necessary and womanly accomplishment that no girl should be without for it is a help to rich and poor and the comfort of families depends upon it this fine talent is neglected nowadays and considered oldfashioned which is a sad mistake and one that i dont mean to make in bringing up my girl it should be a part of every girls education and i know of a most accomplished lady who will teach you in the best and pleasantest manner  oh what is it cried rose eagerly charmed to be met in this helpful and cordial way  housekeeping answered dr alec  is that an accomplishment asked rose while her face fell for she had indulged in all sorts of vague delightful dreams  yes it is one of the most beautiful as well as useful of all the arts a woman can learn not so romantic perhaps as singing painting writing or teaching even but one that makes many happy and comfortable and home the sweetest place in the world yes you may open your big eyes but it is a fact that i had rather see you a good housekeeper than the greatest belle in the city it need not interfere with any talent you may possess but it is a necessary part of your training and i hope that you will set about it at once now that you are well and strong  who is the lady asked rose rather impressed by her uncles earnest speech  aunt plenty  is she accomplished began rose in a wondering tone for this greataunt of hers had seemed the least cultivated of them all  in the good oldfashioned way she is very accomplished and has made this house a happy home to us all ever since we can remember she is not elegant but genuinely good and so beloved and respected that there will be universal mourning for her when her place is empty no one can fill it for the solid homely virtues of the dear soul have gone out of fashion as i say and nothing new can be half so satisfactory to me at least  i should like to have people feel so about me can she teach me to do what she does and to grow as good asked rose with a little prick of remorse for even thinking that aunt plenty was a commonplace old lady  yes if you dont despise such simple lessons as she can give i know it would fill her dear old heart with pride and pleasure to feel that anyone cared to learn of her for she fancies her day gone by let her teach you how to be what she has been a skilful frugal cheerful housewife the maker and the keeper of a happy home and by and by you will see what a valuable lesson it is  i will uncle but how shall i begin  ill speak to her about it and she will make it all right with dolly for cooking is one of the main things you know  so it is i dont mind that a bit for i like to mess and used to try at home but i had no one to tell me so i never did much but spoil my aprons pies are great fun only dolly is so cross i dont believe she will ever let me do a thing in the kitchen  then well cook in the parlour i fancy aunt plenty will manage her so dont be troubled only mind this id rather you learned how to make good bread than the best pies ever baked when you bring me a handsome wholesome loaf entirely made by yourself i shall be more pleased than if you offered me a pair of slippers embroidered in the very latest style i dont wish to bribe you but ill give you my heartiest kiss and promise to eat every crumb of the loaf myself  its a bargain its a bargain come and tell aunty all about it for im in a hurry to begin cried rose dancing before him toward the parlor where miss plenty sat alone knitting contentedly yet ready to run at the first call for help of any sort from any quarter  no need to tell how surprised and gratified she was at the invitation she received to teach the child the domestic arts which were her only accomplishments nor to relate how energetically she set about her pleasant task dolly dared not grumble for miss plenty was the one person whom she obeyed and phebe openly rejoiced for these new lessons brought rose nearer to her and glorified the kitchen in the good girls eyes  to tell the truth the elder aunts had sometimes felt that they did not have quite their share of the little niece who had won their hearts long ago and was the sunshine of the house they talked it over together sometimes but always ended by saying that as alec had all the responsibility he should have the larger share of the dear girls love and time and they would be contented with such crumbs of comfort as they could get  dr alec had found out this little secret and after reproaching himself for being blind and selfish was trying to devise some way of mending matters without troubling anyone when roses new whim suggested an excellent method of weaning her a little from himself he did not know how fond he was of her till he gave her up to the new teacher and often could not resist peeping in at the door to see how she got on or stealing sly looks through the slide when she was deep in dough or listening intently to some impressive lecture from aunt plenty they caught him at it now and then and ordered him off the premises at the point of the rollingpin or if unusually successful and therefore in a milder mood they lured him away with bribes of gingerbread a stray pickle or a tart that was not quite symmetrical enough to suit their critical eyes  of course he made a point of partaking copiously of all the delectable messes that now appeared at table for both the cooks were on their mettle and he fared sumptuously every day but an especial relish was given to any dish when in reply to his honest praise of it rose coloured up with innocent pride and said modestly  i made that uncle and im glad you like it  it was some time before the perfect loaf appeared for breadmaking is an art not easily learned and aunt plenty was very thorough in her teaching so rose studied yeast first and through various stages of cake and biscuit came at last to the crowning glory of the handsome wholesome loaf it appeared at teatime on a silver salver proudly borne in by phebe who could not refrain from whispering with a beaming face as she set it down before dr alec  aint it just lovely sir  it is a regularly splendid loaf did my girl make it all herself he asked surveying the shapely sweetsmelling object with real interest and pleasure  every particle herself and never asked a bit of help or advice from anyone answered aunt plenty folding her hands with an air of unmitigated satisfaction for her pupil certainly did her great credit  ive had so many failures and troubles that i really thought i never should be able to do it alone dolly let one splendid batch burn up because i forgot it she was there and smelt it but never did a thing for she said when i undertook to bake bread i must give my whole mind to it wasnt it hard she might have called me at least said rose recollecting with a sigh the anguish of that moment  she meant you should learn by experience as rosamond did in that little affair of the purple jar you remember  i always thought it very unfair in her mother not to warn the poor thing a little bit and she was regularly mean when rosamond asked for a bowl to put the purple stuff in and she said in such a provoking way i did not agree to lend you a bowl but i will my dear ugh i always want to shake that hateful woman though she was a moral mamma  never mind her now but tell me all about my loaf said dr alec much amused at roses burst of indignation  theres nothing to tell uncle except that i did my best gave my mind to it and sat watching over it all the while it was in the oven till i was quite baked myself everything went right this time and it came out a nice round crusty loaf as you see now taste it and tell me if it is good as well as handsome  must i cut it cant i put it under a glass cover and keep it in the parlor as they do wax flowers and fine works of that sort  what an idea uncle it would mould and be spoilt besides people would laugh at us and make fun of my oldfashioned accomplishment you promised to eat it and you must not all at once but as soon as you can so i can make you some more  dr alec solemnly cut off his favourite crusty slice and solemnly ate it then wiped his lips and brushing back roses hair solemnly kissed her on the forehead saying heartily  my dear it is perfect bread and you are an honour to your teacher when we have our model school i shall offer a prize for the best bread and you will get it  ive got it already and im quite satisfied said rose slipping into her seat and trying to hide her right hand which had a burn on it  but dr alec saw it guessed how it came there and after tea insisted on easing the pain which she would hardly confess  aunt clara says i am spoiling my hands but i dont care for ive had such good times with aunt plenty and i think she has enjoyed it as much as i have only one thing troubles me uncle and i want to ask you about it said rose as they paced up and down the hall in the twilight the bandaged hand very carefully laid on dr alecs arm  more little confidences i like them immensely so tell away my dear  well you see i feel as if aunt peace would like to do something for me and ive found out what it can be you know she cant go about like aunty plen and we are so busy nowadays that she is rather lonely im afraid so i want to take lessons in sewing of her she works so beautifully and it is a useful thing you know and i ought to be a good needlewoman as well as housekeeper oughtnt i  bless your kind little heart that is what i was thinking of the other day when aunt peace said she saw you very seldom now you were so busy i wanted to speak of it but fancied you had as much on your hands as you could manage it would delight the dear woman to teach you all her delicate handicraft especially buttonholes for i believe that is where young ladies fail at least ive heard them say so so do you devote your mind to buttonholes make em all over my clothes if you want something to practice on ill wear any quantity  rose laughed at this reckless offer but promised to attend to that important branch though she confessed that darning was her weak point whereupon uncle alec engaged to supply her with socks in all stages of dilapidation and to have a new set at once so that she could run the heels for him as a pleasant beginning  then they went up to make their request in due form to the great delight of gentle aunt peace who got quite excited with the fun that went on while they would yarn looked up darning needles and fitted out a nice little mending basket for her pupil  very busy and very happy were roses days now for in the morning she went about the house with aunt plenty attending to linenclosets and storerooms pickling and preserving exploring garret and cellar to see that all was right and learning in the good oldfashioned manner to look well after the ways of the household  in the afternoon after her walk or drive she sat with aunt peace plying her needle while aunt plenty whose eyes were failing knitted and chatted briskly telling many a pleasant story of old times till the three were moved to laugh and cry together for the busy needles were embroidering all sorts of bright patterns on the lives of the workers though they seemed to be only stitching cotton and darning hose  it was a pretty sight to see the rosyfaced little maid sitting between the two old ladies listening dutifully to their instructions and cheering the lessons with her lively chatter and blithe laugh if the kitchen had proved attractive to dr alec when rose was there at work the sewingroom was quite irresistible and he made himself so agreeable that no one had the heart to drive him away especially when he read aloud or spun yarns  there ive made you a new set of warm nightgowns with four buttonholes in each see if they are not neatly done said rose one day some weeks after the new lessons began  even to a thread and nice little bars across the end so i cant tear them when i twitch the buttons out most superior work maam and im deeply grateful so much so that ill sew on these buttons myself and save those tired fingers from another prick  you sew them on cried rose with her eyes wide open in amazement  wait a bit till i get my sewing tackle and then you shall see what i can do  can he really asked rose of aunt peace as uncle alec marched off with a comical air of importance  oh yes i taught him years ago before he went to sea and i suppose he has had to do things for himself more or less ever since so he has kept his hand in  he evidently had for he was soon back with a funny little workbag out of which he produced a thimble without a top and having threaded his needle he proceeded to sew on the buttons so handily that rose was much impressed and amused  i wonder if there is anything in the world that you cannot do she said in a tone of respectful admiration  there are one or two things that i am not up to yet he answered with a laugh in the corner of his eye as he waxed his thread with a flourish  i should like to know what  bread and buttonholes maam    chapter 17 good bargains  it was a rainy sunday afternoon and four boys were trying to spend it quietly in the liberry as jamie called the room devoted to books and boys at aunt jessies will and geordie were sprawling on the sofa deep in the adventures of the scapegraces and ragamuffins whose histories are now the fashion archie lounged in the easy chair surrounded by newspapers charlie stood upon the rug in an englishmans favourite attitude and i regret to say both were smoking cigars  it is my opinion that this day will never come to an end said prince with a yawn that nearly rent him asunder  read and improve your mind my son answered archie peering solemnly over the paper behind which he had been dozing  dont you preach parson but put on your boots and come out for a tramp instead of mulling over the fire like a granny  no thank you tramps in an easterly storm dont strike me as amusing  there archie stopped and held up his hand for a pleasant voice was heard saying outside  are the boys in the library auntie  yes dear and longing for sunshine so run in and make it for them  answered mrs jessie  its rose and archie threw his cigar into the fire  whats that for asked charlie  gentlemen dont smoke before ladies  true but im not going to waste my weed and prince poked his into the empty inkstand that served them for an ash tray  a gentle tap at the door was answered by a chorus of come in and rose appeared looking blooming and breezy with the chilly air  if i disturb you say so and ill go away she began pausing on the threshold with modest hesitation for something in the elder boys faces excited her curiosity  you never disturb us cousin said the smokers while the readers tore themselves from the heroes of the barroom and gutter long enough to nod affably to their guest  as rose bent to warm her hands one end of archies cigar stuck out of the ashes smoking furiously and smelling strongly  oh you bad boys how could you do it today of all days she said reproachfully  wheres the harm asked archie  you know as well as i do your mother doesnt like it and its a bad habit for it wastes money and does you no good  fiddlesticks every man smokes even uncle alec whom you think so perfect began charlie in his teasing way  no he doesnt he has given it up and i know why cried rose eagerly  now i think of it i havent seen the old meerschaum since he came home did he stop it on our account asked archie  yes and rose told the little scene on the seashore in the campingout time  archie seemed much impressed and said manfully he wont have done that in vain so far as im concerned i dont care a pin about smoking so can give it up as easy as not and i promise you i will i only do it now and then for fun  you too and rose looked up at the bonny prince who never looked less bonny than at that moment for he had resumed his cigar just to torment her  now charlie cared as little as archie about smoking but it would not do to yield too soon  so he shook his head gave a great puff and said loftily  you women are always asking us to give up harmless little things just because you dont approve of them how would you like it if we did the same by you miss  if i did harmful or silly things id thank you for telling me of them and id try to mend my ways answered rose heartily  well now well see if you mean what you say ill give up smoking to please you if you will give up something to please me said prince seeing a good chance to lord it over the weaker vessel at small cost to himself  ill agree if it is as foolish as cigars  oh its ever so much sillier  then i promise what is it and rose quite trembled with anxiety to know which of her pet habits or possessions she must lose  give up your earrings and charlie laughed wickedly sure that she would never hold to that bargain  rose uttered a cry and clapped both hands to her ears where the gold rings hung  oh charlie wouldnt anything else do as well ive been through so much teasing and trouble i do want to enjoy my pretty earrings for i can wear them now  wear as many as you like and ill smoke in peace returned this bad boy  will nothing else satisfy you imploringly  nothing sternly  rose stood silent for a minute thinking of something aunt jessie once said you have more influence over the boys than you know use it for their good and i shall thank you all my life here was a chance to do some good by sacrificing a little vanity of her own she felt it was right to do it yet found it very hard and asked wistfully  do you mean never wear them charlie  never unless you want me to smoke  i never do  then clinch the bargain  he had no idea she would do it and was much surprised when she took the dear rings from her ears with a quick gesture and held them out to him saying in a tone that made the colour come up to his brown cheek it was so full of sweet good will  i care more for my cousins than for my earrings so i promise and ill keep my word  for shame prince let her wear her little danglers if she likes and dont bargain about doing what you know is right cried archie coming out of his grove of newspapers with an indignant bounce  but rose was bent on showing her aunt that she could use her influence for the boys good and said steadily  it is fair and i want it to be so then you will believe im in earnest here each of you wear one of these on your watchguard to remind you i shall not forget because very soon i cannot wear earrings if i want to  as she spoke rose offered a little ring to each cousin and the boys seeing how sincere she was obeyed her when the pledges were safe rose stretched a hand to each and the lads gave hers a hearty grip half pleased and half ashamed of their part in the compact  just at that moment dr alec and mrs jessie came in  whats this dancing ladies triumph on sunday exclaimed uncle alec surveying the trio with surprise  no sir it is the antitobacco league will you join said charlie while rose slipped away to her aunt and archie buried both cigars behind the back log  when the mystery was explained the elders were well pleased and rose received a vote of thanks which made her feel as if she had done a service to her country as she had for every boy who grows up free from bad habits bids fair to make a good citizen  i wish rose would drive a bargain with will and geordie also for i think these books are as bad for the small boys as cigars for the large ones said mrs jessie sitting down on the sofa between the readers who politely curled up their legs to make room for her  i thought they were all the fashion answered dr alec settling in the big chair with rose  so is smoking but it is harmful the writers of these popular stories intend to do good i have no doubt but it seems to me they fail because their motto is be smart and you will be rich instead of be honest and you will be happy i do not judge hastily alec for i have read a dozen at least of these stories and with much that is attractive to boys i find a great deal to condemn in them and other parents say the same when i ask them  now mum thats too bad i like em tiptop this one is a regular screamer cried will  theyre bully books and id like to know wheres the harm added geordie  you have just shown us one of the chief evils and that is slang  answered their mother quickly  must have it maam if these chaps talked all right thered be no fun in em protested will  a bootblack mustnt use good grammar and a newsboy must swear a little or he wouldnt be natural explained geordie both boys ready to fight gallantly for their favourites  but my sons are neither bootblacks nor newsboys and i object to hearing them use such words as screamer bully and buster in fact i fail to see the advantage of writing books about such people unless it is done in a very different way i cannot think they will help to refine the ragamuffins if they read them and im sure they can do no good to the better class of boys who through these books are introduced to police courts counterfeiters dens gambling houses drinking saloons and all sorts of low life  some of them are about firstrate boys mother and they go to sea and study and sail round the world having great larks all the way  i have read about them geordie and though they are better than the others i am not satisfied with these optical delusions as i call them now i put it to you boys is it natural for lads from fifteen to eighteen to command ships defeat pirates outwit smugglers and so cover themselves with glory that admiral farragut invites them to dinner saying noble boy you are an honour to your country or if the hero is in the army he has hairbreadth escapes and adventures enough in one small volume to turn his hair white and in the end he goes to washington at the express desire of the president or commanderinchief to be promoted to no end of stars and bars even if the hero is merely an honest boy trying to get his living he is not permitted to do so in a natural way by hard work and years of patient effort but is suddenly adopted by a millionaire whose pocketbook he has returned or a rich uncle appears from sea just in the nick of time or the remarkable boy earns a few dollars speculates in peanuts or neckties and grows rich so rapidly that sinbad in the diamond valley is a pauper compared to him isnt it so boys  well the fellows in these books are mighty lucky and very smart i must say answered will surveying an illustration on the open page before him where a small but virtuous youth is upsetting a tipsy giant in a barroom and under it the elegant inscription dick dauntless punches the head of sam soaker  it gives boys such wrong ideas of life and business shows them so much evil and vulgarity that they need not know about and makes the one success worth having a fortune a lords daughter or some worldly honour often not worth the time it takes to win it does seem to me that some one might write stories that should be lively natural and helpful tales in which the english should be good the morals pure and the characters such as we can love in spite of the faults that all may have i cant bear to see such crowds of eager little fellows at the libraries reading such trash weak when it is not wicked and totally unfit to feed the hungry minds that feast on it for want of something better there my lecture is done now i should like to hear what you gentlemen have to say and aunt jessie subsided with a pretty flush on the face that was full of motherly anxiety for her boys  tom brown just suits mother and me too so i wish mr hughes would write another story as good said archie  you dont find things of this sort in tom brown yet these books are all in the sundayschool libraries and mrs jessie read the following paragraph from the book she had taken from wills hand  in this place we saw a tooth of john the baptist ben said he could see locust and wild honey sticking to it i couldnt perhaps john used a piece of the true cross for a toothpick  a larky sort of a boy says that mum and we skip the parts where they describe what they saw in the different countries cried will  and those descriptions taken mostly from guidebooks i fancy are the only parts of any real worth the scrapes of the bad boys make up the rest of the story and it is for those you read these books i think  answered his mother stroking back the hair off the honest little face that looked rather abashed at this true statement of the case  anyway mother the ship part is useful for we learn how to sail her and by and by that will all come handy when we go to sea put in geordie  indeed then you can explain this manoeuvre to me of course and mrs jessie read from another page the following nautical paragraph  the wind is southsouthwest and we can have her up four points closer to the wind and still be six points off the wind as she luffs up we shall man the fore and main sheets slack on the weather and haul on the lee braces  i guess i could if i wasnt afraid of uncle he knows so much more than i do hed laugh began geordie evidently puzzled by the question  ho you know you cant so why make believe we dont understand half of the sea lingo mum and i dare say its all wrong cried will suddenly going over to the enemy to geordies great disgust  i do wish the boys wouldnt talk to me as if i was a ship said rose bringing forward a private grievance coming home from church this morning the wind blew me about and will called out right in the street brail up the foresail and take in the flyingjib that will ease her  the boys shouted at the plaintive tone in which rose repeated the words that offended her and will vainly endeavoured to explain that he only meant to tell her to wrap her cloak closer and tie a veil over the tempesttossed feathers in her hat  to tell the truth if the boys must have slang i can bear the sea lingo as will calls it better than the other it afflicts me less to hear my sons talk about brailing up the foresail than doing as they darn please and cut your cable is decidedly preferable to let her rip i once made a rule that i would have no slang in the house i give it up now for i cannot keep it but i will not have rubbishy books so archie please send these two after your cigars  mrs jessie held both the small boys fast with an arm round each neck and when she took this base advantage of them they could only squirm with dismay yes right behind the back log she continued energetically there my hearties you like sea slang so ill give you a bit now i want you to promise not to read any more stuff for a month and ill agree to supply you with wholesome fare  oh mother not a single one cried will  couldnt we just finish those pleaded geordie  the boys threw away halfsmoked cigars and your books must go after them surely you would not be outdone by the old fellows as you call them or be less obedient to little mum than they were to rose  course not come on geordie and will took the vow like a hero his brother sighed and obeyed but privately resolved to finish his story the minute the month was over  you have laid out a hard task for yourself jessie in trying to provide good reading for boys who have been living on sensation stories it will be like going from raspberry tarts to plain bread and butter but you will probably save them from a bilious fever said dr alec much amused at the proceedings  i remember hearing grandpa say that a love for good books was one of the best safeguards a man could have began archie staring thoughtfully at the fine library before him  yes but theres no time to read nowadays a fellow has to keep scratching round to make money or hes nobody cut in charlie trying to look worldlywise  this love of money is the curse of america and for the sake of it men will sell honour and honesty till we dont know whom to trust and it is only a genius like agassiz who dares to say i cannot waste my time in getting rich said mrs jessie sadly  do you want us to be poor mother asked archie wondering  no dear and you never need be while you can use your hands but i am afraid of this thirst for wealth and the temptations it brings o my boys i tremble for the time when i must let you go because i think it would break my heart to have you fail as so many fail it would be far easier to see you dead if it could be said of you as of sumner no man dared offer him a bribe  mrs jessie was so earnest in her motherly anxiety that her voice faltered over the last words and she hugged the yellow heads closer in her arms as if she feared to let them leave that safe harbour for the great sea where so many little boats go down the younger lads nestled closer to her and archie said in his quiet resolute way  i cannot promise to be an agassiz or a sumner mother but i do promise to be an honest man please god  then im satisfied and holding fast the hand he gave her she sealed his promise with a kiss that had all a mothers hope and faith in it  i dont see how they ever can be bad she is so fond and proud of them whispered rose quite touched by the little scene  you must help her make them what they should be you have begun already and when i see those rings where they are my girl is prettier in my sight than if the biggest diamonds that ever twinkled shone in her ears answered dr alec looking at her with approving eyes  im so glad you think i can do anything for i perfectly ache to be useful everyone is so good to me especially aunt jessie  i think you are in a fair way to pay your debts rosy for when girls give up their little vanities and boys their small vices and try to strengthen each other in welldoing matters are going as they ought work away my dear and help their mother keep these sons fit friends for an innocent creature like yourself they will be the manlier men for it i can assure you    chapter 18 fashion and physiology  please sir i guess youd better step up right away or it will be too late for i heard miss rose say she knew you wouldnt like it and shed never dare to let you see her  phebe said this as she popped her head into the study where dr alec sat reading a new book  they are at it are they he said looking up quickly and giving himself a shake as if ready for a battle of some sort  yes sir as hard as they can talk and miss rose dont seem to know what to do for the things are ever so stylish and she looks elegant in em though i like her best in the old ones answered phebe  you are a girl of sense ill settle matters for rosy and youll lend a hand is everything ready in her room and are you sure you understand how they go  oh yes sir but they are so funny i know miss rose will think its a joke and phebe laughed as if something tickled her immensely  never mind what she thinks so long as she obeys tell her to do it for my sake and she will find it the best joke she ever saw i expect to have a tough time of it but well win yet said the doctor as he marched upstairs with the book in his hand and an odd smile on his face  there was such a clatter of tongues in the sewingroom that no one heard his tap at the door so he pushed it open and took an observation aunt plenty aunt clara and aunt jessie were all absorbed in gazing at rose who slowly revolved between them and the great mirror in a full winter costume of the latest fashion  bless my heart worse even than i expected thought the doctor with an inward groan for to his benighted eyes the girl looked like a trussed fowl and the fine new dress had neither grace beauty nor fitness to recommend it  the suit was of two peculiar shades of blue so arranged that patches of light and dark distracted the eye the upper skirt was tied so lightly back that it was impossible to take a long step and the under one was so loaded with plaited frills that it wobbled no other word will express it ungracefully both fore and aft a bunch of folds was gathered up just below the waist behind and a great bow rode atop a small jacket of the same material was adorned with a high ruff at the back and laid well open over the breast to display some lace and a locket heavy fringes bows puffs ruffles and revers finished off the dress making ones head ache to think of the amount of work wasted for not a single graceful line struck the eye and the beauty of the material was quite lost in the profusion of ornament  a high velvet hat audaciously turned up in front with a bunch of pink roses and a sweeping plume was cocked over one ear and with her curls braided into a club at the back of her neck roses head looked more like that of a dashing young cavalier than a modest little girls highheeled boots tilted her well forward a tiny muff pinioned her arms and a spotted veil tied so closely over her face that her eyelashes were rumpled by it gave the last touch of absurdity to her appearance  now she looks like other girls and as i like to see her mrs clara was saying with an air of great satisfaction  she does look like a fashionable young lady but somehow i miss my little rose for children dressed like children in my day answered aunt plenty peering through her glasses with a troubled look for she could not imagine the creature before her ever sitting in her lap running to wait upon her or making the house gay with a childs blithe presence  things have changed since your day aunt and it takes time to get used to new ways but you jessie surely like this costume better than the dowdy things rose has been wearing all summer now be honest and own you do said mrs clara bent on being praised for her work  well dear to be quite honest then i think it is frightful answered mrs jessie with a candour that caused revolving rose to stop in dismay  hear hear cried a deep voice and with a general start the ladies became aware that the enemy was among them  rose blushed up to her hat brim and stood looking as she felt like a fool while mrs clara hastened to explain  of course i dont expect you to like it alec but i dont consider you a judge of what is proper and becoming for a young lady therefore i have taken the liberty of providing a pretty street suit for rose she need not wear it if you object for i know we promised to let you do what you liked with the poor dear for a year  it is a street costume is it asked the doctor mildly do you know i never should have guessed that it was meant for winter weather and brisk locomotion take a turn rosy and let me see all its beauties and advantages  rose tried to walk off with her usual free tread but the underskirt got in her way the overskirt was so tight she could not take a long step and her boots made it impossible to carry herself perfectly erect  i havent got used to it yet she said petulantly kicking at her train as she turned to toddle back again  suppose a mad dog or a runaway horse was after you could you get out of the way without upsetting colonel asked the doctor with a twinkle in the eyes that were fixed on the rakish hat  dont think i could but ill try and rose made a rush across the room her bootheels caught on a rug several strings broke her hat tipped over her eyes and she plunged promiscuously into a chair where she sat laughing so infectiously that all but mrs clara joined in her mirth  i should say that a walking suit in which one could not walk and a winter suit which exposes the throat head and feet to cold and damp was rather a failure clara especially as it has no beauty to reconcile one to its utter unfitness said dr alec as he helped rose undo her veil adding in a low tone nice thing for the eyes youll soon see spots when its off as well as when its on and by and by be a case for an oculist  no beauty cried mrs clara warmly now that is just a mans blindness this is the best of silk and camels hair real ostrich feathers and an expensive ermine muff what could be in better taste or more proper for a young girl  ill shew you if rose will go to her room and oblige me by putting on what she finds there answered the doctor with unexpected readiness  alec if it is a bloomer i shall protest ive been expecting it but i know i cannot bear to see that pretty child sacrificed to your wild ideas of health tell me it isnt a bloomer and mrs clara clasped her hands imploringly  it is not  thank heaven and she resigned herself with a sigh of relief adding plaintively i did hope youd accept my suit for poor rose has been afflicted with frightful clothes long enough to spoil the taste of any girl  you talk of my afflicting the child and then make a helpless guy like that of her answered the doctor pointing to the little fashion plate that was scuttling out of sight as fast as it could go  he closed the door with a shrug but before anyone could speak his quick eye fell upon an object which caused him to frown and demand in an indignant tone  after all i have said were you really going to tempt my girl with those abominable things  i thought we put them away when she wouldnt wear them murmured mrs clara whisking a little pair of corsets out of sight with guilty haste i only brought them to try for rose is growing stout and will have no figure if it is not attended to soon she added with an air of calm conviction that roused the doctor still more for this was one of his especial abominations  growing stout yes thank heaven she is and shall continue to do it for nature knows how to mould a woman better than any corsetmaker and i wont have her interfered with my dear clara have you lost your senses that you can for a moment dream of putting a growing girl into an instrument of torture like this and with a sudden gesture he plucked forth the offending corsets from under the sofa cushion and held them out with the expression one would wear on beholding the thumbscrews or the rack of ancient times  dont be absurd alec there is no torture about it for tight lacing is out of fashion and we have nice sensible things nowadays everyone wears them even babies have stiffened waists to support their weak little backs began mrs clara rushing to the defence of the pet delusion of most women  i know it and so the poor little souls have weak backs all their days as their mothers had before them it is vain to argue the matter and i wont try but i wish to state once for all that if i ever see a pair of corsets near rose ill put them in the fire and you may send the bill to me  as he spoke the corsets were on their way to destruction but mrs jessie caught his arm exclaiming merrily dont burn them for mercy sake alec they are full of whalebones and will make a dreadful odour give them to me ill see that they do no harm  whalebones indeed a regular fence of them and metal gateposts in front as if our own bones were not enough if wed give them a chance to do their duty growled the doctor yielding up the bone of contention with a last shake of contempt then his face cleared suddenly and he held up his finger saying with a smile hear those girls laugh cramped lungs could not make hearty music like that  peals of laughter issued from roses room and smiles involuntarily touched the lips of those who listened to the happy sound  some new prank of yours alec asked aunt plenty indulgently for she had come to believe in most of her nephews odd notions because they seemed to work so well  yes maam my last and i hope you will like it i discovered what clara was at and got my rival suit ready for today im not going to afflict rose but let her choose and if im not entirely mistaken she will like my rig best while we wait ill explain and then you will appreciate the general effect better i got hold of this little book and was struck with its good sense and good taste for it suggests a way to clothe women both healthfully and handsomely and that is a great point it begins at the foundations as you will see if you will look at these pictures and i should think women would rejoice at this lightening of their burdens  as he spoke the doctor laid the book before aunt plenty who obediently brought her spectacles to bear upon the illustrations and after a long look exclaimed with a scandalised face  mercy on us these things are like the nightdrawers jamie wears you dont mean to say you want rose to come out in this costume its not proper and i wont consent to it  i do mean it and im sure my sensible aunt will consent when she understands that these well ill call them by an indian name and say pajamas are for underwear and rose can have as pretty frocks as she likes outside these two suits of flannel each in one piece from head to foot with a skirt or so hung on this easilyfitting waist will keep the child warm without burdening her with belts and gathers and buckles and bunches round the waist and leave free the muscles that need plenty of room to work in she shall never have the backache if i can help it nor the long list of ills you dear women think you cannot escape  i dont consider it modest and im sure rose will be shocked at it  began mrs clara but stopped suddenly as rose appeared in the doorway not looking shocked a bit  come on my hygienic model and let us see you said her uncle with an approving glance as she walked in looking so mischievously merry that it was evident she enjoyed the joke  well i dont see anything remarkable that is a neat plain suit the materials are good and its not unbecoming if you want her to look like a little schoolgirl but it has not a particle of style and no one would ever give it a second glance said mrs clara feeling that her last remark condemned the whole thing  exactly what i want answered the provoking doctor rubbing his hands with a satisfied air rosy looks now like what she is a modest little girl who does not want to be stared at i think she would get a glance of approval though from people who like sense and simplicity rather than fuss and feathers revolve my hebe and let me refresh my eyes by the sight of you  there was very little to see however only a pretty gabrielle dress of a soft warm shade of brown coming to the tops of a trim pair of boots with low heels a sealskin sack cap and mittens with a glimpse of scarlet at the throat and the pretty curls tied up with a bright velvet of the same colour completed the external adornment making her look like a robin redbreast wintry yet warm  how do you like it rosy asked the doctor feeling that her opinion was more important to the success of his new idea than that of all the aunts on the hill  i feel very odd and light but im warm as a toast and nothing seems to be in my way answered rose with a skip which displayed shapely gaiters on legs that now might be as free and active as a boys under the modest skirts of the girl  you can run away from the mad dogs and walk off at a smart pace without tumbling on your nose now i fancy  yes uncle suppose the dog coming i just hop over a wall so and when i walk of a cold day i go like this  entering fully into the spirit of the thing rose swung herself over the high back of the sofa as easily as one of her cousins and then went down the long hall as if her stout boots were related to the famous sevenleaguers  there you see how it will be dress her in that boyish way and she will act like a boy i do hate all these inventions of strongminded women exclaimed mrs clara as rose came back at a run  ah but you see some of these sensible inventions come from the brain of a fashionable modiste who will make you more lovely or what you value more stylish outside and comfortable within mrs van tassel has been to madame stone and is wearing a full suit of this sort van himself told me when i asked how she was that she had given up lying on the sofa and was going about in a most astonishing way considering her feeble health  you dont say so let me see that book a moment and aunt clara examined the new patterns with a more respectful air for if the elegant mrs van tassel wore these dreadful things it would never do to be left behind in spite of her prejudices  dr alec looked at mrs jessie and both smiled for little mum had been in the secret and enjoyed it mightily  i thought that would settle it he said with a nod  i didnt wait for mrs van to lead the way and for once in my life i have adopted a new fashion before clara my freedom suit is ordered and you may see me playing tag with rose and the boys before long answered mrs jessie nodding back at him  meantime aunt plenty was examining roses costume for the hat and sack were off and the girl was eagerly explaining the new undergarments  see auntie all nice scarlet flannel and a gay little petticoat and long stockings oh so warm phebe and i nearly died laughing when i put this rig on but i like it ever so much the dress is so comfortable and doesnt need any belt or sash and i can sit without rumpling any trimming thats such a comfort i like to be tidy and so when i wear fussedup things im thinking of my clothes all the time and thats tiresome do say you like it i resolved i would just to please uncle for he does know more about health than anyone else im sure and id wear a bag if he asked me to do it  i dont ask that rose but i wish youd weigh and compare the two suits and then choose which seems best i leave it to your own commonsense answered dr alec feeling pretty sure he had won  why i take this one of course uncle the other is fashionable and yes i must say i think its pretty but its very heavy and i should have to go round like a walking doll if i wore it im much obliged to auntie but ill keep this please  rose spoke gently but decidedly though there was a look of regret when her eye fell on the other suit which phebe had brought in and it was very natural to like to look as other girls did aunt clara sighed uncle alec smiled and said heartily  thank you dear now read this book and you will understand why i ask it of you then if you like ill give you a new lesson you asked for one yesterday and this is more necessary than french or housekeeping  oh what and rose caught up the book which mrs clara had thrown down with a disgusted look  though dr alec was forty the boyish love of teasing was not yet dead in him and being much elated at his victory he could not resist the temptation of shocking mrs clara by suggesting dreadful possibilities so he answered half in earnest half in jest physiology rose wouldnt you like to be a little medical student with uncle doctor for teacher and be ready to take up his practice when he has to stop if you agree ill hunt up my old skeleton tomorrow  that was too much for aunt clara and she hastily departed with her mind in a sad state of perturbation about mrs van tassels new costume and roses new study    chapter 19 brother bones  rose accepted her uncles offer as aunt myra discovered two or three days later coming in for an early call and hearing voices in the study she opened the door gave a cry and shut it quickly looking a good deal startled the doctor appeared in a moment and begged to know what the matter was  how can you ask when that long box looks so like a coffin i thought it was one and that dreadful thing stared me in the face as i opened the door answered mrs myra pointing to the skeleton that hung from the chandelier cheerfully grinning at all beholders  this is a medical college where women are freely admitted so walk in madam and join the class if youll do me the honour said the doctor waving her forward with his politest bow  do auntie its perfectly splendid cried roses voice and roses blooming face was seen behind the ribs of the skeleton smiling and nodding in the gayest possible manner  what are you doing child demanded aunt myra dropping into a chair and staring about her  oh im learning bones today and i like it so much there are twelve ribs you know and the two lower ones are called floating ribs because they are not fastened to the breastbone thats why they go in so easily if you lace tight and squeeze the lungs and heart in the let me see what was that big word oh i know thoracic cavity and rose beamed with pride as she aired her little bit of knowledge  do you think that is a good sort of thing for her to be poking over she is a nervous child and im afraid it will be bad for her said aunt myra watching rose as she counted vertebrae and waggled a hipjoint in its socket with an inquiring expression  an excellent study for she enjoys it and i mean to teach her how to manage her nerves so that they wont be a curse to her as many a womans become through ignorance or want of thought to make a mystery or terror of these things is a mistake and i mean rose shall understand and respect her body so well that she wont dare to trifle with it as most women do  and she really likes it  very much auntie its all so wonderful and so nicely planned you can hardly believe what you see just think there are 600000000 air cells in one pair of lungs and 2000 pores to a square inch of surface so you see what quantities of air we must have and what care we should take of our skin so all the little doors will open and shut right and brains auntie youve no idea how curious they are i havent got to them yet but i long to and uncle is going to show me a manikin that you can take to pieces just think how nice it will be to see all the organs in their places i only wish they could be made to work as ours do  it was funny to see aunt myras face as rose stood before her talking rapidly with one hand laid in the friendliest manner on the skeletons shoulder every word both the doctor and rose uttered hit the good lady in her weakest spot and as she looked and listened a long array of bottles and pillboxes rose up before her reproaching her with the ignorance and want of thought that made her what she was a nervous dyspeptic unhappy old woman  well i dont know but you may be right alec only i wouldnt carry it too far women dont need much of this sort of knowledge and are not fit for it i couldnt bear to touch that ugly thing and it gives me the creeps to hear about organs said aunt myra with a sigh and her hand on her side  wouldnt it be a comfort to know that your liver was on the right side auntie and not on the left asked rose with a naughty laugh in her eyes for she had lately learnt that aunt myras liver complaint was not in the proper place  its a dying world child and it dont much matter where the pain is for sooner or later we all drop off and are seen no more was aunt myras cheerful reply  well i intend to know what kills me if i can and meantime im going to enjoy myself in spite of a dying world i wish youd do so too and come and study with uncle it would do you good im sure and rose went back to counting vertebrae with such a happy face that aunt myra had not the heart to say a word to dampen her ardour  perhaps its as well to let her do what she likes the little while she is with us but pray be careful of her alec and not allow her to overwork she whispered as she went out  thats exactly what im trying to do maam and rather a hard job i find it he added as he shut the door for the dear aunts were dreadfully in his way sometimes  half an hour later came another interruption in the shape of mac who announced his arrival by the brief but elegant remark  hullo what new game is this  rose explained mac gave a long whistle of surprise and then took a promenade round the skeleton observing gravely  brother bones looks very jolly but i cant say much for his beauty  you mustnt make fun of him for hes a good old fellow and youd be just as ugly if your flesh was off said rose defending her new friend with warmth  i dare say so ill keep my flesh on thank you you are so busy you cant read to a fellow i suppose asked mac whose eyes were better but still too weak for books  dont you want to come and join my class uncle explains it all to us and you can take a look at the plates as they come along well give up bones today and have eyes instead that will be more interesting to you added rose seeing no ardent thirst for physiological information in his face  rose we must not fly about from one thing to another in this way  began dr alec but she whispered quickly with a nod towards mac whose goggles were turned wistfully in the direction of the forbidden books  hes blue today and we must amuse him give a little lecture on eyes and it will do him good no matter about me uncle  very well the class will please be seated and the doctor gave a sounding rap on the table  come sit by me dear then we can both see the pictures and if your head gets tired you can lie down said rose generously opening her little college to a brother and kindly providing for the weaknesses that all humanity is subject to  side by side they sat and listened to a very simple explanation of the mechanism of the eye finding it as wonderful as a fairy tale for fine plates illustrated it and a very willing teacher did his best to make the lesson pleasant  jove if id known what mischief i was doing to that mighty delicate machine of mine you wouldnt have caught me reading by firelight or studying with a glare of sunshine on my book said mac peering solemnly at a magnified eyeball then pushing it away he added indignantly why isnt a fellow taught all about his works and how to manage em and not left to go blundering into all sorts of worries telling him after hes down isnt much use for then hes found it out himself and wont thank you  ah mac thats just what i keep lecturing about and people wont listen you lads need that sort of knowledge so much and fathers and mothers ought to be able to give it to you few of them are able and so we all go blundering as you say less greek and latin and more knowledge of the laws of health for my boys if i had them mathematics are all very well but morals are better and i wish how i wish that i could help teachers and parents to feel it as they ought  some do aunt jessie and her boys have capital talks and i wish we could but mothers so busy with her housekeeping and father with his business there never seems to be any time for that sort of thing even if there was it dont seem as if it would be easy to talk to them because weve never got into the way of it you know  poor mac was right there and expressed a want that many a boy and girl feels fathers and mothers are too absorbed in business and housekeeping to study their children and cherish that sweet and natural confidence which is a childs surest safeguard and a parents subtlest power so the young hearts hide trouble or temptation till the harm is done and mutual regret comes too late happy the boys and girls who tell all things freely to father or mother sure of pity help and pardon and thrice happy the parents who out of their own experience and by their own virtues can teach and uplift the souls for which they are responsible  this longing stirred in the hearts of rose and mac and by a natural impulse both turned to dr alec for in this queer world of ours fatherly and motherly hearts often beat warm and wise in the breasts of bachelor uncles and maiden aunts and it is my private opinion that these worthy creatures are a beautiful provision of nature for the cherishing of other peoples children they certainly get great comfort out of it and receive much innocent affection that otherwise would be lost  dr alec was one of these and his big heart had room for every one of the eight cousins especially orphaned rose and afflicted mac so when the boy uttered that unconscious reproach to his parents and rose added with a sigh it must be beautiful to have a mother the good doctor yearned over them and shutting his book with a decided slam said in that cordial voice of his  now look here children you just come and tell me all your worries and with gods help ill settle them for you that is what im here for i believe and it will be a great happiness to me if you can trust me  we can uncle and we will both answered with a heartiness that gratified him much  good now school is dismissed and i advise you to go and refresh your 600000000 air cells by a brisk run in the garden come again whenever you like mac and well teach you all we can about your works as you call them so you can keep them running smoothly  well come sir much obliged and the class in physiology went out to walk  mac did come again glad to find something he could study in spite of his weak eyes and learned much that was of more value than anything his school had ever taught him  of course the other lads made great fun of the whole thing and plagued dr alecs students half out of their lives but they kept on persistently and one day something happened which made the other fellows behave themselves for ever after  it was a holiday and rose up in her room thought she heard the voices of her cousins so she ran down to welcome them but found no one there  never mind they will be here soon and then well have a frolic she said to herself and thinking she had been mistaken she went into the study to wait she was lounging over the table looking at a map when an odd noise caught her ear a gentle tapping somewhere and following the sound it seemed to come from the inside of the long case in which the skeleton lived when not professionally engaged this case stood upright in a niche between two bookcases at the back of the room a darkish corner where brother bones as the boys would call him was out of the way  as rose stood looking in that direction and wondering if a rat had got shut in the door of the case swung slowly open and with a great start she saw a bony arm lifted and a bony finger beckon to her for a minute she was frightened and ran to the study door with a fluttering heart but just as she touched the handle a queer stifled sort of giggle made her stop short and turn red with anger she paused an instant to collect herself and then went softly toward the bony beckoner a nearer look revealed black threads tied to the arm and fingers the ends of threads disappearing through holes bored in the back of the case peeping into the dark recess she also caught sight of the tip of an elbow covered with a rough gray cloth which she knew very well  quick as a flash she understood the joke her fear vanished and with a wicked smile she whipped out her scissors cut the threads and the bony arm dropped with a rattle before she could say come out charlie and let my skeleton alone a sudden irruption of boys all in a high state of tickle proclaimed to the hidden rogue that his joke was a failure  i told him not to do it because it might give you a start explained archie emerging from the closet  i had a smelling bottle all ready if she fainted away added steve popping up from behind the great chair  its too bad of you not to squawk and run we depended on it its such fun to howl after you said will and geordie rolling out from under the sofa in a promiscuous heap  you are getting altogether too strongminded rose most girls would have been in a jolly twitter to see this old fellow waggling his finger at them complained charlie squeezing out from his tight quarters dusty and disgusted  im used to your pranks now so im always on the watch and prepared but i wont have brother bones made fun of i know uncle wouldnt like it so please dont began rose just as dr alec came in and seeing the state of the case at a glance he said quietly  hear how i got that skeleton and then im sure you will treat it with respect  the boys settled down at once on any article of furniture that was nearest and listened dutifully  years ago when i was in the hospital a poor fellow was brought there with a rare and very painful disease there was no hope for him but we did our best and he was so grateful that when he died he left us his body that we might discover the mysteries of his complaint and so be able to help others afflicted in the same way it did do good and his brave patience made us remember him long after he was gone he thought i had been kind to him and said to a fellowstudent of mine tell the doctor i lave him me bones for ive nothing else in the wide world and ill nos be wanting em at all at all when the great pain hat kilt me entirely so that is how they came to be mine and why ive kept them carefully for though only a poor ignorant fellow mike nolan did what he could to help others and prove his gratitude to those who tried to help him  as dr alec paused archie closed the door of the case as respectfully as if the mummy of an egyptian king was inside will and geordie looked solemnly at one another evidently much impressed and charlie pensively remarked from the coalhod where he sat  ive often heard of a skeleton in the house but i think few people have one as useful and as interesting as ours    chapter 20 under the mistletoe  rose made phebe promise that she would bring her stocking into the bower as she called her pretty room on christmas morning because that first delicious rummage loses half its charm if two little nightcaps at least do not meet over the treasures and two happy voices oh and ah together  so when rose opened her eyes that day they fell upon faithful phebe rolled up in a shawl sitting on the rug before a blazing fire with her untouched stocking laid beside her  merry christmas cried the little mistress smiling gaily  merry christmas answered the little maid so heartily that it did one good to hear her  bring the stockings right away phebe and lets see what weve got  said rose sitting up among the pillows and looking as eager as a child  a pair of long knobby hose were laid out upon the coverlet and their contents examined with delight though each knew every blessed thing that had been put into the others stocking  never mind what they were it is evident that they were quite satisfactory for as rose leaned back she said with a luxurious sigh of satisfaction now i believe ive got everything in the world that i want and phebe answered smiling over a lapful of treasures this is the most splendid christmas i ever had since i was born then she added with an important air  do wish for something else because i happen to know of two more presents outside the door this minute  oh me what richness cried rose much excited i used to wish for a pair of glass slippers like cinderellas but as i cant have them i really dont know what to ask for  phebe clapped her hands as she skipped off the bed and ran to the door saying merrily one of them is for your feet anyway i dont know what youll say to the other but i think its elegant  so did rose when a shining pair of skates and a fine sled appeared  uncle sent those i know he did and now i see them i remember that i did want to skate and coast isnt it a beauty see they fit nicely  and sitting on the new sled rose tried a skate on her little bare foot while phebe stood by admiring the pretty tableau  now we must hurry and get dressed for there is a deal to do today and i want to get through in time to try my sled before dinner  gracious me and i ought to be dusting my parlors this blessed minute  and mistress and maid separated with such happy faces that anyone would have known what day it was without being told  birnam wood has come to dunsinane rosy said dr alec as he left the breakfast table to open the door for a procession of holly hemlock and cedar boughs that came marching up the steps  snowballs and merry christmases flew about pretty briskly for several minutes then all fell to work trimming the old house for the family always dined together there on that day  i rode miles and mileses as ben says to get this fine bit and im going to hang it there as the last touch to the rigamadooning said charlie as he fastened a dull green branch to the chandelier in the front parlor  it isnt very pretty said rose who was trimming the chimneypiece with glossy holly sprays  never mind that its mistletoe and anyone who stands under it will get kissed whether they like it or not nows your time ladies  answered the saucy prince keeping his place and looking sentimentally at the girls who retired precipitately from the dangerous spot  you wont catch me said rose with great dignity  see if i dont  ive got my eye on phebe observed will in a patronising tone that made them all laugh  bless the dear i shant mind it a bit answered phebe with such a maternal air that wills budding gallantry was chilled to death  oh the mistletoe bough sang rose  oh the mistletoe bough echoed all the boys and the teasing ended in the plaintive ballad they all liked so well  there was plenty of time to try the new skates before dinner and then rose took her first lesson on the little bay which seemed to have frozen over for that express purpose she found tumbling down and getting up again warm work for a time but with six boys to teach her she managed at last to stand alone and satisfied with that success she refreshed herself with a dozen grand coasts on the amazon as her sled was called  ah that fatal colour it breaks my heart to see it croaked aunt myra as rose came down a little late with cheeks almost as ruddy as the holly berries on the wall and every curl as smooth as phebes careful hands could make it  im glad to see that alec allows the poor child to make herself pretty in spite of his absurd notions added aunt clara taking infinite satisfaction in the fact that roses blue silk dress had three frills on it  shes a very intelligent child and has a nice little manner of her own observed aunt jane with unusual affability for rose had just handed mac a screen to guard his eyes from the brilliant fire  if i had a daughter like that to show my jem when he gets home i should be a very proud and happy woman thought aunt jessie and then reproached herself for not being perfectly satisfied with her four brave lads  aunt plenty was too absorbed in the dinner to have an eye for anything else if she had not been she would have seen what an effect her new cap produced upon the boys the good lady owned that she did love a dressy cap and on this occasion her head gear was magnificent for the towering structure of lace was adorned with buff ribbons to such an extent that it looked as if a flock of yellow butterflies had settled on her dear old head when she trotted about the rooms the ruches quivered the little bows all stood erect and the streamers waved in the breeze so comically that it was absolutely necessary for archie to smother the brats in the curtains till they had had their first laugh out  uncle mac had brought fun see to dinner and it was a mercy he did for the elder lads found a vent for their merriment in joking the young chinaman on his improved appearance he was in american costume now with a cropped head and spoke remarkably good english after six months at school but for all that his yellow face and beady eyes made a curious contrast to the blonde campbells all about him will called him the typhoon meaning tycoon and the name stuck to him to his great disgust  aunt peace was brought down and set in the chair of state at table for she never failed to join the family on this day and sat smiling at them all like an embodiment of peace on earth uncle alec said as he took his place beside her while uncle mac supported aunt plenty at the other end  i ate hardly any breakfast and ive done everything i know to make myself extra hungry but i really dont think i can eat straight through unless i burst my buttons off whispered geordie to will as he surveyed the bounteous stores before him with a hopeless sigh  a fellow never knows what he can do till he tries answered will attacking his heapedup plate with an evident intention of doing his duty like a man  everybody knows what a christmas dinner is so we need waste no words in describing this one but hasten at once to tell what happened at the end of it the end by the way was so long in coming that the gas was lighted before dessert was over for a snow flurry had come on and the wintry daylight faded fast but that only made it all the jollier in the warm bright rooms full of happy souls everyone was very merry but archie seemed particularly uplifted so much so that charlie confided to rose that he was afraid the chief had been at the decanters  rose indignantly denied the insinuation for when healths were drunk in the good oldfashioned way to suit the elders she had observed that aunt jessies boys filled their glasses with water and had done the same herself in spite of the princes jokes about the rosy  but archie certainly was unusually excited and when someone remembered that it was the anniversary of uncle jems wedding and wished he was there to make a speech his son electrified the family by trying to do it for him it was rather incoherent and flowery as maiden speeches are apt to be but the end was considered superb for turning to his mother with a queer little choke in his voice he said that she deserved to be blessed with peace and plenty to be crowned with roses and ladslove and to receive the cargo of happiness sailing home to her in spite of wind or tide to add another jem to the family jewels  that allusion to the captain now on his return trip made mrs jessie sob in her napkin and set the boys cheering then as if that was not sensation enough archie suddenly dashed out of the room as if he had lost his wits  too bashful to stay and be praised began charlie excusing the peculiarities of his chief as in duty bound  phebe beckoned to him i saw her cried rose staring hard at the door  is it more presents coming asked jamie just as his brother reappeared looking more excited than ever  yes a present for mother and here it is roared archie flinging wide the door to let in a tall man who cried out  wheres my little woman the first kiss for her then the rest may come on as fast as they like  before the words were out of his mouth mrs jessie was halfhidden under his rough greatcoat and four boys were prancing about him clamouring for their turn  of course there was a joyful tumult for a time during which rose slipped into the window recess and watched what went on as if it were a chapter in a christmas story it was good to see bluff uncle jem look proudly at his tall son and fondly hug the little ones it was better still to see him shake his brothers hands as if he would never leave off and kiss all the sisters in a way that made even solemn aunt myra brighten up for a minute but it was best of all to see him finally established in grandfathers chair with his little woman beside him his three youngest boys in his lap and archie hovering over him like a largesized cherub that really was as charlie said a landscape to do ones heart good  all hearty and all here thank god said captain jem in the first pause that came as he looked about him with a grateful face  all but rose answered loyal little jamie remembering the absent  faith i forgot the child where is georges little girl asked the captain who had not seen her since she was a baby  youd better say alecs great girl said uncle mac who professed to be madly jealous of his brother  here i am sir and rose appeared from behind the curtains looking as if she had rather have stayed there  saint george germain how the mite has grown cried captain jem as he tumbled the boys out of his lap and rose to greet the tall girl like a gentleman as he was but somehow when he shook her hand it looked so small in his big one and her face reminded him so strongly of his dead brother that he was not satisfied with so cold a welcome and with a sudden softening of the keen eyes he took her up in his arms whispering with a rough cheek against her smooth one  god bless you child forgive me if i forgot you for a minute and be sure that not one of your kinsfolk is happier to see you here than uncle jem  that made it all right and when he set her down roses face was so bright it was evident that some spell had been used to banish the feeling of neglect that had kept her moping behind the curtain so long  that everyone sat round and heard all about the voyage home how the captain had set his heart on getting there in time to keep christmas how everything had conspired to thwart his plan and how at the very last minute he had managed to do it and had sent a telegram to archie bidding him keep the secret and be ready for his father at any moment for the ship got into another port and he might be late  then archie told how that telegram had burnt in his pocket all dinnertime how he had to take phebe into his confidence and how clever she was to keep the captain back till the speech was over and he could come in with effect  the elders would have sat and talked all the evening but the young folks were bent on having their usual christmas frolic so after an hour of pleasant chat they began to get restless and having consulted together in dumb show they devised a way to very effectually break up the family council  steve vanished and sooner than the boys imagined dandy could get himself up the skirl of the bagpipe was heard in the hall and the bonny piper came to lead clan campbell to the revel  draw it mild stevie my man ye play unco weel but ye mak a most infernal din cried uncle jem with his hands over his ears for this accomplishment was new to him and took him all aback as he expressed it  so steve droned out a highland reel as softly as he could and the boys danced it to a circle of admiring relations captain jem was a true sailor however and could not stand idle while anything lively was going on so when the pipers breath gave out he cut a splendid pigeonwing into the middle of the hall saying who can dance a fore and after and waiting for no reply began to whistle the air so invitingly that mrs jessie set to him laughing like a girl rose and charlie took their places behind and away went the four with a spirit and skill that inspired all the rest to cut in as fast as they could  that was a grand beginning and they had many another dance before anyone would own they were tired even fun see distinguished himself with aunt plenty whom he greatly admired as the stoutest lady in the company plumpness being considered a beauty in his country the merry old soul professed herself immensely flattered by his admiration and the boys declared she set her cap at him else he would never have dared to catch her under the mistletoe and rising on the tips of his own toes gallantly salute her fat cheek  how they all laughed at her astonishment and how funs little black eyes twinkled over this exploit charlie put him up to it and charlie was so bent on catching rose that he laid all sorts of pitfalls for her and bribed the other lads to help him but rose was wideawake and escaped all his snares professing great contempt for such foolish customs poor phebe did not fare so well and archie was the only one who took a base advantage of her as she stood innocently offering tea to aunt myra whom she happened to meet just under the fatal bough if his fathers arrival had not rather upset him i doubt if the dignified chief would have done it for he apologized at once in the handsomest manner and caught the tray that nearly dropped from phebes hands  jamie boldly invited all the ladies to come and salute him and as for uncle jem he behaved as if the entire room was a grove of mistletoe uncle alec slyly laid a bit of it on aunt peaces cap and then softly kissed her which little joke seemed to please her very much for she liked to have part in all the home pastimes and alec was her favourite nephew  charlie alone failed to catch his shy bird and the oftener she escaped the more determined he was to ensnare her when every other wile had been tried in vain he got archie to propose a game with forfeits  i understand that dodge thought rose and was on her guard so carefully that not one among the pile soon collected belonged to her  now let us redeem them and play something else said will quite unconscious of the deeplylaid plots all about him  one more round and then we will answered the prince who had now baited his trap anew  just as the question came to rose jamies voice was heard in the hall crying distressfully oh come quick quick rose started up missed the question and was greeted with a general cry of forfeit forfeit  in which the little traitor came to join  now ive got her thought the young rascal exulting in his funloving soul  now im lost thought rose as she gave up her pincushion with a sternly defiant look that would have daunted anyone but the reckless prince in fact it made even him think twice and resolve to let rose off easy she had been so clever  heres a very pretty pawn and what shall be done to redeem it asked steve holding the pincushion over charlies head for he had insisted on being judge and kept that for the last  fine or superfine  super  hum well she shall take old mac under the mistletoe and kiss him prettily wont he be mad though and this bad boy chuckled over the discomfort he had caused two harmless beings  there was an impressive pause among the young folks in their corner for they all knew that mac would be mad since he hated nonsense of this sort and had gone to talk with the elders when the game began at this moment he was standing before the fire listening to a discussion between his uncles and his father looking as wise as a young owl and blissfully unconscious of the plots against him  charlie expected that rose would say i wont therefore he was rather astonished not to say gratified when after a look at the victim she laughed suddenly and going up to the group of gentlemen drew her uncle mac under the mistletoe and surprised him with a hearty kiss  thank you my dear said the innocent gentleman looking much pleased at the unexpected honour  oh come thats not fair began charlie but rose cut him short by saying as she made him a fine courtesy  you said old mac and though it was very disrespectful i did it that was your last chance sir and youve lost it  he certainly had for as he spoke rose pulled down the mistletoe and threw it into the fire while the boys jeered at the crestfallen prince and exalted quickwitted rose to the skies  whats the joke asked young mac waked out of a brown study by the laughter in which the elders joined  but there was a regular shout when the matter having been explained to him mac took a meditative stare at rose through his goggles and said in a philosophical tone well i dont think i should have minded much if she had done it  that tickled the lads immensely and nothing but the appearance of a slight refection would have induced them to stop chaffing the poor worm who could not see anything funny in the beautiful resignation he had shown on this trying occasion  soon after this the discovery of jamie curled up in the sofa corner as sound asleep as a dormouse suggested the propriety of going home and a general move was made  they were all standing about the hall lingering over the goodnights when the sound of a voice softly singing sweet home made them pause and listen it was phebe poor little phebe who never had a home never knew the love of father or mother brother or sister who stood all alone in the wide world yet was not sad nor afraid but took her bits of happiness gratefully and sung over her work without a thought of discontent  i fancy the happy family standing there together remembered this and felt the beauty of it for when the solitary voice came to the burden of its song other voices took it up and finished it so sweetly that the old house seemed to echo the word home in the ears of both the orphan girls who had just spent their first christmas under its hospitable roof    chapter 21 a scare  brother alec you surely dont mean to allow that child to go out such a bitter cold day as this said mrs myra looking into the study where the doctor sat reading his paper one february morning  why not if a delicate invalid like yourself can bear it surely my hearty girl can especially as she is dressed for cold weather  answered dr alec with provoking confidence  but you have no idea how sharp the wind is i am chilled to the very marrow of my bones answered aunt myra chafing the end of her purple nose with her sombre glove  i dont doubt it maam if you will wear crape and silk instead of fur and flannel rosy goes out in all weathers and will be none the worse for an hours brisk skating  well i warn you that you are trifling with the childs health and depending too much on the seeming improvement she has made this year she is a delicate creature for all that and will drop away suddenly at the first serious attack as her poor mother did croaked aunt myra with a despondent wag of the big bonnet  ill risk it answered dr alec knitting his brows as he always did when any allusion was made to that other rose  mark my words you will repent it and with that awful prophecy aunt myra departed like a black shadow  now it must be confessed that among the doctors failings and he had his share was a very masculine dislike of advice which was thrust upon him unasked he always listened with respect to the greataunts and often consulted mrs jessie but the other three ladies tried his patience sorely by constant warnings complaints and counsels aunt myra was an especial trial and he always turned contrary the moment she began to talk he could not help it and often laughed about it with comic frankness here now was a sample of it for he had just been thinking that rose had better defer her run till the wind went down and the sun was warmer but aunt myra spoke and he could not resist the temptation to make light of her advice and let rose brave the cold he had no fear of its harming her for she went out every day and it was a great satisfaction to him to see her run down the avenue a minute afterward with her skates on her arm looking like a rosyfaced esquimaux in her sealskin suit as she smiled at aunt myra stalking along as solemnly as a crow  i hope the child wont stay out long for this wind is enough to chill the marrow in younger bones than myras thought dr alec half an hour later as he drove toward the city to see the few patients he had consented to take for old acquaintance sake  the thought returned several times that morning for it was truly a bitter day and in spite of his bearskin coat the doctor shivered but he had great faith in roses good sense and it never occurred to him that she was making a little casabianca of herself with the difference of freezing instead of burning at her post  you see mac had made an appointment to meet her at a certain spot and have a grand skating bout as soon as the few lessons he was allowed were over she had promised to wait for him and did so with a faithfulness that cost her dear because mac forgot his appointment when the lessons were done and became absorbed in a chemical experiment till a general combustion of gases drove him out of his laboratory then he suddenly remembered rose and would gladly have hurried away to her but his mother forbade his going out for the sharp wind would hurt his eyes  she will wait and wait mother for she always keeps her word and i told her to hold on till i came explained mac with visions of a shivering little figure watching on the windy hilltop  of course your uncle wont let her go out such a day as this if he does she will have the sense to come here for you or to go home again when you dont appear said aunt jane returning to her watts on the mind  i wish steve would just cut up and see if shes there since i cant go began mac anxiously  steve wont stir a peg thank you hes got his own toes to thaw out and wants his dinner answered dandy just in from school and wrestling impatiently with his boots  so mac resigned himself and rose waited dutifully till dinnertime assured her that her waiting was in vain she had done her best to keep warm had skated till she was tired and hot then stood watching others till she was chilled tried to get up a glow again by trotting up and down the road but failed to do so and finally cuddled disconsolately under a pinetree to wait and watch when she at length started for home she was benumbed with cold and could hardly make her way against the wind that buffeted the frostbitten rose most unmercifully  dr alec was basking in the warmth of the study fire after his drive when the sound of a stifled sob made him hurry to the door and look anxiously into the hall rose lay in a shivering bunch near the register with her things half off wringing her hands and trying not to cry with the pain returning warmth brought to her halffrozen fingers  my darling what is it and uncle alec had her in his arms in a minute  mac didnt come i cant get warm the fire makes me ache and with a long shiver rose burst out crying while her teeth chattered and her poor little nose was so blue it made ones heart ache to see it  in less time than it takes to tell it dr alec had her on the sofa rolled up in the bearskin coat with phebe rubbing her cold feet while he rubbed the aching hands and aunt plenty made a comfortable hot drink and aunt peace sent down her own footwarmer and embroidered blanket for the dear  full of remorseful tenderness uncle alec worked over his new patient till she declared she was all right again he would not let her get up to dinner but fed her himself and then forgot his own while he sat watching her fall into a drowse for aunt plentys cordial made her sleepy  she lay so several hours for the drowse deepened into a heavy sleep and uncle alec still at his post saw with growing anxiety that a feverish colour began to burn in her cheeks that her breathing was quick and uneven and now and then she gave a little moan as if in pain suddenly she woke up with a start and seeing aunt plenty bending over her put out her arms like a sick child saying wearily  please could i go to bed  the best place for you deary take her right up alec ive got the hot water ready and after a nice bath she shall have a cup of my sage tea and be rolled up in blankets to sleep off her cold answered the old lady cheerily as she bustled away to give orders  are you in pain darling asked uncle alec as he carried her up  my side aches when i breathe and i feel stiff and queer but it isnt bad so dont be troubled uncle whispered rose with a little hot hand against his cheek  but the poor doctor did look troubled and had cause to do so for just then rose tried to laugh at dolly charging into the room with a warmingpan but could not for the sharp pain took her breath away and made her cry out  pleurisy sighed aunt plenty from the depths of the bathtub  pewmonia groaned dolly burrowing among the bedclothes with the longhandled pan as if bent on fishing up that treacherous disease  oh is it bad asked phebe nearly dropping a pail of hot water in her dismay for she knew nothing of sickness and dollys suggestion had a peculiarly dreadful sound to her  hush ordered the doctor in a tone that silenced all further predictions and made everyone work with a will  make her as comfortable as you can and when she is in her little bed ill come and say goodnight he added when the bath was ready and the blankets browning nicely before the fire  then he went away to talk quite cheerfully to aunt peace about its being only a chill after which he tramped up and down the hall pulling his beard and knitting his brows sure signs of great inward perturbation  i thought it would be too good luck to get through the year without a downfall confound my perversity why couldnt i take myras advice and keep rose at home its not fair that the poor child should suffer for my sinful overconfidence she shall not suffer for it pneumonia indeed i defy it and he shook his fist in the ugly face of an indian idol that happened to be before him as if that particularly hideous god had some spite against his own little goddess  in spite of his defiance his heart sunk when he saw rose again for the pain was worse and the bath and blankets the warmingpan and pipinghot sage tea were all in vain for several hours there was no rest for the poor child and all manner of gloomy forebodings haunted the minds of those who hovered about her with faces full of the tenderest anxiety  in the midst of the worst paroxysm charlie came to leave a message from his mother and was met by phebe coming despondently downstairs with a mustard plaster that had brought no relief  what the dickens is the matter you look as dismal as a tombstone he said as she held up her hand to stop his lively whistling  miss rose is dreadful sick  the deuce she is  dont swear mr charlie she really is and its mr macs fault and phebe told the sad tale in a few sharp words for she felt at war with the entire race of boys at that moment  ill give it to him make your mind easy about that said charlie with an ominous doubling up of his fist but rose isnt dangerously ill is she he added anxiously as aunt plenty was seen to trot across the upper hall shaking a bottle violently as she went  oh but she is though the doctor dont say much but he dont call it a chill any more its pleurisy now and im so afraid it will be pewmonia tomorrow answered phebe with a despairing glance at the plaster  charlie exploded into a stifled laugh at the new pronunciation of pneumonia to phebes great indignation  how can you have the heart to do it and she in such horrid pain hark to that and then laugh if you darst she said with a tragic gesture and her black eyes full of fire  charlie listened and heard little moans that went to his heart and made his face as sober as phebes o uncle please stop the pain and let me rest a minute dont tell the boys i wasnt brave i try to bear it but its so sharp i cant help crying  neither could charlie when he heard the broken voice say that but boylike he wouldnt own it and said pettishly as he rubbed his sleeve across his eyes  dont hold that confounded thing right under my nose the mustard makes my eyes smart  dont see how it can when it hasnt any more strength in it than meal the doctor said so and im going to get some better began phebe not a bit ashamed of the great tears that were bedewing the condemned plaster  ill go and charlie was off like a shot glad of an excuse to get out of sight for a few minutes  when he came back all inconvenient emotion had been disposed of and having delivered a box of the hottest mustard procurable for money he departed to blow up mac that being his next duty in his opinion he did it so energetically and thoroughly that the poor worm was cast into the depths of remorseful despair and went to bed that evening feeling that he was an outcast from among men and bore the mark of cain upon his brow  thanks to the skill of the doctor and the devotion of his helpers rose grew easier about midnight and all hoped that the worst was over phebe was making tea by the study fire for the doctor had forgotten to eat and drink since rose was ill and aunt plenty insisted on his having a good cordial dish of tea after his exertions a tap on the window startled phebe and looking up she saw a face peering in she was not afraid for a second look showed her that it was neither ghost nor burglar but mac looking pale and wild in the wintry moonlight  come and let a fellow in he said in a low tone and when he stood in the hall he clutched phebes arm whispering gruffly how is rose  thanks be to goodness shes better answered phebe with a smile that was like broad sunshine to the poor lads anxious heart  and she will be all right again tomorrow  oh dear no dolly says shes sure to have rheumatic fever if she dont have noomonia answered phebe careful to pronounce the word rightly this time  down went macs face and remorse began to gnaw at him again as he gave a great sigh and said doubtfully  i suppose i couldnt see her  of course not at this time of night when we want her to go to sleep  mac opened his mouth to say something more when a sneeze came upon him unawares and a loud ah rash hoo awoke the echoes of the quiet house  why didnt you stop it said phebe reproachfully i dare say youve waked her up  didnt know it was coming just my luck groaned mac turning to go before his unfortunate presence did more harm  but a voice from the stairhead called softly mac come up rose wants to see you  up he went and found his uncle waiting for him  what brings you here at this hour my boy asked the doctor in a whisper  charlie said it was all my fault and if she died id killed her i couldnt sleep so i came to see how she was and no one knows it but steve he said with such a troubled face and voice that the doctor had not the heart to blame him  before he could say anything more a feeble voice called mac and with a hasty stay a minute just to please her and then slip away for i want her to sleep the doctor led him into the room  the face on the pillow looked very pale and childish and the smile that welcomed mac was very faint for rose was spent with pain yet could not rest till she had said a word of comfort to her cousin  i knew your funny sneeze and i guessed that you came to see how i did though it is very late dont be worried im better now and it is my fault i was ill not yours for i neednt have been so silly as to wait in the cold just because i said i would  mac hastened to explain to load himself with reproaches and to beg her not to die on any account for charlies lecture had made a deep impression on the poor boys mind  i didnt know there was any danger of my dying and rose looked up at him with a solemn expression in her great eyes  oh i hope not but people do sometimes go suddenly you know and i couldnt rest till id asked you to forgive me faltered mac thinking that rose looked very like an angel already with the golden hair loose on the pillow and the meekness of suffering on her little white face  i dont think i shall die uncle wont let me but if i do remember i forgave you  she looked at him with a tender light in her eyes and seeing how pathetic his dumb grief was she added softly drawing his head down i wouldnt kiss you under the mistletoe but i will now for i want you to be sure i do forgive and love you just the same  that quite upset poor mac he could only murmur his thanks and get out of the room as fast as possible to grope his way to the couch at the far end of the hall and lie there till he fell asleep worn out with trying not to make a baby of himself    chapter 22 something to do  whatever danger there might have been from the effects of that sudden chill it was soon over though of course aunt myra refused to believe it and dr alec cherished his girl with redoubled vigilance and tenderness for months afterward rose quite enjoyed being sick because as soon as the pain ended the fun began and for a week or two she led the life of a little princess secluded in the bower while every one served amused and watched over her in the most delightful manner but the doctor was called away to see an old friend who was dangerously ill and then rose felt like a young bird deprived of its mothers sheltering wing especially on one afternoon when the aunts were taking their naps and the house was very still within while snow fell softly without  ill go and hunt up phebe she is always nice and busy and likes to have me help her if dolly is out of the way we can make caramels and surprise the boys when they come rose said to herself as she threw down her book and felt ready for society of some sort  she took the precaution to peep through the slide before she entered the kitchen for dolly allowed no messing when she was round but the coast was clear and no one but phebe appeared sitting at the table with her head on her arms apparently asleep rose was just about to wake her with a boo when she lifted her head dried her wet eyes with her blue apron and fell to work with a resolute face on something she was evidently much interested in rose could not make out what it was and her curiosity was greatly excited for phebe was writing with a sputtering pen on some bits of brown paper apparently copying something from a little book  i must know what the dear thing is about and why she cried and then set her lips tight and went to work with all her might thought rose forgetting all about the caramels and going round to the door she entered the kitchen saying pleasantly  phebe i want something to do cant you let me help you about anything or shall i be in the way  oh dear no miss i always love to have you round when things are tidy what would you like to do answered phebe opening a drawer as if about to sweep her own affairs out of sight but rose stopped her exclaiming like a curious child  let me see what is it i wont tell if youd rather not have dolly know  im only trying to study a bit but im so stupid i dont get on much  answered the girl reluctantly permitting her little mistress to examine the poor contrivances she was trying to work with  a broken slate that had blown off the roof an inch or two of pencil an old almanac for a reader several bits of brown or yellow paper ironed smoothly and sewn together for a copybook and the copies sundry receipts written in aunt plentys neat hand these with a small bottle of ink and a rusty pen made up phebes outfit and it was little wonder that she did not get on in spite of the patient persistence that dried the desponding tears and drove along the sputtering pen with a will  you may laugh if you want to miss rose i know my things are queer and thats why i hide em but i dont mind since youve found me out and i aint a bit ashamed except of being so backward at my age said phebe humbly though her cheeks grew redder as she washed out some crooked capitals with a tear or two not yet dried upon the slate  laugh at you i feel more like crying to think what a selfish girl i am to have loads of books and things and never remember to give you some why didnt you come and ask me and not go struggling along alone in this way it was very wrong of you phebe and ill never forgive you if you do so again answered rose with one hand on phebes shoulder while the other gently turned the leaves of the poor little copybook  i didnt like to ask for anything more when you are so good to me all the time miss dear began phebe looking up with grateful eyes  o you proud thing just as if it wasnt fun to give away and i had the best of it now see here ive got a plan and you mustnt say no or i shall scold i want something to do and im going to teach you all i know it wont take long and rose laughed as she put her arm around phebes neck and patted the smooth dark head with the kind little hand that so loved to give  it would be just heavenly and phebes face shone at the mere idea but fell again as she added wistfully only im afraid i ought not to let you do it miss rose it will take time and maybe the doctor wouldnt like it  he didnt want me to study much but he never said a word about teaching and i dont believe he will mind a bit anyway we can try it till he comes so pack up your things and go right to my room and well begin this very day id truly like to do it and well have nice times see if we dont cried rose eagerly  it was a pretty sight to see phebe bundle her humble outfit into her apron and spring up as if the desire of her heart had suddenly been made a happy fact to her it was a still prettier sight to see rose run gaily on before smiling like a good fairy as she beckoned to the other singing as she went      the way into my parlour is up a winding stair      and many are the curious things ill show you when youre there      will you will you walk in phebe dear  oh wont i answered phebe fervently adding as they entered the bower you are the dearest spider that ever was and im the happiest fly  im going to be very strict so sit down in that chair and dont say a word till school is ready to open ordered rose delighted with the prospect of such a useful and pleasant something to do  so phebe sat demurely in her place while her new teacher laid forth books and slates a pretty inkstand and a little globe hastily tore a bit off her big sponge sharpened pencils with more energy than skill and when all was ready gave a prance of satisfaction that set the pupil laughing  now the school is open and i shall hear you read so that i may know in which class to put you miss moore began rose with great dignity as she laid a book before her scholar and sat down in the easy chair with a long rule in her hand  phebe did pretty well only tripping now and then over a hard word and pronouncing identical identickle in a sober way that tickled rose though never a smile betrayed her the spelling lesson which followed was rather discouraging phebes ideas of geography were very vague and grammar was nowhere though the pupil protested that she tried so hard to talk nice like educated folks that dolly called her a stuckup piece who didnt know her place  dollys an old goose so dont you mind her for she will say nater vittles and doos as long as she lives and insist that they are right you do talk very nicely phebe ive observed it and grammar will help you and show you some things are right and others aint are not i mean added rose correcting herself and feeling that she must mind her own parts of speech if she was to serve as an example for phebe  when the arithmetic came the little teacher was surprised to find her scholar quicker in some things than herself for phebe had worked away at the columns in the butchers and bakers books till she could add so quickly and correctly that rose was amazed and felt that in this branch the pupil would soon excel the teacher if she kept on at the same pace her praise cheered phebe immensely and they went bravely on both getting so interested that time flew unheeded till aunt plenty appeared exclaiming as she stared at the two heads bent over one slate  bless my heart what is going on now  school aunty im teaching phebe and its great fun cried rose looking up with a bright face  but phebes was brighter though she added with a wistful look  maybe i ought to have asked leave first only when miss rose proposed this i was so happy i forgot to shall i stop maam  of course not child im glad to see you fond of your book and to find rose helping you along my blessed mother used to sit at work with her maids about her teaching them many a useful thing in the good old fashion thats gone by now only dont neglect your work dear or let the books interfere with the duties  as aunt plenty spoke with her kind old face beaming approvingly upon the girls phebe glanced at the clock saw that it pointed to five knew that dolly would soon be down expecting to find preparations for supper under way and hastily dropping her pencil she jumped up saying  please can i go ill clear up after ive done my chores  school is dismissed answered rose and with a grateful thank you heaps and heaps phebe ran away singing the multiplication table as she set the tea ditto  that was the way it began and for a week the class of one went on with great pleasure and profit to all concerned for the pupil proved a bright one and came to her lessons as to a feast while the young teacher did her best to be worthy the high opinion held of her for phebe firmly believed that miss rose knew everything in the way of learning  of course the lads found out what was going on and chaffed the girls about the seminary as they called the new enterprise but they thought it a good thing on the whole kindly offered to give lessons in greek and latin gratis and decided among themselves that rose was a little trump to give the phebebird such a capital boost  rose herself had some doubts as to how it would strike her uncle and concocted a wheedlesome speech which should at once convince him that it was the most useful wholesome and delightful plan ever devised but she got no chance to deliver her address for dr alec came upon her so unexpectedly that it went out of her head entirely she was sitting on the floor in the library poring over a big book laid open in her lap and knew nothing of the longdesired arrival till two large warm hands met under her chin and gently turned her head back so that someone could kiss her heartily on either cheek while a fatherly voice said half reproachfully why is my girl brooding over a dusty encyclopedia when she ought to be running to meet the old gentleman who couldnt get on another minute without her  o uncle im so glad and so sorry why didnt you let us know what time youd be here or call out the minute you came havent i been homesick for you and now im so happy to have you back i could hug your dear old curly head off cried rose as the encyclopedia went down with a bang and she up with a spring that carried her into dr alecs arms to be kept there in the sort of embrace a man gives to the dearest creature the world holds for him  presently he was in his easy chair with rose upon his knee smiling up in his face and talking as fast as her tongue could go while he watched her with an expression of supreme content as he stroked the smooth round cheek or held the little hand in his rejoicing to see how rosy was the one how plump and strong the other  have you had a good time did you save the poor lady arent you glad to be home again with your girl to torment you  yes to all those questions now tell me what youve been at little sinner aunty plen says you want to consult me about some new and remarkable project which you have dared to start in my absence  she didnt tell you i hope  not a word more expect that you were rather doubtful how id take it and so wanted to fess yourself and get round me as you always try to do though you dont often succeed now then own up and take the consequences  so rose told about her school in her pretty earnest way dwelling on phebes hunger for knowledge and the delight it was to help her adding with a wise nod  and it helps me too uncle for she is so quick and eager i have to do my best or she will get ahead of me in some things today now she had the word cotton in a lesson and asked all about it and i was ashamed to find i really knew so little that i could only say that it was a plant that grew down south in a kind of a pod and was made into cloth thats what i was reading up when you came and tomorrow i shall tell her all about it and indigo too so you see it teaches me also and is as good as a general review of what ive learned in a pleasanter way than going over it alone  you artful little baggage thats the way you expect to get round me is it thats not studying i suppose  no sir its teaching and please i like it much better than having a good time by myself besides you know i adopted phebe and promised to be a sister to her so i am bound to keep my word am i not answered rose looking both anxious and resolute as she waited for her sentence  dr alec was evidently already won for rose had described the old slate and brown paper copybook with pathetic effect and the excellent man had not only decided to send phebe to school long before the story was done but reproached himself for forgetting his duty to one little girl in his love for another so when rose tried to look meek and failed utterly he laughed and pinched her cheek and answered in that genial way which adds such warmth and grace to any favour  i havent the slightest objection in the world in fact i was beginning to think i might let you go at your books again moderately since you are so well and this is an excellent way to try your powers phebe is a brave bright lass and shall have a fair chance in the world if we can give it to her so that if she ever finds her friends they need not be ashamed of her  i think she has found some already began rose eagerly  hey what has anyone turned up since ive been gone asked dr alec quickly for it was a firm belief in the family that phebe would prove to be somebody sooner or later  no her best friend turned up when you came home uncle answered rose with an approving pat adding gratefully i cant half thank you for being so good to my girl but she will because i know she is going to make a woman to be proud of shes so strong and true and loving  bless your dear heart i havent begun to do anything yet more shame to me but im going at it now and as soon as she gets on a bit she shall go to school as long as she likes how will that do for a beginning  it will be just heavenly as phebe says for it is the wish of her life to get lots of schooling and she will be too happy when i tell her may i please it will be so lovely to see the dear thing open her big eyes and clap her hands at the splendid news  no one shall have a finger in this nice little pie you shall do it all yourself only dont go too fast or make too many castles in the air my dear for time and patience must go into this pie of ours if it is to turn out well  yes uncle only when it is opened wont the birds begin to sing laughed rose taking a turn about the room as a vent for the joyful emotions that made her eyes shine all of a sudden she stopped and asked soberly  if phebe goes to school who will do her work im willing if i can  come here and ill tell you a secret dollys bones are getting so troublesome and her dear old temper so bad that the aunts have decided to pension her off and let her go and live with her daughter who has married very well i saw her this week and shed like to have her mother come so in the spring we shall have a grand change and get a new cook and chambergirl if any can be found to suit our honoured relatives  oh me how can i ever get on without phebe couldnt she stay just so i could see her id pay her board rather than have her go im so fond of her  how dr alec laughed at that proposal and how satisfied rose was when he explained that phebe was still to be her maid with no duties except such as she could easily perform between schoolhours  she is a proud creature for all her humble ways and even from us would not take a favour if she did not earn it somewhere so this arrangement makes it all square and comfortable you see and she will pay for the schooling by curling these goldilocks a dozen times a day if you let her  your plans are always so wise and kind thats why they work so well i suppose and why people let you do what you like with them i really dont see how other girls get along without an uncle alec answered rose with a sigh of pity for those who had missed so great a blessing  when phebe was told the splendid news she did not stand on her head with rapture as charlie prophesied she would but took it quietly because it was such a happy thing she had no words big and beautiful enough to thank them in she said but every hour of her day was brightened by this granted wish and dedicated to the service of those who gave it  her heart was so full of content that if overflowed in music and the sweet voice singing all about the house gave thanks so blithely that no other words were needed her willing feet were never tired of taking steps for those who had smoothed her way her skilful hands were always busy in some labour of love for them and on the face fast growing in comeliness there was an almost womanly expression of devotion which proved how well phebe had already learned one of lifes great lessons gratitude    chapter 23 peacemaking  steve i want you to tell me something said rose to dandy who was making faces at himself in the glass while he waited for an answer to the note he brought from his mother to aunt plenty  praps i will and praps i wont what is it  havent arch and charlie quarrelled  dare say we fellows are always having little rows you know i do believe a sty is coming on my starboard eye and steve affected to be absorbed in a survey of his yellow lashes  no that wont do i want to know all about it for im sure something more serious than a little row is the matter come please tell me stenie theres a dear  botheration you dont want me to turn telltale do you growled steve pulling his topknot as he always did when perplexed  yes i do was roses decided answer for she saw from his manner that she was right and determined to have the secret out of him if coaxing would do it i dont wish you to tell things to everyone of course but to me you may and you must because i have a right to know you boys need somebody to look after you and im going to do it for girls are nice peacemakers and know how to manage people uncle said so and he is never wrong  steve was about to indulge in a derisive hoot at the idea of her looking after them but a sudden thought restrained him and suggested a way in which he could satisfy rose and better himself at the same time  what will you give me if ill tell you every bit about it he asked with a sudden red in his cheeks and an uneasy look in his eyes for he was half ashamed of the proposition  what do you want and rose looked up rather surprised at his question  id like to borrow some money i shouldnt think of asking you only mac never has a cent since hes set up his old chemical shop where hell blow himself to bits some day and you and uncle will have the fun of putting him together again and steve tried to look as if the idea amused him  ill lend it to you with pleasure so tell away said rose bound to get at the secret  evidently much relieved by the promise steve set his topknot cheerfully erect again and briefly stated the case  as you say its all right to tell you but dont let the boys know i blabbed or prince will take my head off you see archie dont like some of the fellows charlie goes with and cuts em that makes prince mad and he holds on just to plague arch so they dont speak to one another if they can help it and thats the row  are those boys bad asked rose anxiously  guess not only rather wild they are older than our fellows but they like prince hes such a jolly boy sings so well dances jigs and breakdowns you know and plays any game thats going he beat morse at billiards and thats something to brag of for morse thinks he knows everything i saw the match and it was great fun  steve got quite excited over the prowess of charlie whom he admired immensely and tried to imitate rose did not know half the danger of such gifts and tastes as charlies but felt instinctively that something must be wrong if archie disapproved  if prince likes any billiardplaying boy better than archie i dont think much of his sense she said severely  of course he doesnt but you see charlie and arch are both as proud as they can be and wont give in i suppose arch is right but i dont blame charlie a bit for liking to be with the others sometimes they are such a jolly set and steve shook his head morally even while his eye twinkled over the memory of some of the exploits of the jolly set  oh dear me sighed rose i dont see what i can do about it but i wish the boys would make up for prince cant come to any harm with archie hes so good and sensible  thats the trouble arch preaches and prince wont stand it he told arch he was a prig and a parson and arch told him he wasnt a gentleman my boots werent they both mad though i thought for a minute theyd pitch into one another and have it out wish they had and not gone stalking round stiff and glum ever since mac and i settle our rows with a bat or so over the head and then we are all right  rose couldnt help laughing as steve sparred away at a fat sofapillow to illustrate his meaning and having given it several scientific whacks he pulled down his cuffs and smiled upon her with benign pity for her feminine ignorance of this summary way of settling a quarrel  what droll things boys are she said with a mixture of admiration and perplexity in her face which steve accepted as a compliment to his sex  were a pretty clever invention miss and you cant get on without us he answered with his nose in the air then taking a sudden plunge into business he added how about that bit of money you were going to lend me ive told now you pay up  of course i will how much do you want and rose pulled out her purse  could you spare five dollars i want to pay a little debt of honour that is rather pressing and steve put on a mannish air that was comical to see  arent all debts honourable asked innocent rose  yes of course but this is a bet i made and it ought to be settled up at once began steve finding it awkward to explain  oh dont bet its not right and i know your father wouldnt like it promise you wont do so again please promise and rose held fast the hand into which she had just put the money  well i wont its worried me a good deal but i was joked into it much obliged cousin im all right now and steve departed hastily  having decided to be a peacemaker rose waited for an opportunity and very soon it came  she was spending the day with aunt clara who had been entertaining some young guests and invited rose to meet them for she thought it high time her niece conquered her bashfulness and saw a little of society dinner was over and everyone had gone aunt clara was resting before going out to an evening party and rose was waiting for charlie to come and take her home  she sat alone in the elegant drawingroom feeling particularly nice and pretty for she had her best frock on a pair of gold bands her aunt had just given her and a tearose bud in her sash like the beautiful miss van tassel whom everyone admired she had spread out her little skirts to the best advantage and leaning back in a luxurious chair sat admiring her own feet in new slippers with rosettes almost as big as dahlias presently charlie came lounging in looking rather sleepy and queer rose thought on seeing her however he roused up and said with a smile that ended in a gape  i thought you were with mother so i took forty winks after i got those girls off now im at your service rosamunda whenever you like  you look as if your head ached if it does dont mind me im not afraid to run home alone its so early answered rose observing the flushed cheeks and heavy eyes of her cousin  i think i see myself letting you do it champagne always makes my headache but the air will set me up  why do you drink it then asked rose anxiously  cant help it when im host now dont you begin to lecture ive had enough of archies oldfashioned notions and i dont want any more  charlies tone was decidedly cross and his whole manner so unlike his usual merry goodnature that rose felt crushed and answered meekly  i wasnt going to lecture only when people like other people they cant bear to see them suffer pain  that brought charlie round at once for roses lips trembled a little though she tried to hide it by smelling the flower she pulled from her sash  im a regular bear and i beg your pardon for being so cross rosy he said in the old frank way that was so winning  i wish youd beg archies too and be good friends again you never were cross when he was your chum rose said looking up at him as he bent toward her from the low chimneypiece where he had been leaning his elbows  in an instant he stood as stiff and straight as a ramrod and the heavy eyes kindled with an angry spark as he said in his high and mighty manner  youd better not meddle with what you dont understand cousin  but i do understand and it troubles me very much to see you so cold and stiff to one another you always used to be together and now you hardly speak you are so ready to beg my pardon i dont see why you cant beg archies if you are in the wrong  im not this was so short and sharp that rose started and charlie added in a calmer but still very haughty tone  a gentleman always begs pardon when he has been rude to a lady but one man doesnt apologize to another man who has insulted him  oh my heart what a pepperpot thought rose and hoping to make him laugh she added slyly  i was not talking about men but boys and one of them a prince who ought to set a good example to his subjects  but charlie would not relent and tried to turn the subject by saying gravely as he unfastened the little gold ring from his watchguard  ive broken my word so i want to give this back and free you from the bargain im sorry but i think it a foolish promise and dont intend to keep it choose a pair of earrings to suit yourself as my forfeit you have a right to wear them now  no i can only wear one and that is no use for archie will keep his word im sure rose was so mortified and grieved at this downfall of her hopes that she spoke sharply and would not take the ring the deserter offered her  he shrugged his shoulders and threw it into her lap trying to look cool and careless but failing entirely for he was ashamed of himself and out of sorts generally rose wanted to cry but pride would not let her and being very angry she relieved herself by talk instead of tears looking pale and excited she rose out of her chair cast away the ring and said in a voice that she vainly tried to keep steady  you are not at all the boy i thought you were and i dont respect you one bit ive tried to help you be good but you wont let me and i shall not try any more you talk a great deal about being a gentleman but you are not for youve broken your word and i can never trust you again i dont wish you to go home with me id rather have mary goodnight  and with that last dreadful blow rose walked out of the room leaving charlie as much astonished as if one of his pet pigeons had flown in his face and pecked at him she was so seldom angry that when her temper did get the better of her it made a deep impression on the lads for it was generally a righteous sort of indignation at some injustice or wrongdoing not childish passion  her little thunderstorm cleared off in a sob or two as she put on her things in the entrycloset and when she emerged she looked the brighter for the shower a hasty goodnight to aunt clara now under the hands of the hairdresser and then she crept down to find mary the maid but mary was out so was the man and rose slipped away by the backdoor flattering herself that she had escaped the awkwardness of having charlie for escort  there she was mistaken however for the gate had hardly closed behind her when a wellknown tramp was heard and the prince was beside her saying in a tone of penitent politeness that banished roses wrath like magic  you neednt speak to me if you dont choose but i must see you safely home cousin  she turned at once put out her hand and answered heartily  i was the cross one please forgive me and lets be friends again  now that was better than a dozen sermons on the beauty of forgiveness and did charlie more good for it showed him how sweet humility was and proved that rose practised as she preached  he shook the hand warmly then drew it through his arm and said as if anxious to recover the good opinion with the loss of which he had been threatened  look here rosy ive put the ring back and im going to try again but you dont know how hard it is to stand being laughed at  yes i do ariadne plagues me every time i see her because i dont wear earrings after all the trouble i had getting ready for them  ah but her twaddle isnt half as bad as the chaffing i get it takes a deal of pluck to hold out when you are told you are tied to an apron string and all that sort of thing sighed charlie  i thought you had a deal of pluck as you call it the boys all say you are the bravest of the seven said rose  so i am about some things but i cannot bear to be laughed at  it is hard but if one is right wont that make it easier  not to me it might to a pious parson like arch  please dont call him names i guess he has what is called moral courage and you physical courage uncle explained the difference to me and moral is the best though often it doesnt look so said rose thoughtfully  charlie didnt like that and answered quickly i dont believe hed stand it any better than i do if he had those fellows at him  perhaps thats why he keeps out of their way and wants you to  rose had him there and charlie felt it but would not give in just yet though he was going fast for somehow in the dark he seemed to see things clearer than in the light and found it very easy to be confidential when it was only rose  if he was my brother now hed have some right to interfere began charlie in an injured tone  i wish he was cried rose  so do i answered charlie and then they both laughed at his inconsistency  the laugh did them good and when prince spoke again it was in a different tone pensive not proud nor perverse  you see its hard upon me that i have no brothers and sisters the others are better off and neednt go abroad for chums if they dont like i am all alone and id be thankful even for a little sister  rose thought that very pathetic and overlooking the uncomplimentary word even in that last sentence she said with a timid sort of earnestness that conquered her cousin at once  play i was a little sister i know im silly but perhaps im better than nothing and id dearly love to do it  so should i and we will for you are not silly my dear but a very sensible girl we all think and im proud to have you for a sister there now and charlie looked down at the curly head bobbing along beside him with real affection in his face  rose gave a skip of pleasure and laid one sealskin mitten over the other on his arm as she said happily  thats so nice of you now you neednt be lonely any more and ill try to fill archies place till he comes back for i know he will as soon as you let him  well i dont mind telling you that while he was my mate i never missed brothers and sisters or wanted anyone else but since he cast me off ill be hanged if i dont feel as forlorn as old crusoe before friday turned up  this burst of confidence confirmed rose in her purpose of winning charlies mentor back to him but she said no more contented to have done so well they parted excellent friends and prince went home wondering why a fellow didnt mind saying things to a girl or woman which they would die before theyd own to another fellow  rose also had some sage reflections upon the subject and fell asleep thinking that there were a great many curious things in this world and feeling that she was beginning to find out some of them  next day she trudged up the hill to see archie and having told him as much as she thought best about her talk with charlie begged him to forget and forgive  ive been thinking that perhaps i ought to though i am in the right im no end fond of charlie and hes the besthearted lad alive but he cant say no and that will play the mischief with him if he does not take care said archie in his grave kind way  while father was home i was very busy with him so prince got into a set i dont like they try to be fast and think its manly and they flatter him and lead him on to do all sorts of things play for money and bet and loaf about i hate to have him do so and tried to stop it but went to work the wrong way so we got into a mess  he is all ready to make up if you dont say much for he owned to me he was wrong but i dont think he will own it to you in words began rose  i dont care for that if hell just drop those rowdies and come back ill hold my tongue and not preach i wonder if he owes those fellows money and so doesnt like to break off till he can pay it i hope not but dont dare to ask though perhaps steve knows hes always after prince mores the pity and archie looked anxious  i think steve does know for he talked about debts of honour the day i gave him  there rose stopped short and turned scarlet  but archie ordered her to fess and had the whole story in five minutes for none dared disobey the chief he completed her affliction by putting a fivedollar bill into her pocket by main force looking both indignant and resolute as he said  never do so again but send steve to me if he is afraid to go to his father charlie had nothing to do with that he wouldnt borrow a penny of a girl dont think it but thats the harm he does steve who adores him and tries to be like him in all things dont say a word ill make it all right and no one shall blame you  oh me i always make trouble by trying to help and then letting out the wrong thing sighed rose much depressed by her slip of the tongue  archie comforted her with the novel remark that it was always best to tell the truth and made her quite cheerful by promising to heal the breach with charlie as soon as possible  he kept his word so well that the very next afternoon as rose looked out of the window she beheld the joyful spectacle of archie and prince coming up the avenue arminarm as of old talking away as if to make up for the unhappy silence of the past weeks  rose dropped her work hurried to the door and opening it wide stood there smiling down upon them so happily that the faces of the lads brightened as they ran up the steps eager to show that all was well with them  heres our little peacemaker said archie shaking hands with vigour  but charlie added with a look that made rose very proud and happy and my little sister    chapter 24 which  uncle i have discovered what girls are made for said rose the day after the reconciliation of archie and the prince  well my dear what is it asked dr alec who was planking the deck as he called his daily promenade up and down the hall  to take care of boys answered rose quite beaming with satisfaction as she spoke phebe laughed when i told her and said she thought girls had better learn to take care of themselves first but thats because she hasnt got seven boycousins as i have  she is right nevertheless rosy and so are you for the two things go together and in helping seven lads you are unconsciously doing much to improve one lass said dr alec stopping to nod and smile at the brightfaced figure resting on the old bamboo chair after a lively game of battledore and shuttlecock in place of a run which a storm prevented  am i im glad of that but really uncle i do feel as if i must take care of the boys for they come to me in all sorts of troubles and ask advice and i like it so much only i dont always know what to do and im going to consult you privately and then surprise them with my wisdom  all right my dear whats the first worry i see you have something on your little mind so come and tell uncle  rose put her arm in his and pacing to and fro told him all about charlie asking what she could do to keep him straight and be a real sister to him  could you make up your mind to go and stay with aunt clara a month  asked the doctor when she ended  yes sir but i shouldnt like it do you really want me to go  the best cure for charlie is a daily dose of rose water or rose and water or rose and water will you go and see that he takes it laughed dr alec  you mean that if im there and try to make it pleasant he will stay at home and keep out of mischief  exactly  but could i make it pleasant he would want the boys  no danger but hed have the boys for they swarm after you like bees after their queen havent you found that out  aunt plen often says they never used to be here half so much before i came but i never thought i made the difference it seemed so natural to have them round  little modesty doesnt know what a magnet she is but she will find it out some day and the doctor softly stroked the cheek that had grown rosy with pleasure at the thought of being so much loved now you see if i move the magnet to aunt claras the lads will go there as sure as iron to steel and charlie will be so happy at home he wont care for these mischievous mates of his i hope added the doctor well knowing how hard it was to wean a seventeenyearold boy from his first taste of what is called seeing life which alas often ends in seeing death  ill go uncle right away aunt clara is always asking me and will be glad to get me i shall have to dress and dine late and see lots of company and be very fashionable but ill try not to let it hurt me and if i get in a puzzle or worried about anything i can run to you  answered rose goodwill conquering timidity  so it was decided and without saying much about the real reason for this visit rose was transplanted to aunt claras feeling that she had a work to do and very eager to do it well  dr alec was right about the bees for the boys did follow their queen and astonished mrs clara by their sudden assiduity in making calls dropping in to dinner and getting up evening frolics charlie was a devoted host and tried to show his gratitude by being very kind to his little sister for he guessed why she came and his heart was touched by her artless endeavours to help him be good  rose often longed to be back in the old house with the simpler pleasures and more useful duties of the life there but having made up her mind in spite of phebe that girls were made to take care of boys here motherly little soul found much to enjoy in the new task she had undertaken  it was a pretty sight to see the one earnest sweetfaced girl among the flock of tall lads trying to understand to help and please them with a patient affection that worked many a small miracle unperceived slang rough manners and careless habits were banished or bettered by the presence of a little gentlewoman and all the manly virtues cropping up were encouraged by the hearty admiration bestowed upon them by one whose good opinion all valued more than they confessed while rose tried to imitate the good qualities she praised in them to put away her girlish vanities and fears to be strong and just and frank and brave as well as modest kind and beautiful  this trial worked so well that when the month was over mac and steve demanded a visit in their turn and rose went feeling that she would like to hear grim aunt jane say as aunt clara did at parting i wish i could keep you all my life dear  after mac and steve had had their turn archie and company bore her away for some weeks and with them she was so happy she felt as if she would like to stay for ever if she could have uncle alec also  of course aunt myra could not be neglected and with secret despair rose went to the mausoleum as the boys called her gloomy abode fortunately she was very near home and dr alec dropped in so often that her visit was far less dismal than she expected between them they actually made aunt myra laugh heartily more than once and rose did her so much good by letting in the sunshine singing about the silent house cooking wholesome messes and amusing the old lady with funny little lectures on physiology that she forgot to take her pills and gave up mums elixir because she slept so well after the long walks and drives she was beguiled into taking that she needed no narcotic  so the winter flew rapidly away and it was may before rose was fairly settled again at home they called her the monthly rose because she had spent a month with each of the aunts and left such pleasant memories of bloom and fragrance behind her that all wanted the family flower back again  dr alec rejoiced greatly over his recovered treasure but as the time drew near when his year of experiment ended he had many a secret fear that rose might like to make her home for the next twelve month with aunt jessie or even aunt clara for charlies sake he said nothing but waited with much anxiety for the day when the matter should be decided and while he waited he did his best to finish as far as possible the task he had begun so well  rose was very happy now being out nearly all day enjoying the beautiful awakening of the world for spring came bright and early as if anxious to do its part the old horsechestnuts budded round her windows green things sprung up like magic in the garden under her hands hardy flowers bloomed as fast as they could the birds sang blithely overhead and every day a chorus of pleasant voices cried good morning cousin isnt it jolly weather  no one remembered the date of the eventful conversation which resulted in the doctors experiment no one but himself at least so when the aunts were invited to tea one saturday they came quite unsuspiciously and were all sitting together having a social chat when brother alec entered with two photographs in his hand  do you remember that he said showing one to aunt clara who happened to be nearest  yes indeed it is very like her when she came quite her sad unchildlike expression and thin little face with the big dark eyes  the picture was passed round and all agreed that it was very like rose a year ago this point being settled the doctor showed the second picture which was received with great approbation and pronounced a charming likeness  it certainly was and a striking contrast to the first one for it was a blooming smiling face full of girlish spirit and health with no sign of melancholy though the soft eyes were thoughtful and the lines about the lips betrayed a sensitive nature  dr alec set both photographs on the chimneypiece and falling back a step or two surveyed them with infinite satisfaction for several minutes then wheeled round saying briefly as he pointed to the two faces  time is up how do you think my experiment has succeeded ladies  bless me so it is cried aunt plenty dropping a stitch in her surprise  beautifully dear answered aunt peace smiling entire approval  she certainly has improved but appearances are deceitful and she had no constitution to build upon croaked aunt myra  i am willing to allow that as far as mere health goes the experiment is a success graciously observed aunt jane unable to forget roses kindness to her mac  so am i and ill go farther for i really do believe alec has done wonders for the child she will be a beauty in two or three years  added aunt clara feeling that she could say nothing better than that  i always knew he would succeed and im so glad you all allow it for he deserves more credit than you know and more praise than he will ever get cried aunt jessie clapping her hands with an enthusiasm that caused jamies little red stocking to wave like a triumphal banner in the air  dr alec made them a splendid bow looking much gratified and then said soberly  thank you now the question is shall i go on for this is only the beginning none of you know the hindrances ive had the mistakes ive made the study ive given the case and the anxiety ive often felt sister myra is right is one thing rose is a delicate creature quick to flourish in the sunshine and as quick to droop without it she has no special weakness but inherits her mothers sensitive nature and needs the wisest tenderest care to keep a very ardent little soul from wearing out a finely organised little body i think i have found the right treatment and with you to help me i believe we may build up a lovely and a noble woman who will be a pride and comfort to us all  there dr alec stopped to get his breath for he had spoken very earnestly and his voice got a little husky over the last words a gentle murmur from the aunts seemed to encourage him and he went on with an engaging smile for the good man was slyly trying to win all the ladies to vote for him when the time came  now i dont wish to be selfish or arbitrary because i am her guardian and i shall leave rose free to choose for herself we all want her and if she likes to make her home with any of you rather than with me she shall do so in fact i encouraged her visits last winter that she might see what we can all offer her and judge where she will be happiest is not that the fairest way will you agree to abide by her choice as i do  yes we will said all the aunts in quite a flutter of excitement at the prospect of having rose for a whole year  good she will be here directly and then we will settle the question for another year a most important year mind you for she has got a good start and will blossom rapidly now if all goes well with her so i beg of you dont undo my work but deal very wisely and gently with my little girl for if any harm come to her i think it would break my heart  as he spoke dr alec turned his back abruptly and affected to be examining the pictures again but the aunts understood how dear the child was to the solitary man who had loved her mother years ago and who now found his happiness in cherishing the little rose who was so like her the good ladies nodded and sighed and telegraphed to one another that none of them would complain if not chosen or ever try to rob brother alec of his hearts delight as the boys called rose  just then a pleasant sound of happy voices came up from the garden and smiles broke out on all serious faces dr alec turned at once saying as he threw back his head there she is now for it  the cousins had been amaying and soon came flocking in laden with the spoils  here is our bonny scotch rose with all her thorns about her said dr alec surveying her with unusual pride and tenderness as she went to show aunt peace her basket full of early flowers fresh leaves and curious lichens  leave your clutter in the hall boys and sit quietly down if you choose to stop here for we are busy said aunt plenty shaking her finger at the turbulent clan who were bubbling over with the jollity born of spring sunshine and healthy exercise  of course we choose to stay wouldnt miss our saturday high tea for anything said the chief as he restored order among his men with a nod a word and an occasional shake  what is up a courtmartial asked charlie looking at the assembled ladies with affected awe and real curiosity for these faces betrayed that some interesting business was afloat  dr alec explained in a few words which he made as brief and calm as he could but the effect was exciting nevertheless for each of the lads began at once to bribe entice and wheedle our cousin to choose his home  you really ought to come to us for mothers sake as a relish you know for she must be perfectly satiated with boys began archie using the strongest argument he could think of at the moment  oh do well never slam or bounce at you or call you fraid cat if you only will besought geordie and will distorting their countenances in the attempt to smile with overpowering sweetness  and ill always wash my hands fore i touch you and you shall be my dolly cause pokeys gone away and ill love you hard cried jamie clinging to her with his chubby face full of affection  brothers and sister ought to live together especially when the brother needs some one to make home pleasant for him added charlie with the wheedlesome tone and look that rose always found so difficult to resist  you had her longest and its our turn now mac needs her more than you do prince for shes the light of his eyes he says come rose choose us and ill never use the musky pomade you hate again as long as i live said steve with his most killing air as he offered this noble sacrifice  mac peered wistfully over his goggles saying in an unusually wideawake and earnest way    do cousin then we can study chemistry together my experiments dont blow up very often now and the gases arent at all bad when you get used to them  rose meantime had stood quite still with the flowers dropping from her hands as her eyes went from one eager face to another while smiles rippled over her own at the various enticements offered her during the laugh that followed macs handsome proposition she looked at her uncle whose eyes were fixed on her with an expression of love and longing that went to her heart  ah yes she thought he wants me most ive often longed to give him something that he wished for very much and now i can  so when at a sudden gesture from aunt peace silence fell rose said slowly with a pretty colour in her cheeks and a beseeching look about the room as if asking pardon of the boys  its very hard to choose when everybody is so fond of me therefore i think id better go to the one who seems to need me most  no dear the one you love the best and will be happiest with said dr alec quickly as a doleful sniff from aunt myra and a murmur of my sainted caroline made rose pause and look that way  take time cousin dont be in a hurry to make up your mind and remember codlins your friend added charlie hopeful still  i dont want any time i know who i love best who im happiest with and i choose uncle will he have me cried rose in a tone that produced a sympathetic thrill among the hearers it was so full of tender confidence and love  if she really had any doubt the look in dr alecs face banished it without a word as he opened wide his arms and she ran into them feeling that home was there  no one spoke for a minute but there were signs of emotion among the aunts which warned the boys to bestir themselves before the waterworks began to play so they took hands and began to prance about uncle and niece singing with sudden inspiration the nursery rhyme      ring around a rosy  of course that put an end to all sentiment and rose emerged laughing from dr alecs bosom with the mark of a waistcoat button nicely imprinted on her left cheek he saw it and said with a merry kiss that half effaced it this is my ewe lamb and i have set my mark on her so no one can steal her away  that tickled the boys and they set up a shout of      uncle had a little lamb  but rose hushed the noise by slipping into the circle and making them dance prettily like lads and lasses round a maypole while phebe coming in with fresh water for the flowers began to twitter chirp and coo as if all the birds of the air had come to join in the spring revel of the eight cousins,eight cousins,louisa may alcott 
part 1     chapter one playing pilgrims   christmas wont be christmas without any presents grumbled jo lying on the rug  its so dreadful to be poor sighed meg looking down at her old dress  i dont think its fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things and other girls nothing at all added little amy with an injured sniff  weve got father and mother and each other said beth contentedly from her corner  the four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words but darkened again as jo said sadly we havent got father and shall not have him for a long time she didnt say perhaps never but each silently added it thinking of father far away where the fighting was  nobody spoke for a minute then meg said in an altered tone you know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure when our men are suffering so in the army we cant do much but we can make our little sacrifices and ought to do it gladly but i am afraid i dont and meg shook her head as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted  but i dont think the little we should spend would do any good weve each got a dollar and the army wouldnt be much helped by our giving that i agree not to expect anything from mother or you but i do want to buy undine and sintran for myself ive wanted it so long said jo who was a bookworm  i planned to spend mine in new music said beth with a little sigh which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettleholder  i shall get a nice box of fabers drawing pencils i really need them said amy decidedly  mother didnt say anything about our money and she wont wish us to give up everything lets each buy what we want and have a little fun im sure we work hard enough to earn it cried jo examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner  i know i doteaching those tiresome children nearly all day when im longing to enjoy myself at home began meg in the complaining tone again  you dont have half such a hard time as i do said jo how would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous fussy old lady who keeps you trotting is never satisfied and worries you till youre ready to fly out the window or cry  its naughty to fret but i do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world it makes me cross and my hands get so stiff i cant practice well at all and beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time  i dont believe any of you suffer as i do cried amy for you dont have to go to school with impertinent girls who plague you if you dont know your lessons and laugh at your dresses and label your father if he isnt rich and insult you when your nose isnt nice  if you mean libel id say so and not talk about labels as if papa was a pickle bottle advised jo laughing  i know what i mean and you neednt be statirical about it its proper to use good words and improve your vocabilary returned amy with dignity  dont peck at one another children dont you wish we had the money papa lost when we were little jo dear me how happy and good wed be if we had no worries said meg who could remember better times  you said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the king children for they were fighting and fretting all the time in spite of their money  so i did beth well i think we are for though we do have to work we make fun of ourselves and are a pretty jolly set as jo would say  jo does use such slang words observed amy with a reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug  jo immediately sat up put her hands in her pockets and began to whistle  dont jo its so boyish  thats why i do it  i detest rude unladylike girls  i hate affected niminypiminy chits  birds in their little nests agree sang beth the peacemaker with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh and the pecking ended for that time  really girls you are both to be blamed said meg beginning to lecture in her eldersisterly fashion you are old enough to leave off boyish tricks and to behave better josephine it didnt matter so much when you were a little girl but now you are so tall and turn up your hair you should remember that you are a young lady  im not and if turning up my hair makes me one ill wear it in two tails till im twenty cried jo pulling off her net and shaking down a chestnut mane i hate to think ive got to grow up and be miss march and wear long gowns and look as prim as a china aster its bad enough to be a girl anyway when i like boys games and work and manners i cant get over my disappointment in not being a boy and its worse than ever now for im dying to go and fight with papa and i can only stay home and knit like a poky old woman  and jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets and her ball bounded across the room  poor jo its too bad but it cant be helped so you must try to be contented with making your name boyish and playing brother to us girls said beth stroking the rough head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its touch  as for you amy continued meg you are altogether too particular and prim your airs are funny now but youll grow up an affected little goose if you dont take care i like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking when you dont try to be elegant but your absurd words are as bad as jos slang  if jo is a tomboy and amy a goose what am i please asked beth ready to share the lecture  youre a dear and nothing else answered meg warmly and no one contradicted her for the mouse was the pet of the family  as young readers like to know how people look we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters who sat knitting away in the twilight while the december snow fell quietly without and the fire crackled cheerfully within it was a comfortable room though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain for a good picture or two hung on the walls books filled the recesses chrysanthemums and christmas roses bloomed in the windows and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it  margaret the eldest of the four was sixteen and very pretty being plump and fair with large eyes plenty of soft brown hair a sweet mouth and white hands of which she was rather vain fifteenyearold jo was very tall thin and brown and reminded one of a colt for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs which were very much in her way she had a decided mouth a comical nose and sharp gray eyes which appeared to see everything and were by turns fierce funny or thoughtful her long thick hair was her one beauty but it was usually bundled into a net to be out of her way round shoulders had jo big hands and feet a flyaway look to her clothes and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and didnt like it elizabeth or beth as everyone called her was a rosy smoothhaired brighteyed girl of thirteen with a shy manner a timid voice and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed her father called her little miss tranquility and the name suited her excellently for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved amy though the youngest was a most important person in her own opinion at least a regular snow maiden with blue eyes and yellow hair curling on her shoulders pale and slender and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners what the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out  the clock struck six and having swept up the hearth beth put a pair of slippers down to warm somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls for mother was coming and everyone brightened to welcome her meg stopped lecturing and lighted the lamp amy got out of the easy chair without being asked and jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze  they are quite worn out marmee must have a new pair  i thought id get her some with my dollar said beth  no i shall cried amy  im the oldest began meg but jo cut in with a decided im the man of the family now papa is away and i shall provide the slippers for he told me to take special care of mother while he was gone  ill tell you what well do said beth lets each get her something for christmas and not get anything for ourselves  thats like you dear what will we get exclaimed jo  everyone thought soberly for a minute then meg announced as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands i shall give her a nice pair of gloves  army shoes best to be had cried jo  some handkerchiefs all hemmed said beth  ill get a little bottle of cologne she likes it and it wont cost much so ill have some left to buy my pencils added amy  how will we give the things asked meg  put them on the table and bring her in and see her open the bundles dont you remember how we used to do on our birthdays answered jo  i used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair with the crown on and see you all come marching round to give the presents with a kiss i liked the things and the kisses but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while i opened the bundles said beth who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same time  let marmee think we are getting things for ourselves and then surprise her we must go shopping tomorrow afternoon meg there is so much to do about the play for christmas night said jo marching up and down with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air  i dont mean to act any more after this time im getting too old for such things observed meg who was as much a child as ever about dressingup frolics  you wont stop i know as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down and wear goldpaper jewelry you are the best actress weve got and therell be an end of everything if you quit the boards said jo we ought to rehearse tonight come here amy and do the fainting scene for you are as stiff as a poker in that  i cant help it i never saw anyone faint and i dont choose to make myself all black and blue tumbling flat as you do if i can go down easily ill drop if i cant i shall fall into a chair and be graceful i dont care if hugo does come at me with a pistol returned amy who was not gifted with dramatic power but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece  do it this way clasp your hands so and stagger across the room crying frantically roderigo save me save me and away went jo with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling  amy followed but she poked her hands out stiffly before her and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery and her ow was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish jo gave a despairing groan and meg laughed outright while beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest its no use do the best you can when the time comes and if the audience laughs dont blame me come on meg  then things went smoothly for don pedro defied the world in a speech of two pages without a single break hagar the witch chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads with weird effect roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully and hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic with a wild ha ha  its the best weve had yet said meg as the dead villain sat up and rubbed his elbows  i dont see how you can write and act such splendid things jo youre a regular shakespeare exclaimed beth who firmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things  not quite replied jo modestly i do think the witches curse an operatic tragedy is rather a nice thing but id like to try macbeth if we only had a trapdoor for banquo i always wanted to do the killing part is that a dagger that i see before me muttered jo rolling her eyes and clutching at the air as she had seen a famous tragedian do  no its the toasting fork with mothers shoe on it instead of the bread beths stagestruck cried meg and the rehearsal ended in a general burst of laughter  glad to find you so merry my girls said a cheery voice at the door and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall motherly lady with a can i help you look about her which was truly delightful she was not elegantly dressed but a noblelooking woman and the girls thought the gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the world  well dearies how have you got on today there was so much to do getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow that i didnt come home to dinner has anyone called beth how is your cold meg jo you look tired to death come and kiss me baby  while making these maternal inquiries mrs march got her wet things off her warm slippers on and sitting down in the easy chair drew amy to her lap preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day the girls flew about trying to make things comfortable each in her own way meg arranged the tea table jo brought wood and set chairs dropping overturning and clattering everything she touched beth trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen quiet and busy while amy gave directions to everyone as she sat with her hands folded  as they gathered about the table mrs march said with a particularly happy face ive got a treat for you after supper  a quick bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine beth clapped her hands regardless of the biscuit she held and jo tossed up her napkin crying a letter a letter three cheers for father  yes a nice long letter he is well and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared he sends all sorts of loving wishes for christmas and an especial message to you girls said mrs march patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there  hurry and get done dont stop to quirk your little finger and simper over your plate amy cried jo choking on her tea and dropping her bread butter side down on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat  beth ate no more but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood over the delight to come till the others were ready  i think it was so splendid in father to go as chaplain when he was too old to be drafted and not strong enough for a soldier said meg warmly  dont i wish i could go as a drummer a vivanwhats its name or a nurse so i could be near him and help him exclaimed jo with a groan  it must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent and eat all sorts of badtasting things and drink out of a tin mug sighed amy  when will he come home marmee asked beth with a little quiver in her voice  not for many months dear unless he is sick he will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can and we wont ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared now come and hear the letter  they all drew to the fire mother in the big chair with beth at her feet meg and amy perched on either arm of the chair and jo leaning on the back where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching especially those which fathers sent home in this one little was said of the hardships endured the dangers faced or the homesickness conquered it was a cheerful hopeful letter full of lively descriptions of camp life marches and military news and only at the end did the writers heart overflow with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home  give them all of my dear love and a kiss tell them i think of them by day pray for them by night and find my best comfort in their affection at all times a year seems very long to wait before i see them but remind them that while we wait we may all work so that these hard days need not be wasted i know they will remember all i said to them that they will be loving children to you will do their duty faithfully fight their bosom enemies bravely and conquer themselves so beautifully that when i come back to them i may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women everybody sniffed when they came to that part jo wasnt ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose and amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mothers shoulder and sobbed out i am a selfish girl but ill truly try to be better so he maynt be disappointed in me byandby  we all will cried meg i think too much of my looks and hate to work but wont any more if i can help it  ill try and be what he loves to call me a little woman and not be rough and wild but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else said jo thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down south  beth said nothing but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and began to knit with all her might losing no time in doing the duty that lay nearest her while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all that father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy coming home  mrs march broke the silence that followed jos words by saying in her cheery voice do you remember how you used to play pilgrims progress when you were little things nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper and let you travel through the house from the cellar which was the city of destruction up up to the housetop where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a celestial city  what fun it was especially going by the lions fighting apollyon and passing through the valley where the hobgoblins were said jo  i liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs said meg  i dont remember much about it except that i was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top if i wasnt too old for such things id rather like to play it over again said amy who began to talk of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve  we never are too old for this my dear because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or another our burdens are here our road is before us and the longing for goodness and happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace which is a true celestial city now my little pilgrims suppose you begin again not in play but in earnest and see how far on you can get before father comes home  really mother where are our bundles asked amy who was a very literal young lady  each of you told what your burden was just now except beth i rather think she hasnt got any said her mother  yes i have mine is dishes and dusters and envying girls with nice pianos and being afraid of people  beths bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh but nobody did for it would have hurt her feelings very much  let us do it said meg thoughtfully it is only another name for trying to be good and the story may help us for though we do want to be good its hard work and we forget and dont do our best  we were in the slough of despond tonight and mother came and pulled us out as help did in the book we ought to have our roll of directions like christian what shall we do about that asked jo delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her duty  look under your pillows christmas morning and you will find your guidebook replied mrs march  they talked over the new plan while old hannah cleared the table then out came the four little work baskets and the needles flew as the girls made sheets for aunt march it was uninteresting sewing but tonight no one grumbled they adopted jos plan of dividing the long seams into four parts and calling the quarters europe asia africa and america and in that way got on capitally especially when they talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through them  at nine they stopped work and sang as usual before they went to bed no one but beth could get much music out of the old piano but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang meg had a voice like a flute and she and her mother led the little choir amy chirped like a cricket and jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will always coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the most pensive tune they had always done this from the time they could lisp  crinkle crinkle ittle tar   and it had become a household custom for the mother was a born singer the first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the house singing like a lark and the last sound at night was the same cheery sound for the girls never grew too old for that familiar lullaby     chapter two a merry christmas   jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of christmas morning no stockings hung at the fireplace and for a moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago when her little sock fell down because it was crammed so full of goodies then she remembered her mothers promise and slipping her hand under her pillow drew out a little crimsoncovered book she knew it very well for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived and jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey she woke meg with a merry christmas and bade her see what was under her pillow a greencovered book appeared with the same picture inside and a few words written by their mother which made their one present very precious in their eyes presently beth and amy woke to rummage and find their little books also one dovecolored the other blue and all sat looking at and talking about them while the east grew rosy with the coming day  in spite of her small vanities margaret had a sweet and pious nature which unconsciously influenced her sisters especially jo who loved her very tenderly and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given  girls said meg seriously looking from the tumbled head beside her to the two little nightcapped ones in the room beyond mother wants us to read and love and mind these books and we must begin at once we used to be faithful about it but since father went away and all this war trouble unsettled us we have neglected many things you can do as you please but i shall keep my book on the table here and read a little every morning as soon as i wake for i know it will do me good and help me through the day  then she opened her new book and began to read jo put her arm round her and leaning cheek to cheek read also with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face  how good meg is come amy lets do as they do ill help you with the hard words and theyll explain things if we dont understand whispered beth very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters example  im glad mine is blue said amy and then the rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned and the winter sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a christmas greeting  where is mother asked meg as she and jo ran down to thank her for their gifts half an hour later  goodness only knows some poor creeter came abeggin and your ma went straight off to see what was needed there never was such a woman for givin away vittles and drink clothes and firin replied hannah who had lived with the family since meg was born and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant  she will be back soon i think so fry your cakes and have everything ready said meg looking over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa ready to be produced at the proper time why where is amys bottle of cologne she added as the little flask did not appear  she took it out a minute ago and went off with it to put a ribbon on it or some such notion replied jo dancing about the room to take the first stiffness off the new army slippers  how nice my handkerchiefs look dont they hannah washed and ironed them for me and i marked them all myself said beth looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor  bless the child shes gone and put mother on them instead of m march how funny cried jo taking one up  isnt that right i thought it was better to do it so because megs initials are mm and i dont want anyone to use these but marmee said beth looking troubled  its all right dear and a very pretty idea quite sensible too for no one can ever mistake now it will please her very much i know said meg with a frown for jo and a smile for beth  theres mother hide the basket quick cried jo as a door slammed and steps sounded in the hall  amy came in hastily and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters all waiting for her  where have you been and what are you hiding behind you asked meg surprised to see by her hood and cloak that lazy amy had been out so early  dont laugh at me jo i didnt mean anyone should know till the time came i only meant to change the little bottle for a big one and i gave all my money to get it and im truly trying not to be selfish any more  as she spoke amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap one and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget herself that meg hugged her on the spot and jo pronounced her a trump while beth ran to the window and picked her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle  you see i felt ashamed of my present after reading and talking about being good this morning so i ran round the corner and changed it the minute i was up and im so glad for mine is the handsomest now  another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa and the girls to the table eager for breakfast  merry christmas marmee many of them thank you for our books we read some and mean to every day they all cried in chorus  merry christmas little daughters im glad you began at once and hope you will keep on but i want to say one word before we sit down not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing for they have no fire there is nothing to eat over there and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold my girls will you give them your breakfast as a christmas present  they were all unusually hungry having waited nearly an hour and for a minute no one spoke only a minute for jo exclaimed impetuously im so glad you came before we began  may i go and help carry the things to the poor little children asked beth eagerly  i shall take the cream and the muffings added amy heroically giving up the article she most liked  meg was already covering the buckwheats and piling the bread into one big plate  i thought youd do it said mrs march smiling as if satisfied you shall all go and help me and when we come back we will have bread and milk for breakfast and make it up at dinnertime  they were soon ready and the procession set out fortunately it was early and they went through back streets so few people saw them and no one laughed at the queer party  a poor bare miserable room it was with broken windows no fire ragged bedclothes a sick mother wailing baby and a group of pale hungry children cuddled under one old quilt trying to keep warm  how the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in  ach mein gott it is good angels come to us said the poor woman crying for joy  funny angels in hoods and mittens said jo and set them to laughing  in a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there hannah who had carried wood made a fire and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak mrs march gave the mother tea and gruel and comforted her with promises of help while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own the girls meantime spread the table set the children round the fire and fed them like so many hungry birds laughing talking and trying to understand the funny broken english  das ist gut die engelkinder cried the poor things as they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze the girls had never been called angel children before and thought it very agreeable especially jo who had been considered a sancho ever since she was born that was a very happy breakfast though they didnt get any of it and when they went away leaving comfort behind i think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on christmas morning  thats loving our neighbor better than ourselves and i like it said meg as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor hummels  not a very splendid show but there was a great deal of love done up in the few little bundles and the tall vase of red roses white chrysanthemums and trailing vines which stood in the middle gave quite an elegant air to the table  shes coming strike up beth open the door amy three cheers for marmee cried jo prancing about while meg went to conduct mother to the seat of honor  beth played her gayest march amy threw open the door and meg enacted escort with great dignity mrs march was both surprised and touched and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the little notes which accompanied them the slippers went on at once a new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket well scented with amys cologne the rose was fastened in her bosom and the nice gloves were pronounced a perfect fit  there was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining in the simple loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at the time so sweet to remember long afterward and then all fell to work  the morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities being still too young to go often to the theater and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private performances the girls put their wits to work and necessity being the mother of invention made whatever they needed very clever were some of their productions pasteboard guitars antique lamps made of oldfashioned butter boats covered with silver paper gorgeous robes of old cotton glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory and armor covered with the same useful diamond shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of preserve pots were cut out the big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels  no gentleman were admitted so jo played male parts to her hearts content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots given her by a friend who knew a lady who knew an actor these boots an old foil and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some picture were jos chief treasures and appeared on all occasions the smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors to take several parts apiece and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts whisking in and out of various costumes and managing the stage besides it was excellent drill for their memories a harmless amusement and employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle lonely or spent in less profitable society  on christmas night a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the dress circle and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy there was a good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain a trifle of lamp smoke and an occasional giggle from amy who was apt to get hysterical in the excitement of the moment presently a bell sounded the curtains flew apart and the operatic tragedy began  a gloomy wood according to the one playbill was represented by a few shrubs in pots green baize on the floor and a cave in the distance this cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof bureaus for walls and in it was a small furnace in full blast with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over it the stage was dark and the glow of the furnace had a fine effect especially as real steam issued from the kettle when the witch took off the cover a moment was allowed for the first thrill to subside then hugo the villain stalked in with a clanking sword at his side a slouching hat black beard mysterious cloak and the boots after pacing to and fro in much agitation he struck his forehead and burst out in a wild strain singing of his hatred for roderigo his love for zara and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other the gruff tones of hugos voice with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him were very impressive and the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise he stole to the cavern and ordered hagar to come forth with a commanding what ho minion i need thee  out came meg with gray horsehair hanging about her face a red and black robe a staff and cabalistic signs upon her cloak hugo demanded a potion to make zara adore him and one to destroy roderigo hagar in a fine dramatic melody promised both and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the love philter  hither hither from thy home airy sprite i bid thee come born of roses fed on dew charms and potions canst thou brew bring me here with elfin speed the fragrant philter which i need make it sweet and swift and strong spirit answer now my song   a soft strain of music sounded and then at the back of the cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white with glittering wings golden hair and a garland of roses on its head waving a wand it sang  hither i come from my airy home afar in the silver moon take the magic spell and use it well or its power will vanish soon   and dropping a small gilded bottle at the witchs feet the spirit vanished another chant from hagar produced another apparition not a lovely one for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and having croaked a reply tossed a dark bottle at hugo and disappeared with a mocking laugh having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his boots hugo departed and hagar informed the audience that as he had killed a few of her friends in times past she had cursed him and intends to thwart his plans and be revenged on him then the curtain fell and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits of the play  a good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again but when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been got up no one murmured at the delay it was truly superb a tower rose to the ceiling halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning in it and behind the white curtain appeared zara in a lovely blue and silver dress waiting for roderigo he came in gorgeous array with plumed cap red cloak chestnut lovelocks a guitar and the boots of course kneeling at the foot of the tower he sang a serenade in melting tones zara replied and after a musical dialogue consented to fly then came the grand effect of the play roderigo produced a rope ladder with five steps to it threw up one end and invited zara to descend timidly she crept from her lattice put her hand on roderigos shoulder and was about to leap gracefully down when alas alas for zara she forgot her train it caught in the window the tower tottered leaned forward fell with a crash and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins  a universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the wreck and a golden head emerged exclaiming i told you so i told you so with wonderful presence of mind don pedro the cruel sire rushed in dragged out his daughter with a hasty aside  dont laugh act as if it was all right and ordering roderigo up banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn though decidedly shaken by the fall from the tower upon him roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir this dauntless example fired zara she also defied her sire and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle a stout little retainer came in with chains and led them away looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made  act third was the castle hall and here hagar appeared having come to free the lovers and finish hugo she hears him coming and hides sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little servant bear them to the captives in their cells and tell them i shall come anon the servant takes hugo aside to tell him something and hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless ferdinando the minion carries them away and hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for roderigo hugo getting thirsty after a long warble drinks it loses his wits and after a good deal of clutching and stamping falls flat and dies while hagar informs him what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody  this was a truly thrilling scene though some persons might have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair rather marred the effect of the villains death he was called before the curtain and with great propriety appeared leading hagar whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put together  act fourth displayed the despairing roderigo on the point of stabbing himself because he has been told that zara has deserted him just as the dagger is at his heart a lovely song is sung under his window informing him that zara is true but in danger and he can save her if he will a key is thrown in which unlocks the door and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his lady love  act fifth opened with a stormy scene between zara and don pedro he wishes her to go into a convent but she wont hear of it and after a touching appeal is about to faint when roderigo dashes in and demands her hand don pedro refuses because he is not rich they shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree and rodrigo is about to bear away the exhausted zara when the timid servant enters with a letter and a bag from hagar who has mysteriously disappeared the latter informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to don pedro if he doesnt make them happy the bag is opened and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage till it is quite glorified with the glitter this entirely softens the stern sire he consents without a murmur all join in a joyful chorus and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive don pedros blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace  tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check for the cot bed on which the dress circle was built suddenly shut up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience roderigo and don pedro flew to the rescue and all were taken out unhurt though many were speechless with laughter the excitement had hardly subsided when hannah appeared with mrs marchs compliments and would the ladies walk down to supper  this was a surprise even to the actors and when they saw the table they looked at one another in rapturous amazement it was like marmee to get up a little treat for them but anything so fine as this was unheard of since the departed days of plenty there was ice cream actually two dishes of it pink and white and cake and fruit and distracting french bonbons and in the middle of the table four great bouquets of hot house flowers  it quite took their breath away and they stared first at the table and then at their mother who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely  is it fairies asked amy  santa claus said beth  mother did it and meg smiled her sweetest in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows  aunt march had a good fit and sent the supper cried jo with a sudden inspiration  all wrong old mr laurence sent it replied mrs march  the laurence boys grandfather what in the world put such a thing into his head we dont know him exclaimed meg  hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party he is an odd old gentleman but that pleased him he knew my father years ago and he sent me a polite note this afternoon saying he hoped i would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day i could not refuse and so you have a little feast at night to make up for the breadandmilk breakfast  that boy put it into his head i know he did hes a capital fellow and i wish we could get acquainted he looks as if hed like to know us but hes bashful and meg is so prim she wont let me speak to him when we pass said jo as the plates went round and the ice began to melt out of sight with ohs and ahs of satisfaction  you mean the people who live in the big house next door dont you asked one of the girls my mother knows old mr laurence but says hes very proud and doesnt like to mix with his neighbors he keeps his grandson shut up when he isnt riding or walking with his tutor and makes him study very hard we invited him to our party but he didnt come mother says hes very nice though he never speaks to us girls  our cat ran away once and he brought her back and we talked over the fence and were getting on capitally all about cricket and so on when he saw meg coming and walked off i mean to know him some day for he needs fun im sure he does said jo decidedly  i like his manners and he looks like a little gentleman so ive no objection to your knowing him if a proper opportunity comes he brought the flowers himself and i should have asked him in if i had been sure what was going on upstairs he looked so wistful as he went away hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own  its a mercy you didnt mother laughed jo looking at her boots but well have another play sometime that he can see perhaps hell help act wouldnt that be jolly  i never had such a fine bouquet before how pretty it is and meg examined her flowers with great interest  they are lovely but beths roses are sweeter to me said mrs march smelling the halfdead posy in her belt  beth nestled up to her and whispered softly i wish i could send my bunch to father im afraid he isnt having such a merry christmas as we are     chapter three the laurence boy   jo jo where are you cried meg at the foot of the garret stairs  here answered a husky voice from above and running up meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the heir of redclyffe wrapped up in a comforter on an old threelegged sofa by the sunny window this was jos favorite refuge and here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and didnt mind her a particle as meg appeared scrabble whisked into his hole jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news  such fun only see a regular note of invitation from mrs gardiner for tomorrow night cried meg waving the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight  mrs gardiner would be happy to see miss march and miss josephine at a little dance on new years eve marmee is willing we should go now what shall we wear  whats the use of asking that when you know we shall wear our poplins because we havent got anything else answered jo with her mouth full  if i only had a silk sighed meg mother says i may when im eighteen perhaps but two years is an everlasting time to wait  im sure our pops look like silk and they are nice enough for us yours is as good as new but i forgot the burn and the tear in mine whatever shall i do the burn shows badly and i cant take any out  you must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight the front is all right i shall have a new ribbon for my hair and marmee will lend me her little pearl pin and my new slippers are lovely and my gloves will do though they arent as nice as id like  mine are spoiled with lemonade and i cant get any new ones so i shall have to go without said jo who never troubled herself much about dress  you must have gloves or i wont go cried meg decidedly gloves are more important than anything else you cant dance without them and if you dont i should be so mortified  then ill stay still i dont care much for company dancing its no fun to go sailing round i like to fly about and cut capers  you cant ask mother for new ones they are so expensive and you are so careless she said when you spoiled the others that she shouldnt get you any more this winter cant you make them do  i can hold them crumpled up in my hand so no one will know how stained they are thats all i can do no ill tell you how we can manage each wear one good one and carry a bad one dont you see  your hands are bigger than mine and you will stretch my glove dreadfully began meg whose gloves were a tender point with her  then ill go without i dont care what people say cried jo taking up her book  you may have it you may only dont stain it and do behave nicely dont put your hands behind you or stare or say christopher columbus will you  dont worry about me ill be as prim as i can and not get into any scrapes if i can help it now go and answer your note and let me finish this splendid story  so meg went away to accept with thanks look over her dress and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill while jo finished her story her four apples and had a game of romps with scrabble  on new years eve the parlor was deserted for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the allimportant business of getting ready for the party simple as the toilets were there was a great deal of running up and down laughing and talking and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house meg wanted a few curls about her face and jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs  ought they to smoke like that asked beth from her perch on the bed  its the dampness drying replied jo  what a queer smell its like burned feathers observed amy smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air  there now ill take off the papers and youll see a cloud of little ringlets said jo putting down the tongs  she did take off the papers but no cloud of ringlets appeared for the hair came with the papers and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim  oh oh oh what have you done im spoiled i cant go my hair oh my hair wailed meg looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead  just my luck you shouldnt have asked me to do it i always spoil everything im so sorry but the tongs were too hot and so ive made a mess groaned poor jo regarding the little black pancakes with tears of regret  it isnt spoiled just frizzle it and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit and it will look like the last fashion ive seen many girls do it so said amy consolingly  serves me right for trying to be fine i wish id let my hair alone cried meg petulantly  so do i it was so smooth and pretty but it will soon grow out again said beth coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep  after various lesser mishaps meg was finished at last and by the united exertions of the entire family jos hair was got up and her dress on they looked very well in their simple suits megs in silvery drab with a blue velvet snood lace frills and the pearl pin jo in maroon with a stiff gentlemanly linen collar and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament each put on one nice light glove and carried one soiled one and all pronounced the effect quite easy and fine megs highheeled slippers were very tight and hurt her though she would not own it and jos nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head which was not exactly comfortable but dear me let us be elegant or die  have a good time dearies said mrs march as the sisters went daintily down the walk dont eat much supper and come away at eleven when i send hannah for you as the gate clashed behind them a voice cried from a window  girls girls have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs  yes yes spandy nice and meg has cologne on hers cried jo adding with a laugh as they went on i do believe marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake  it is one of her aristocratic tastes and quite proper for a real lady is always known by neat boots gloves and handkerchief replied meg who had a good many little aristocratic tastes of her own  now dont forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight jo is my sash right and does my hair look very bad said meg as she turned from the glass in mrs gardiners dressing room after a prolonged prink  i know i shall forget if you see me doing anything wrong just remind me by a wink will you returned jo giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush  no winking isnt ladylike ill lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong and nod if you are all right now hold your shoulder straight and take short steps and dont shake hands if you are introduced to anyone it isnt the thing  how do you learn all the proper ways i never can isnt that music gay  down they went feeling a trifle timid for they seldom went to parties and informal as this little gathering was it was an event to them mrs gardiner a stately old lady greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters meg knew sallie and was at her ease very soon but jo who didnt care much for girls or girlish gossip stood about with her back carefully against the wall and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room and she longed to go and join them for skating was one of the joys of her life she telegraphed her wish to meg but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir no one came to talk to her and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone she could not roam about and amuse herself for the burned breadth would show so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began meg was asked at once and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner and fearing he meant to engage her she slipped into a curtained recess intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace unfortunately another bashful person had chosen the same refuge for as the curtain fell behind her she found herself face to face with the laurence boy  dear me i didnt know anyone was here stammered jo preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in  but the boy laughed and said pleasantly though he looked a little startled dont mind me stay if you like  shant i disturb you  not a bit i only came here because i dont know many people and felt rather strange at first you know  so did i dont go away please unless youd rather  the boy sat down again and looked at his pumps till jo said trying to be polite and easy i think ive had the pleasure of seeing you before you live near us dont you  next door and he looked up and laughed outright for jos prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home  that put jo at her ease and she laughed too as she said in her heartiest way we did have such a good time over your nice christmas present  grandpa sent it  but you put it into his head didnt you now  how is your cat miss march asked the boy trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun  nicely thank you mr laurence but i am not miss march im only jo returned the young lady  im not mr laurence im only laurie  laurie laurence what an odd name  my first name is theodore but i dont like it for the fellows called me dora so i made them say laurie instead  i hate my name too so sentimental i wish every one would say jo instead of josephine how did you make the boys stop calling you dora  i thrashed em  i cant thrash aunt march so i suppose i shall have to bear it and jo resigned herself with a sigh  dont you like to dance miss jo asked laurie looking as if he thought the name suited her  i like it well enough if there is plenty of room and everyone is lively in a place like this im sure to upset something tread on peoples toes or do something dreadful so i keep out of mischief and let meg sail about dont you dance  sometimes you see ive been abroad a good many years and havent been into company enough yet to know how you do things here  abroad cried jo oh tell me about it i love dearly to hear people describe their travels  laurie didnt seem to know where to begin but jos eager questions soon set him going and he told her how he had been at school in vevay where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake and for holiday fun went on walking trips about switzerland with their teachers  dont i wish id been there cried jo did you go to paris  we spent last winter there  can you talk french  we were not allowed to speak anything else at vevay  do say some i can read it but cant pronounce  quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis  how nicely you do it let me see  you said who is the young lady in the pretty slippers didnt you  oui mademoiselle  its my sister margaret and you knew it was do you think she is pretty  yes she makes me think of the german girls she looks so fresh and quiet and dances like a lady  jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister and stored it up to repeat to meg both peeped and criticized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances lauries bashfulness soon wore off for jos gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease and jo was her merry self again because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her she liked the laurence boy better than ever and took several good looks at him so that she might describe him to the girls for they had no brothers very few male cousins and boys were almost unknown creatures to them  curly black hair brown skin big black eyes handsome nose fine teeth small hands and feet taller than i am very polite for a boy and altogether jolly wonder how old he is  it was on the tip of jos tongue to ask but she checked herself in time and with unusual tact tried to find out in a roundabout way  i suppose you are going to college soon i see you pegging away at your books no i mean studying hard and jo blushed at the dreadful pegging which had escaped her  laurie smiled but didnt seem shocked and answered with a shrug not for a year or two i wont go before seventeen anyway  arent you but fifteen asked jo looking at the tall lad whom she had imagined seventeen already  sixteen next month  how i wish i was going to college you dont look as if you liked it  i hate it nothing but grinding or skylarking and i dont like the way fellows do either in this country  what do you like  to live in italy and to enjoy myself in my own way  jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them so she changed the subject by saying as her foot kept time thats a splendid polka why dont you go and try it  if you will come too he answered with a gallant little bow  i cant for i told meg i wouldnt because there jo stopped and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh  because what  you wont tell  never  well i have a bad trick of standing before the fire and so i burn my frocks and i scorched this one and though its nicely mended it shows and meg told me to keep still so no one would see it you may laugh if you want to it is funny i know  but laurie didnt laugh he only looked down a minute and the expression of his face puzzled jo when he said very gently never mind that ill tell you how we can manage theres a long hall out there and we can dance grandly and no one will see us please come  jo thanked him and gladly went wishing she had two neat gloves when she saw the nice pearlcolored ones her partner wore the hall was empty and they had a grand polka for laurie danced well and taught her the german step which delighted jo being full of swing and spring when the music stopped they sat down on the stairs to get their breath and laurie was in the midst of an account of a students festival at heidelberg when meg appeared in search of her sister she beckoned and jo reluctantly followed her into a side room where she found her on a sofa holding her foot and looking pale  ive sprained my ankle that stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench it aches so i can hardly stand and i dont know how im ever going to get home she said rocking to and fro in pain  i knew youd hurt your feet with those silly shoes im sorry but i dont see what you can do except get a carriage or stay here all night answered jo softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke  i cant have a carriage without its costing ever so much i dare say i cant get one at all for most people come in their own and its a long way to the stable and no one to send  ill go  no indeed its past nine and dark as egypt i cant stop here for the house is full sallie has some girls staying with her ill rest till hannah comes and then do the best i can  ill ask laurie he will go said jo looking relieved as the idea occurred to her  mercy no dont ask or tell anyone get me my rubbers and put these slippers with our things i cant dance anymore but as soon as supper is over watch for hannah and tell me the minute she comes  they are going out to supper now ill stay with you id rather  no dear run along and bring me some coffee im so tired i cant stir  so meg reclined with rubbers well hidden and jo went blundering away to the dining room which she found after going into a china closet and opening the door of a room where old mr gardiner was taking a little private refreshment making a dart at the table she secured the coffee which she immediately spilled thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back  oh dear what a blunderbuss i am exclaimed jo finishing megs glove by scrubbing her gown with it  can i help you said a friendly voice and there was laurie with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other  i was trying to get something for meg who is very tired and someone shook me and here i am in a nice state answered jo glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the coffeecolored glove  too bad i was looking for someone to give this to may i take it to your sister  oh thank you ill show you where she is i dont offer to take it myself for i should only get into another scrape if i did  jo led the way and as if used to waiting on ladies laurie drew up a little table brought a second installment of coffee and ice for jo and was so obliging that even particular meg pronounced him a nice boy they had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes and were in the midst of a quiet game of buzz with two or three other young people who had strayed in when hannah appeared meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of jo with an exclamation of pain  hush dont say anything she whispered adding aloud its nothing i turned my foot a little thats all and limped upstairs to put her things on  hannah scolded meg cried and jo was at her wits end till she decided to take things into her own hands slipping out she ran down and finding a servant asked if he could get her a carriage it happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood and jo was looking round for help when laurie who had heard what she said came up and offered his grandfathers carriage which had just come for him he said  its so early you cant mean to go yet began jo looking relieved but hesitating to accept the offer  i always go early i do truly please let me take you home its all on my way you know and it rains they say  that settled it and telling him of megs mishap jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage feeling very festive and elegant laurie went on the box so meg could keep her foot up and the girls talked over their party in freedom  i had a capital time did you asked jo rumpling up her hair and making herself comfortable  yes till i hurt myself sallies friend annie moffat took a fancy to me and asked me to come and spend a week with her when sallie does she is going in the spring when the opera comes and it will be perfectly splendid if mother only lets me go answered meg cheering up at the thought  i saw you dancing with the red headed man i ran away from was he nice  oh very his hair is auburn not red and he was very polite and i had a delicious redowa with him  he looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step laurie and i couldnt help laughing did you hear us  no but it was very rude what were you about all that time hidden away there  jo told her adventures and by the time she had finished they were at home with many thanks they said good night and crept in hoping to disturb no one but the instant their door creaked two little nightcaps bobbed up and two sleepy but eager voices cried out  tell about the party tell about the party  with what meg called a great want of manners jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls and they soon subsided after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening  i declare it really seems like being a fine young lady to come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown with a maid to wait on me said meg as jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed her hair  i dont believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do in spite of our burned hair old gowns one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them and i think jo was quite right     chapter four burdens   oh dear how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on sighed meg the morning after the party for now the holidays were over the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the task she never liked  i wish it was christmas or new years all the time wouldnt it be fun answered jo yawning dismally  we shouldnt enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now but it does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets and go to parties and drive home and read and rest and not work its like other people you know and i always envy girls who do such things im so fond of luxury said meg trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby  well we cant have it so dont let us grumble but shoulder our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as marmee does im sure aunt march is a regular old man of the sea to me but i suppose when ive learned to carry her without complaining she will tumble off or get so light that i shant mind her  this idea tickled jos fancy and put her in good spirits but meg didnt brighten for her burden consisting of four spoiled children seemed heavier than ever she had not heart enough even to make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair in the most becoming way  wheres the use of looking nice when no one sees me but those cross midgets and no one cares whether im pretty or not she muttered shutting her drawer with a jerk i shall have to toil and moil all my days with only little bits of fun now and then and get old and ugly and sour because im poor and cant enjoy my life as other girls do its a shame  so meg went down wearing an injured look and wasnt at all agreeable at breakfast time everyone seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to croak  beth had a headache and lay on the sofa trying to comfort herself with the cat and three kittens amy was fretting because her lessons were not learned and she couldnt find her rubbers jo would whistle and make a great racket getting ready  mrs march was very busy trying to finish a letter which must go at once and hannah had the grumps for being up late didnt suit her  there never was such a cross family cried jo losing her temper when she had upset an inkstand broken both boot lacings and sat down upon her hat  youre the crossest person in it returned amy washing out the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her slate  beth if you dont keep these horrid cats down cellar ill have them drowned exclaimed meg angrily as she tried to get rid of the kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach  jo laughed meg scolded beth implored and amy wailed because she couldnt remember how much nine times twelve was  girls girls do be quiet one minute i must get this off by the early mail and you drive me distracted with your worry cried mrs march crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter  there was a momentary lull broken by hannah who stalked in laid two hot turnovers on the table and stalked out again these turnovers were an institution and the girls called them muffs for they had no others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold mornings  hannah never forgot to make them no matter how busy or grumpy she might be for the walk was long and bleak the poor things got no other lunch and were seldom home before two  cuddle your cats and get over your headache bethy goodbye marmee we are a set of rascals this morning but well come home regular angels now then meg and jo tramped away feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do  they always looked back before turning the corner for their mother was always at the window to nod and smile and wave her hand to them somehow it seemed as if they couldnt have got through the day without that for whatever their mood might be the last glimpse of that motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine  if marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us it would serve us right for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never seen cried jo taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and bitter wind  dont use such dreadful expressions replied meg from the depths of the veil in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world  i like good strong words that mean something replied jo catching her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to flying away altogether  call yourself any names you like but i am neither a rascal nor a wretch and i dont choose to be called so  youre a blighted being and decidedly cross today because you cant sit in the lap of luxury all the time poor dear just wait till i make my fortune and you shall revel in carriages and ice cream and highheeled slippers and posies and redheaded boys to dance with  how ridiculous you are jo but meg laughed at the nonsense and felt better in spite of herself  lucky for you i am for if i put on crushed airs and tried to be dismal as you do we should be in a nice state thank goodness i can always find something funny to keep me up dont croak any more but come home jolly theres a dear  jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for the day each going a different way each hugging her little warm turnover and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather hard work and the unsatisfied desires of pleasureloving youth  when mr march lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate friend the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward their own support at least believing that they could not begin too early to cultivate energy industry and independence their parents consented and both fell to work with the hearty good will which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last  margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with her small salary as she said she was fond of luxury and her chief trouble was poverty she found it harder to bear than the others because she could remember a time when home was beautiful life full of ease and pleasure and want of any kind unknown she tried not to be envious or discontented but it was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things gay friends accomplishments and a happy life at the kings she daily saw all she wanted for the childrens older sisters were just out and meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets heard lively gossip about theaters concerts sleighing parties and merrymakings of all kinds and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to her poor meg seldom complained but a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone sometimes for she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy  jo happened to suit aunt march who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her the childless old lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came and was much offended because her offer was declined other friends told the marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old ladys will but the unworldly marches only said  we cant give up our girls for a dozen fortunes rich or poor we will keep together and be happy in one another  the old lady wouldnt speak to them for a time but happening to meet jo at a friends something in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old ladys fancy and she proposed to take her for a companion this did not suit jo at all but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and to every ones surprise got on remarkably well with her irascible relative there was an occasional tempest and once jo marched home declaring she couldnt bear it longer but aunt march always cleared up quickly and sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she could not refuse for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady  i suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books which was left to dust and spiders since uncle march died jo remembered the kind old gentleman who used to let her build railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries tell her stories about queer pictures in his latin books and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street the dim dusty room with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases the cozy chairs the globes and best of all the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked made the library a region of bliss to her  the moment aunt march took her nap or was busy with company jo hurried to this quiet place and curling herself up in the easy chair devoured poetry romance history travels and pictures like a regular bookworm but like all happiness it did not last long for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story the sweetest verse of a song or the most perilous adventure of her traveler a shrill voice called josyphine josyphine and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn wash the poodle or read belshams essays by the hour together  jos ambition was to do something very splendid what it was she had no idea as yet but left it for time to tell her and meanwhile found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldnt read run and ride as much as she liked a quick temper sharp tongue and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes and her life was a series of ups and downs which were both comic and pathetic but the training she received at aunt marchs was just what she needed and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual josyphine  beth was too bashful to go to school it had been tried but she suffered so much that it was given up and she did her lessons at home with her father even when he went away and her mother was called to devote her skill and energy to soldiers aid societies beth went faithfully on by herself and did the best she could she was a housewifely little creature and helped hannah keep home neat and comfortable for the workers never thinking of any reward but to be loved long quiet days she spent not lonely nor idle for her little world was peopled with imaginary friends and she was by nature a busy bee there were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning for beth was a child still and loved her pets as well as ever not one whole or handsome one among them all were outcasts till beth took them in for when her sisters outgrew these idols they passed to her because amy would have nothing old or ugly beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very reason and set up a hospital for infirm dolls no pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals no harsh words or blows were ever given them no neglect ever saddened the heart of the most repulsive but all were fed and clothed nursed and caressed with an affection which never failed one forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to jo and having led a tempestuous life was left a wreck in the rag bag from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by beth and taken to her refuge having no top to its head she tied on a neat little cap and as both arms and legs were gone she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid if anyone had known the care lavished on that dolly i think it would have touched their hearts even while they laughed she brought it bits of bouquets she read to it took it out to breathe fresh air hidden under her coat she sang it lullabies and never went to bed without kissing its dirty face and whispering tenderly i hope youll have a good night my poor dear  beth had her troubles as well as the others and not being an angel but a very human little girl she often wept a little weep as jo said because she couldnt take music lessons and have a fine piano she loved music so dearly tried so hard to learn and practiced away so patiently at the jingling old instrument that it did seem as if someone not to hint aunt march ought to help her nobody did however and nobody saw beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys that wouldnt keep in tune when she was all alone she sang like a little lark about her work never was too tired for marmee and the girls and day after day said hopefully to herself i know ill get my music some time if im good  there are many beths in the world shy and quiet sitting in corners till needed and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping and the sweet sunshiny presence vanishes leaving silence and shadow behind  if anybody had asked amy what the greatest trial of her life was she would have answered at once my nose when she was a baby jo had accidently dropped her into the coal hod and amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever it was not big nor red like poor petreas it was only rather flat and all the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point no one minded it but herself and it was doing its best to grow but amy felt deeply the want of a grecian nose and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself  little raphael as her sisters called her had a decided talent for drawing and was never so happy as when copying flowers designing fairies or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she covered her slate with animals the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps on and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering out of all her books at unlucky moments she got through her lessons as well as she could and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment she was a great favorite with her mates being goodtempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort her little airs and graces were much admired so were her accomplishments for besides her drawing she could play twelve tunes crochet and read french without mispronouncing more than twothirds of the words she had a plaintive way of saying when papa was rich we did soandso which was very touching and her long words were considered perfectly elegant by the girls  amy was in a fair way to be spoiled for everyone petted her and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely one thing however rather quenched the vanities she had to wear her cousins clothes now florences mama hadnt a particle of taste and amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet unbecoming gowns and fussy aprons that did not fit everything was good well made and little worn but amys artistic eyes were much afflicted especially this winter when her school dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no trimming  my only comfort she said to meg with tears in her eyes is that mother doesnt take tucks in my dresses whenever im naughty as maria parkss mother does my dear its really dreadful for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees and she cant come to school when i think of this deggerredation i feel that i can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow skyrockets on it  meg was amys confidant and monitor and by some strange attraction of opposites jo was gentle beths to jo alone did the shy child tell her thoughts and over her big harumscarum sister beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone in the family the two older girls were a great deal to one another but each took one of the younger sisters into her keeping and watched over her in her own way playing mother they called it and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of little women  has anybody got anything to tell its been such a dismal day im really dying for some amusement said meg as they sat sewing together that evening  i had a queer time with aunt today and as i got the best of it ill tell you about it began jo who dearly loved to tell stories i was reading that everlasting belsham and droning away as i always do for aunt soon drops off and then i take out some nice book and read like fury till she wakes up i actually made myself sleepy and before she began to nod i gave such a gape that she asked me what i meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once  i wish i could and be done with it said i trying not to be saucy  then she gave me a long lecture on my sins and told me to sit and think them over while she just lost herself for a moment she never finds herself very soon so the minute her cap began to bob like a topheavy dahlia i whipped the vicar of wakefield out of my pocket and read away with one eye on him and one on aunt id just got to where they all tumbled into the water when i forgot and laughed out loud aunt woke up and being more goodnatured after her nap told me to read a bit and show what frivolous work i preferred to the worthy and instructive belsham i did my very best and she liked it though she only said  i dont understand what its all about go back and begin it child  back i went and made the primroses as interesting as ever i could once i was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place and say meekly im afraid it tires you maam shant i stop now  she caught up her knitting which had dropped out of her hands gave me a sharp look through her specs and said in her short way finish the chapter and dont be impertinent miss  did she own she liked it asked meg  oh bless you no but she let old belsham rest and when i ran back after my gloves this afternoon there she was so hard at the vicar that she didnt hear me laugh as i danced a jig in the hall because of the good time coming what a pleasant life she might have if only she chose i dont envy her much in spite of her money for after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones i think added jo  that reminds me said meg that ive got something to tell it isnt funny like jos story but i thought about it a good deal as i came home at the kings today i found everybody in a flurry and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful and papa had sent him away i heard mrs king crying and mr king talking very loud and grace and ellen turned away their faces when they passed me so i shouldnt see how red and swollen their eyes were i didnt ask any questions of course but i felt so sorry for them and was rather glad i hadnt any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family  i think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger than anything bad boys can do said amy shaking her head as if her experience of life had been a deep one susie perkins came to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring i wanted it dreadfully and wished i was her with all my might well she drew a picture of mr davis with a monstrous nose and a hump and the words young ladies my eye is upon you coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing we were laughing over it when all of a sudden his eye was on us and he ordered susie to bring up her slate she was parrylized with fright but she went and oh what do you think he did he took her by the earthe ear just fancy how horridand led her to the recitation platform and made her stand there half an hour holding the slate so everyone could see  didnt the girls laugh at the picture asked jo who relished the scrape  laugh not one they sat still as mice and susie cried quarts i know she did i didnt envy her then for i felt that millions of carnelian rings wouldnt have made me happy after that i never never should have got over such a agonizing mortification and amy went on with her work in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath  i saw something i liked this morning and i meant to tell it at dinner but i forgot said beth putting jos topsyturvy basket in order as she talked when i went to get some oysters for hannah mr laurence was in the fish shop but he didnt see me for i kept behind the fish barrel and he was busy with mr cutter the fishman a poor woman came in with a pail and a mop and asked mr cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish because she hadnt any dinner for her children and had been disappointed of a days work mr cutter was in a hurry and said no rather crossly so she was going away looking hungry and sorry when mr laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her she was so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms and thanked him over and over he told her to go along and cook it and she hurried off so happy wasnt it good of him oh she did look so funny hugging the big slippery fish and hoping mr laurences bed in heaven would be aisy  when they had laughed at beths story they asked their mother for one and after a moments thought she said soberly as i sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms i felt very anxious about father and thought how lonely and helpless we should be if anything happened to him it was not a wise thing to do but i kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some clothes he sat down near me and i began to talk to him for he looked poor and tired and anxious  have you sons in the army i asked for the note he brought was not to me  yes maam i had four but two were killed one is a prisoner and im going to the other who is very sick in a washington hospital he answered quietly  you have done a great deal for your country sir i said feeling respect now instead of pity  not a mite more than i ought maam id go myself if i was any use as i aint i give my boys and give em free  he spoke so cheerfully looked so sincere and seemed so glad to give his all that i was ashamed of myself id given one man and thought it too much while he gave four without grudging them i had all my girls to comfort me at home and his last son was waiting miles away to say goodby to him perhaps i felt so rich so happy thinking of my blessings that i made him a nice bundle gave him some money and thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me  tell another story mother one with a moral to it like this i like to think about them afterward if they are real and not too preachy said jo after a minutes silence  mrs march smiled and began at once for she had told stories to this little audience for many years and knew how to please them  once upon a time there were four girls who had enough to eat and drink and wear a good many comforts and pleasures kind friends and parents who loved them dearly and yet they were not contented here the listeners stole sly looks at one another and began to sew diligently these girls were anxious to be good and made many excellent resolutions but they did not keep them very well and were constantly saying if only we had this or if we could only do that quite forgetting how much they already had and how many things they actually could do so they asked an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy and she said when you feel discontented think over your blessings and be grateful here jo looked up quickly as if about to speak but changed her mind seeing that the story was not done yet  being sensible girls they decided to try her advice and soon were surprised to see how well off they were one discovered that money couldnt keep shame and sorrow out of rich peoples houses another that though she was poor she was a great deal happier with her youth health and good spirits than a certain fretful feeble old lady who couldnt enjoy her comforts a third that disagreeable as it was to help get dinner it was harder still to go begging for it and the fourth that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior so they agreed to stop complaining to enjoy the blessings already possessed and try to deserve them lest they should be taken away entirely instead of increased and i believe they were never disappointed or sorry that they took the old womans advice  now marmee that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories against us and give us a sermon instead of a romance cried meg  i like that kind of sermon its the sort father used to tell us said beth thoughtfully putting the needles straight on jos cushion  i dont complain near as much as the others do and i shall be more careful than ever now for ive had warning from susies downfall said amy morally  we needed that lesson and we wont forget it if we do so you just say to us as old chloe did in uncle tom tink ob yer marcies chillen tink ob yer marcies added jo who could not for the life of her help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon though she took it to heart as much as any of them     chapter five being neighborly   what in the world are you going to do now jo asked meg one snowy afternoon as her sister came tramping through the hall in rubber boots old sack and hood with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other  going out for exercise answered jo with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes  i should think two long walks this morning would have been enough its cold and dull out and i advise you to stay warm and dry by the fire as i do said meg with a shiver  never take advice cant keep still all day and not being a pussycat i dont like to doze by the fire i like adventures and im going to find some  meg went back to toast her feet and read ivanhoe and jo began to dig paths with great energy the snow was light and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden for beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air now the garden separated the marches house from that of mr laurence both stood in a suburb of the city which was still countrylike with groves and lawns large gardens and quiet streets a low hedge parted the two estates on one side was an old brown house looking rather bare and shabby robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers which then surrounded it on the other side was a stately stone mansion plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury from the big coach house and wellkept grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains  yet it seemed a lonely lifeless sort of house for no children frolicked on the lawn no motherly face ever smiled at the windows and few people went in and out except the old gentleman and his grandson  to jos lively fancy this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed she had long wanted to behold these hidden glories and to know the laurence boy who looked as if he would like to be known if he only knew how to begin since the party she had been more eager than ever and had planned many ways of making friends with him but he had not been seen lately and jo began to think he had gone away when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window looking wistfully down into their garden where beth and amy were snowballing one another  that boy is suffering for society and fun she said to herself his grandpa does not know whats good for him and keeps him shut up all alone he needs a party of jolly boys to play with or somebody young and lively ive a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so  the idea amused jo who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing meg by her queer performances the plan of going over was not forgotten and when the snowy afternoon came jo resolved to try what could be done she saw mr lawrence drive off and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge where she paused and took a survey all quiet curtains down at the lower windows servants out of sight and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window  there he is thought jo poor boy all alone and sick this dismal day its a shame ill toss up a snowball and make him look out and then say a kind word to him  up went a handful of soft snow and the head turned at once showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute as the big eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile jo nodded and laughed and flourished her broom as she called out  how do you do are you sick  laurie opened the window and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven  better thank you ive had a bad cold and been shut up a week  im sorry what do you amuse yourself with  nothing its dull as tombs up here  dont you read  not much they wont let me  cant somebody read to you  grandpa does sometimes but my books dont interest him and i hate to ask brooke all the time  have someone come and see you then  there isnt anyone id like to see boys make such a row and my head is weak  isnt there some nice girl whod read and amuse you girls are quiet and like to play nurse  dont know any  you know us began jo then laughed and stopped  so i do will you come please cried laurie  im not quiet and nice but ill come if mother will let me ill go ask her shut the window like a good boy and wait till i come  with that jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house wondering what they would all say to her laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company and flew about to get ready for as mrs march said he was a little gentleman and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate putting on a fresh color and trying to tidy up the room which in spite of half a dozen servants was anything but neat presently there came a loud ring then a decided voice asking for mr laurie and a surprisedlooking servant came running up to announce a young lady  all right show her up its miss jo said laurie going to the door of his little parlor to meet jo who appeared looking rosy and quite at her ease with a covered dish in one hand and beths three kittens in the other  here i am bag and baggage she said briskly mother sent her love and was glad if i could do anything for you meg wanted me to bring some of her blanc mange she makes it very nicely and beth thought her cats would be comforting i knew youd laugh at them but i couldnt refuse she was so anxious to do something  it so happened that beths funny loan was just the thing for in laughing over the kits laurie forgot his bashfulness and grew sociable at once  that looks too pretty to eat he said smiling with pleasure as jo uncovered the dish and showed the blanc mange surrounded by a garland of green leaves and the scarlet flowers of amys pet geranium  it isnt anything only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it tell the girl to put it away for your tea its so simple you can eat it and being soft it will slip down without hurting your sore throat what a cozy room this is  it might be if it was kept nice but the maids are lazy and i dont know how to make them mind it worries me though  ill right it up in two minutes for it only needs to have the hearth brushed soand the things made straight on the mantelpiece soand the books put here and the bottles there and your sofa turned from the light and the pillows plumped up a bit now then youre fixed  and so he was for as she laughed and talked jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different air to the room laurie watched her in respectful silence and when she beckoned him to his sofa he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction saying gratefully  how kind you are yes thats what it wanted now please take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company  no i came to amuse you shall i read aloud and jo looked affectionately toward some inviting books near by  thank you ive read all those and if you dont mind id rather talk answered laurie  not a bit ill talk all day if youll only set me going beth says i never know when to stop  is beth the rosy one who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes out with a little basket asked laurie with interest  yes thats beth shes my girl and a regular good one she is too  the pretty one is meg and the curlyhaired one is amy i believe  how did you find that out  laurie colored up but answered frankly why you see i often hear you calling to one another and when im alone up here i cant help looking over at your house you always seem to be having such good times i beg your pardon for being so rude but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are and when the lamps are lighted its like looking at a picture to see the fire and you all around the table with your mother her face is right opposite and it looks so sweet behind the flowers i cant help watching it i havent got any mother you know and laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control  the solitary hungry look in his eyes went straight to jos warm heart she had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child laurie was sick and lonely and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness she gladly tried to share it with him her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said  well never draw that curtain any more and i give you leave to look as much as you like i just wish though instead of peeping youd come over and see us mother is so splendid shed do you heaps of good and beth would sing to you if i begged her to and amy would dance meg and i would make you laugh over our funny stage properties and wed have jolly times wouldnt your grandpa let you  i think he would if your mother asked him hes very kind though he does not look so and he lets me do what i like pretty much only hes afraid i might be a bother to strangers began laurie brightening more and more  we are not strangers we are neighbors and you neednt think youd be a bother we want to know you and ive been trying to do it this ever so long we havent been here a great while you know but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you  you see grandpa lives among his books and doesnt mind much what happens outside mr brooke my tutor doesnt stay here you know and i have no one to go about with me so i just stop at home and get on as i can  thats bad you ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere you are asked then youll have plenty of friends and pleasant places to go to never mind being bashful it wont last long if you keep going  laurie turned red again but wasnt offended at being accused of bashfulness for there was so much good will in jo it was impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant  do you like your school asked the boy changing the subject after a little pause during which he stared at the fire and jo looked about her well pleased  dont go to school im a businessmangirl i mean i go to wait on my greataunt and a dear cross old soul she is too answered jo  laurie opened his mouth to ask another question but remembering just in time that it wasnt manners to make too many inquiries into peoples affairs he shut it again and looked uncomfortable  jo liked his good breeding and didnt mind having a laugh at aunt march so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady her fat poodle the parrot that talked spanish and the library where she reveled  laurie enjoyed that immensely and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came once to woo aunt march and in the middle of a fine speech how poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks and a maid popped her head in to see what was the matter  oh that does me no end of good tell on please he said taking his face out of the sofa cushion red and shining with merriment  much elated with her success jo did tell on all about their plays and plans their hopes and fears for father and the most interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived then they got to talking about books and to jos delight she found that laurie loved them as well as she did and had read even more than herself  if you like them so much come down and see ours grandfather is out so you neednt be afraid said laurie getting up  im not afraid of anything returned jo with a toss of the head  i dont believe you are exclaimed the boy looking at her with much admiration though he privately thought she would have good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman if she met him in some of his moods  the atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike laurie led the way from room to room letting jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy and so at last they came to the library where she clapped her hands and pranced as she always did when especially delighted it was lined with books and there were pictures and statues and distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities and sleepy hollow chairs and queer tables and bronzes and best of all a great open fireplace with quaint tiles all round it  what richness sighed jo sinking into the depth of a velour chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction theodore laurence you ought to be the happiest boy in the world she added impressively  a fellow cant live on books said laurie shaking his head as he perched on a table opposite  before he could say more a bell rang and jo flew up exclaiming with alarm mercy me its your grandpa  well what if it is you are not afraid of anything you know returned the boy looking wicked  i think i am a little bit afraid of him but i dont know why i should be marmee said i might come and i dont think youre any the worse for it said jo composing herself though she kept her eyes on the door  im a great deal better for it and ever so much obliged im only afraid you are very tired of talking to me it was so pleasant i couldnt bear to stop said laurie gratefully  the doctor to see you sir and the maid beckoned as she spoke  would you mind if i left you for a minute i suppose i must see him said laurie  dont mind me im happy as a cricket here answered jo  laurie went away and his guest amused herself in her own way she was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door opened again and without turning she said decidedly im sure now that i shouldnt be afraid of him for hes got kind eyes though his mouth is grim and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own he isnt as handsome as my grandfather but i like him  thank you maam said a gruff voice behind her and there to her great dismay stood old mr laurence  poor jo blushed till she couldnt blush any redder and her heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said for a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her but that was cowardly and the girls would laugh at her so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could a second look showed her that the living eyes under the bushy eyebrows were kinder even than the painted ones and there was a sly twinkle in them which lessened her fear a good deal the gruff voice was gruffer than ever as the old gentleman said abruptly after the dreadful pause so youre not afraid of me hey  not much sir  and you dont think me as handsome as your grandfather  not quite sir  and ive got a tremendous will have i  i only said i thought so  but you like me in spite of it  yes i do sir  that answer pleased the old gentleman he gave a short laugh shook hands with her and putting his finger under her chin turned up her face examined it gravely and let it go saying with a nod youve got your grandfathers spirit if you havent his face he was a fine man my dear but what is better he was a brave and an honest one and i was proud to be his friend  thank you sir and jo was quite comfortable after that for it suited her exactly  what have you been doing to this boy of mine hey was the next question sharply put  only trying to be neighborly sir and jo told how her visit came about  you think he needs cheering up a bit do you  yes sir he seems a little lonely and young folks would do him good perhaps we are only girls but we should be glad to help if we could for we dont forget the splendid christmas present you sent us said jo eagerly  tut tut tut that was the boys affair how is the poor woman  doing nicely sir and off went jo talking very fast as she told all about the hummels in whom her mother had interested richer friends than they were  just her fathers way of doing good i shall come and see your mother some fine day tell her so theres the tea bell we have it early on the boys account come down and go on being neighborly  if youd like to have me sir  shouldnt ask you if i didnt and mr laurence offered her his arm with oldfashioned courtesy  what would meg say to this thought jo as she was marched away while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story at home  hey why what the dickens has come to the fellow said the old gentleman as laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of jo arm in arm with his redoubtable grandfather  i didnt know youd come sir he began as jo gave him a triumphant little glance  thats evident by the way you racket downstairs come to your tea sir and behave like a gentleman and having pulled the boys hair by way of a caress mr laurence walked on while laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from jo  the old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea but he watched the young people who soon chatted away like old friends and the change in his grandson did not escape him there was color light and life in the boys face now vivacity in his manner and genuine merriment in his laugh  shes right the lad is lonely ill see what these little girls can do for him thought mr laurence as he looked and listened he liked jo for her odd blunt ways suited him and she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself  if the laurences had been what jo called prim and poky she would not have got on at all for such people always made her shy and awkward but finding them free and easy she was so herself and made a good impression when they rose she proposed to go but laurie said he had something more to show her and took her away to the conservatory which had been lighted for her benefit it seemed quite fairylike to jo as she went up and down the walks enjoying the blooming walls on either side the soft light the damp sweet air and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her while her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full then he tied them up saying with the happy look jo liked to see please give these to your mother and tell her i like the medicine she sent me very much  they found mr laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing room but jos attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano which stood open  do you play she asked turning to laurie with a respectful expression  sometimes he answered modestly  please do now i want to hear it so i can tell beth  wont you first  dont know how too stupid to learn but i love music dearly  so laurie played and jo listened with her nose luxuriously buried in heliotrope and tea roses her respect and regard for the laurence boy increased very much for he played remarkably well and didnt put on any airs she wished beth could hear him but she did not say so only praised him till he was quite abashed and his grandfather came to his rescue  that will do that will do young lady too many sugarplums are not good for him his music isnt bad but i hope he will do as well in more important things going well im much obliged to you and i hope youll come again my respects to your mother good night doctor jo  he shook hands kindly but looked as if something did not please him when they got into the hall jo asked laurie if she had said something amiss he shook his head  no it was me he doesnt like to hear me play  why not  ill tell you some day john is going home with you as i cant  no need of that i am not a young lady and its only a step take care of yourself wont you  yes but you will come again i hope  if you promise to come and see us after you are well  i will  good night laurie  good night jo good night  when all the afternoons adventures had been told the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body for each found something very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge mrs march wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him meg longed to walk in the conservatory beth sighed for the grand piano and amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues  mother why didnt mr laurence like to have laurie play asked jo who was of an inquiring disposition  i am not sure but i think it was because his son lauries father married an italian lady a musician which displeased the old man who is very proud the lady was good and lovely and accomplished but he did not like her and never saw his son after he married they both died when laurie was a little child and then his grandfather took him home i fancy the boy who was born in italy is not very strong and the old man is afraid of losing him which makes him so careful laurie comes naturally by his love of music for he is like his mother and i dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician at any rate his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like and so he glowered as jo said  dear me how romantic exclaimed meg  how silly said jo let him be a musician if he wants to and not plague his life out sending him to college when he hates to go  thats why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners i suppose italians are always nice said meg who was a little sentimental  what do you know about his eyes and his manners you never spoke to him hardly cried jo who was not sentimental  i saw him at the party and what you tell shows that he knows how to behave that was a nice little speech about the medicine mother sent him  he meant the blanc mange i suppose  how stupid you are child he meant you of course  did he and jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before  i never saw such a girl you dont know a compliment when you get it said meg with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter  i think they are great nonsense and ill thank you not to be silly and spoil my fun lauries a nice boy and i like him and i wont have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish well all be good to him because he hasnt got any mother and he may come over and see us maynt he marmee  yes jo your little friend is very welcome and i hope meg will remember that children should be children as long as they can  i dont call myself a child and im not in my teens yet observed amy what do you say beth  i was thinking about our pilgrims progress answered beth who had not heard a word how we got out of the slough and through the wicket gate by resolving to be good and up the steep hill by trying and that maybe the house over there full of splendid things is going to be our palace beautiful  we have got to get by the lions first said jo as if she rather liked the prospect     chapter six beth finds the palace beautiful   the big house did prove a palace beautiful though it took some time for all to get in and beth found it very hard to pass the lions old mr laurence was the biggest one but after he had called said something funny or kind to each one of the girls and talked over old times with their mother nobody felt much afraid of him except timid beth the other lion was the fact that they were poor and laurie rich for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return but after a while they found that he considered them the benefactors and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for mrs marchs motherly welcome their cheerful society and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs so they soon forgot their pride and interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater  all sorts of pleasant things happened about that time for the new friendship flourished like grass in spring every one liked laurie and he privately informed his tutor that the marches were regularly splendid girls with the delightful enthusiasm of youth they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him and he found something very charming in the innocent companionship of these simplehearted girls never having known mother or sisters he was quick to feel the influences they brought about him and their busy lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led he was tired of books and found people so interesting now that mr brooke was obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports for laurie was always playing truant and running over to the marches  never mind let him take a holiday and make it up afterward said the old gentleman the good lady next door says he is studying too hard and needs young society amusement and exercise i suspect she is right and that ive been coddling the fellow as if id been his grandmother let him do what he likes as long as he is happy he cant get into mischief in that little nunnery over there and mrs march is doing more for him than we can  what good times they had to be sure such plays and tableaux such sleigh rides and skating frolics such pleasant evenings in the old parlor and now and then such gay little parties at the great house meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in bouquets jo browsed over the new library voraciously and convulsed the old gentleman with her criticisms amy copied pictures and enjoyed beauty to her hearts content and laurie played lord of the manor in the most delightful style  but beth though yearning for the grand piano could not pluck up courage to go to the mansion of bliss as meg called it she went once with jo but the old gentleman not being aware of her infirmity stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows and said hey so loud that he frightened her so much her feet chattered on the floor she never told her mother and she ran away declaring she would never go there any more not even for the dear piano no persuasions or enticements could overcome her fear till the fact coming to mr laurences ear in some mysterious way he set about mending matters during one of the brief calls he made he artfully led the conversation to music and talked away about great singers whom he had seen fine organs he had heard and told such charming anecdotes that beth found it impossible to stay in her distant corner but crept nearer and nearer as if fascinated at the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with excitement of this unusual performance taking no more notice of her than if she had been a fly mr laurence talked on about lauries lessons and teachers and presently as if the idea had just occurred to him he said to mrs march  the boy neglects his music now and im glad of it for he was getting too fond of it but the piano suffers for want of use wouldnt some of your girls like to run over and practice on it now and then just to keep it in tune you know maam  beth took a step forward and pressed her hands tightly together to keep from clapping them for this was an irresistible temptation and the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her breath away before mrs march could reply mr laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile  they neednt see or speak to anyone but run in at any time for im shut up in my study at the other end of the house laurie is out a great deal and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine oclock  here he rose as if going and beth made up her mind to speak for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired please tell the young ladies what i say and if they dont care to come why never mind here a little hand slipped into his and beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude as she said in her earnest yet timid way  oh sir they do care very very much  are you the musical girl he asked without any startling hey as he looked down at her very kindly  im beth i love it dearly and ill come if you are quite sure nobody will hear me and be disturbed she added fearing to be rude and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke  not a soul my dear the house is empty half the day so come and drum away as much as you like and i shall be obliged to you  how kind you are sir  beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore but she was not frightened now and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her the old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead and stooping down he kissed her saying in a tone few people ever heard  i had a little girl once with eyes like these god bless you my dear good day madam and away he went in a great hurry  beth had a rapture with her mother and then rushed up to impart the glorious news to her family of invalids as the girls were not home how blithely she sang that evening and how they all laughed at her because she woke amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in her sleep next day having seen both the old and young gentleman out of the house beth after two or three retreats fairly got in at the side door and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing room where her idol stood quite by accident of course some pretty easy music lay on the piano and with trembling fingers and frequent stops to listen and look about beth at last touched the great instrument and straightway forgot her fear herself and everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her for it was like the voice of a beloved friend  she stayed till hannah came to take her home to dinner but she had no appetite and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state of beatitude  after that the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every day and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that came and went unseen she never knew that mr laurence opened his study door to hear the oldfashioned airs he liked she never saw laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away she never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit and when he talked to her about music at home she only thought how kind he was to tell things that helped her so much so she enjoyed herself heartily and found what isnt always the case that her granted wish was all she had hoped perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was given her at any rate she deserved both  mother im going to work mr laurence a pair of slippers he is so kind to me i must thank him and i dont know any other way can i do it asked beth a few weeks after that eventful call of his  yes dear it will please him very much and be a nice way of thanking him the girls will help you about them and i will pay for the making up replied mrs march who took peculiar pleasure in granting beths requests because she so seldom asked anything for herself  after many serious discussions with meg and jo the pattern was chosen the materials bought and the slippers begun a cluster of grave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very appropriate and pretty and beth worked away early and late with occasional lifts over hard parts she was a nimble little needlewoman and they were finished before anyone got tired of them then she wrote a short simple note and with lauries help got them smuggled onto the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up  when this excitement was over beth waited to see what would happen all day passed and a part of the next before any acknowledgement arrived and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety friend on the afternoon of the second day she went out to do an errand and give poor joanna the invalid doll her daily exercise as she came up the street on her return she saw three yes four heads popping in and out of the parlor windows and the moment they saw her several hands were waved and several joyful voices screamed  heres a letter from the old gentleman come quick and read it  oh beth hes sent you began amy gesticulating with unseemly energy but she got no further for jo quenched her by slamming down the window  beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense at the door her sisters seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession all pointing and all saying at once look there look there beth did look and turned pale with delight and surprise for there stood a little cabinet piano with a letter lying on the glossy lid directed like a sign board to miss elizabeth march  for me gasped beth holding onto jo and feeling as if she should tumble down it was such an overwhelming thing altogether  yes all for you my precious isnt it splendid of him dont you think hes the dearest old man in the world heres the key in the letter we didnt open it but we are dying to know what he says cried jo hugging her sister and offering the note  you read it i cant i feel so queer oh it is too lovely and beth hid her face in jos apron quite upset by her present  jo opened the paper and began to laugh for the first words she saw were  miss march  dear madam  how nice it sounds i wish someone would write to me so said amy who thought the oldfashioned address very elegant  i have had many pairs of slippers in my life but i never had any that suited me so well as yours continues jo heartsease is my favorite flower and these will always remind me of the gentle giver i like to pay my debts so i know you will allow the old gentleman to send you something which once belonged to the little grand daughter he lost with hearty thanks and best wishes i remain your grateful friend and humble servant james laurence  there beth thats an honor to be proud of im sure laurie told me how fond mr laurence used to be of the child who died and how he kept all her little things carefully just think hes given you her piano that comes of having big blue eyes and loving music said jo trying to soothe beth who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever been before  see the cunning brackets to hold candles and the nice green silk puckered up with a gold rose in the middle and the pretty rack and stool all complete added meg opening the instrument and displaying its beauties  your humble servant james laurence only think of his writing that to you ill tell the girls theyll think its splendid said amy much impressed by the note  try it honey lets hear the sound of the baby pianny said hannah who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows  so beth tried it and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano ever heard it had evidently been newly tuned and put in applepie order but perfect as it was i think the real charm lay in the happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it as beth lovingly touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright pedals  youll have to go and thank him said jo by way of a joke for the idea of the childs really going never entered her head  yes i mean to i guess ill go now before i get frightened thinking about it and to the utter amazement of the assembled family beth walked deliberately down the garden through the hedge and in at the laurences door  well i wish i may die if it aint the queerest thing i ever see the pianny has turned her head shed never have gone in her right mind cried hannah staring after her while the girls were rendered quite speechless by the miracle  they would have been still more amazed if they had seen what beth did afterward if you will believe me she went and knocked at the study door before she gave herself time to think and when a gruff voice called out come in she did go in right up to mr laurence who looked quite taken aback and held out her hand saying with only a small quaver in her voice i came to thank you sir for but she didnt finish for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech and only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved she put both arms round his neck and kissed him  if the roof of the house had suddenly flown off the old gentleman wouldnt have been more astonished but he liked it oh dear yes he liked it amazingly and was so touched and pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness vanished and he just set her on his knee and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one feeling as if he had got his own little granddaughter back again beth ceased to fear him from that moment and sat there talking to him as cozily as if she had known him all her life for love casts out fear and gratitude can conquer pride when she went home he walked with her to her own gate shook hands cordially and touched his hat as he marched back again looking very stately and erect like a handsome soldierly old gentleman as he was  when the girls saw that performance jo began to dance a jig by way of expressing her satisfaction amy nearly fell out of the window in her surprise and meg exclaimed with uplifted hands well i do believe the world is coming to an end     chapter seven amys valley of humiliation   that boy is a perfect cyclops isnt he said amy one day as laurie clattered by on horseback with a flourish of his whip as he passed  how dare you say so when hes got both his eyes and very handsome ones they are too cried jo who resented any slighting remarks about her friend  i didnt say anything about his eyes and i dont see why you need fire up when i admire his riding  oh my goodness that little goose means a centaur and she called him a cyclops exclaimed jo with a burst of laughter  you neednt be so rude its only a lapse of lingy as mr davis says retorted amy finishing jo with her latin i just wish i had a little of the money laurie spends on that horse she added as if to herself yet hoping her sisters would hear  why asked meg kindly for jo had gone off in another laugh at amys second blunder  i need it so much im dreadfully in debt and it wont be my turn to have the rag money for a month  in debt amy what do you mean and meg looked sober  why i owe at least a dozen pickled limes and i cant pay them you know till i have money for marmee forbade my having anything charged at the shop  tell me all about it are limes the fashion now it used to be pricking bits of rubber to make balls and meg tried to keep her countenance amy looked so grave and important  why you see the girls are always buying them and unless you want to be thought mean you must do it too its nothing but limes now for everyone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime and trading them off for pencils bead rings paper dolls or something else at recess if one girl likes another she gives her a lime if shes mad with her she eats one before her face and doesnt offer even a suck they treat by turns and ive had ever so many but havent returned them and i ought for they are debts of honor you know  how much will pay them off and restore your credit asked meg taking out her purse  a quarter would more than do it and leave a few cents over for a treat for you dont you like limes  not much you may have my share heres the money make it last as long as you can for it isnt very plenty you know  oh thank you it must be so nice to have pocket money ill have a grand feast for i havent tasted a lime this week i felt delicate about taking any as i couldnt return them and im actually suffering for one  next day amy was rather late at school but could not resist the temptation of displaying with pardonable pride a moist brownpaper parcel before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk during the next few minutes the rumor that amy march had got twentyfour delicious limes she ate one on the way and was going to treat circulated through her set and the attentions of her friends became quite overwhelming katy brown invited her to her next party on the spot mary kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess and jenny snow a satirical young lady who had basely twitted amy upon her limeless state promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish answers to certain appalling sums but amy had not forgotten miss snows cutting remarks about some persons whose noses were not too flat to smell other peoples limes and stuckup people who were not too proud to ask for them and she instantly crushed that snow girls hopes by the withering telegram you neednt be so polite all of a sudden for you wont get any  a distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning and amys beautifully drawn maps received praise which honor to her foe rankled in the soul of miss snow and caused miss march to assume the airs of a studious young peacock but alas alas pride goes before a fall and the revengeful snow turned the tables with disastrous success no sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments and bowed himself out than jenny under pretense of asking an important question informed mr davis the teacher that amy march had pickled limes in her desk  now mr davis had declared limes a contraband article and solemnly vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the law this muchenduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum after a long and stormy war had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and newspapers had suppressed a private post office had forbidden distortions of the face nicknames and caricatures and done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order boys are trying enough to human patience goodness knows but girls are infinitely more so especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than dr blimber mr davis knew any quantity of greek latin algebra and ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine teacher and manners morals feelings and examples were not considered of any particular importance it was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing amy and jenny knew it mr davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning there was an east wind which always affected his neuralgia and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he deserved therefore to use the expressive if not elegant language of a schoolgirl he was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear the word limes was like fire to powder his yellow face flushed and he rapped on his desk with an energy which made jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity  young ladies attention if you please  at the stern order the buzz ceased and fifty pairs of blue black gray and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance  miss march come to the desk  amy rose to comply with outward composure but a secret fear oppressed her for the limes weighed upon her conscience  bring with you the limes you have in your desk was the unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of her seat  dont take all whispered her neighbor a young lady of great presence of mind  amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before mr davis feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when that delicious perfume met his nose unfortunately mr davis particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle and disgust added to his wrath  is that all  not quite stammered amy  bring the rest immediately  with a despairing glance at her set she obeyed  you are sure there are no more  i never lie sir  so i see now take these disgusting things two by two and throw them out of the window  there was a simultaneous sigh which created quite a little gust as the last hope fled and the treat was ravished from their longing lips scarlet with shame and anger amy went to and fro six dreadful times and as each doomed couple looking oh so plump and juicy fell from her reluctant hands a shout from the street completed the anguish of the girls for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the little irish children who were their sworn foes thisthis was too much all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable davis and one passionate lime lover burst into tears  as amy returned from her last trip mr davis gave a portentous hem and said in his most impressive manner  young ladies you remember what i said to you a week ago i am sorry this has happened but i never allow my rules to be infringed and i never break my word miss march hold out your hand  amy started and put both hands behind her turning on him an imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter she was rather a favorite with old davis as of course he was called and its my private belief that he would have broken his word if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in a hiss that hiss faint as it was irritated the irascible gentleman and sealed the culprits fate  your hand miss march was the only answer her mute appeal received and too proud to cry or beseech amy set her teeth threw back her head defiantly and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her little palm they were neither many nor heavy but that made no difference to her for the first time in her life she had been struck and the disgrace in her eyes was as deep as if he had knocked her down  you will now stand on the platform till recess said mr davis resolved to do the thing thoroughly since he had begun  that was dreadful it would have been bad enough to go to her seat and see the pitying faces of her friends or the satisfied ones of her few enemies but to face the whole school with that shame fresh upon her seemed impossible and for a second she felt as if she could only drop down where she stood and break her heart with crying a bitter sense of wrong and the thought of jenny snow helped her to bear it and taking the ignominious place she fixed her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces and stood there so motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that pathetic figure before them  during the fifteen minutes that followed the proud and sensitive little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot to others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair but to her it was a hard experience for during the twelve years of her life she had been governed by love alone and a blow of that sort had never touched her before the smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten in the sting of the thought i shall have to tell at home and they will be so disappointed in me  the fifteen minutes seemed an hour but they came to an end at last and the word recess had never seemed so welcome to her before  you can go miss march said mr davis looking as he felt uncomfortable  he did not soon forget the reproachful glance amy gave him as she went without a word to anyone straight into the anteroom snatched her things and left the place forever as she passionately declared to herself she was in a sad state when she got home and when the older girls arrived some time later an indignation meeting was held at once mrs march did not say much but looked disturbed and comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner meg bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears beth felt that even her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this jo wrathfully proposed that mr davis be arrested without delay and hannah shook her fist at the villain and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him under her pestle  no notice was taken of amys flight except by her mates but the sharpeyed demoiselles discovered that mr davis was quite benignant in the afternoon also unusually nervous just before school closed jo appeared wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk and delivered a letter from her mother then collected amys property and departed carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat as if she shook the dust of the place off her feet  yes you can have a vacation from school but i want you to study a little every day with beth said mrs march that evening i dont approve of corporal punishment especially for girls i dislike mr daviss manner of teaching and dont think the girls you associate with are doing you any good so i shall ask your fathers advice before i send you anywhere else  thats good i wish all the girls would leave and spoil his old school its perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes sighed amy with the air of a martyr  i am not sorry you lost them for you broke the rules and deserved some punishment for disobedience was the severe reply which rather disappointed the young lady who expected nothing but sympathy  do you mean you are glad i was disgraced before the whole school cried amy  i should not have chosen that way of mending a fault replied her mother but im not sure that it wont do you more good than a bolder method you are getting to be rather conceited my dear and it is quite time you set about correcting it you have a good many little gifts and virtues but there is no need of parading them for conceit spoils the finest genius there is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long even if it is the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one and the great charm of all power is modesty  so it is cried laurie who was playing chess in a corner with jo i knew a girl once who had a really remarkable talent for music and she didnt know it never guessed what sweet little things she composed when she was alone and wouldnt have believed it if anyone had told her  i wish id known that nice girl maybe she would have helped me im so stupid said beth who stood beside him listening eagerly  you do know her and she helps you better than anyone else could answered laurie looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his merry black eyes that beth suddenly turned very red and hid her face in the sofa cushion quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery  jo let laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her beth who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment so laurie did his best and sang delightfully being in a particularly lively humor for to the marches he seldom showed the moody side of his character when he was gone amy who had been pensive all evening said suddenly as if busy over some new idea is laurie an accomplished boy  yes he has had an excellent education and has much talent he will make a fine man if not spoiled by petting replied her mother  and he isnt conceited is he asked amy  not in the least that is why he is so charming and we all like him so much  i see its nice to have accomplishments and be elegant but not to show off or get perked up said amy thoughtfully  these things are always seen and felt in a persons manner and conversations if modestly used but it is not necessary to display them said mrs march  any more than its proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and ribbons at once that folks may know youve got them added jo and the lecture ended in a laugh     chapter eight jo meets apollyon   girls where are you going asked amy coming into their room one saturday afternoon and finding them getting ready to go out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity  never mind little girls shouldnt ask questions returned jo sharply  now if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are young it is to be told that and to be bidden to run away dear is still more trying to us amy bridled up at this insult and determined to find out the secret if she teased for an hour turning to meg who never refused her anything very long she said coaxingly do tell me i should think you might let me go too for beth is fussing over her piano and i havent got anything to do and am so lonely  i cant dear because you arent invited began meg but jo broke in impatiently now meg be quiet or you will spoil it all you cant go amy so dont be a baby and whine about it  you are going somewhere with laurie i know you are you were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night and you stopped when i came in arent you going with him  yes we are now do be still and stop bothering  amy held her tongue but used her eyes and saw meg slip a fan into her pocket  i know i know youre going to the theater to see the seven castles she cried adding resolutely and i shall go for mother said i might see it and ive got my rag money and it was mean not to tell me in time  just listen to me a minute and be a good child said meg soothingly mother doesnt wish you to go this week because your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece next week you can go with beth and hannah and have a nice time  i dont like that half as well as going with you and laurie please let me ive been sick with this cold so long and shut up im dying for some fun do meg ill be ever so good pleaded amy looking as pathetic as she could  suppose we take her i dont believe mother would mind if we bundle her up well began meg  if she goes i shant and if i dont laurie wont like it and it will be very rude after he invited only us to go and drag in amy i should think shed hate to poke herself where she isnt wanted said jo crossly for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy herself  her tone and manner angered amy who began to put her boots on saying in her most aggravating way i shall go meg says i may and if i pay for myself laurie hasnt anything to do with it  you cant sit with us for our seats are reserved and you mustnt sit alone so laurie will give you his place and that will spoil our pleasure or hell get another seat for you and that isnt proper when you werent asked you shant stir a step so you may just stay where you are scolded jo crosser than ever having just pricked her finger in her hurry  sitting on the floor with one boot on amy began to cry and meg to reason with her when laurie called from below and the two girls hurried down leaving their sister wailing for now and then she forgot her grownup ways and acted like a spoiled child just as the party was setting out amy called over the banisters in a threatening tone youll be sorry for this jo march see if you aint  fiddlesticks returned jo slamming the door  they had a charming time for the seven castles of the diamond lake was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish but in spite of the comical red imps sparkling elves and the gorgeous princes and princesses jos pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it the fairy queens yellow curls reminded her of amy and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her sorry for it she and amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives for both had quick tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly roused amy teased jo and jo irritated amy and semioccasional explosions occurred of which both were much ashamed afterward although the oldest jo had the least selfcontrol and had hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting her into trouble her anger never lasted long and having humbly confessed her fault she sincerely repented and tried to do better her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get jo into a fury because she was such an angel afterward poor jo tried desperately to be good but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her and it took years of patient effort to subdue it  when they got home they found amy reading in the parlor she assumed an injured air as they came in never lifted her eyes from her book or asked a single question perhaps curiosity might have conquered resentment if beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing description of the play on going up to put away her best hat jos first look was toward the bureau for in their last quarrel amy had soothed her feelings by turning jos top drawer upside down on the floor everything was in its place however and after a hasty glance into her various closets bags and boxes jo decided that amy had forgiven and forgotten her wrongs  there jo was mistaken for next day she made a discovery which produced a tempest meg beth and amy were sitting together late in the afternoon when jo burst into the room looking excited and demanding breathlessly has anyone taken my book  meg and beth said no at once and looked surprised amy poked the fire and said nothing jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in a minute  amy youve got it  no i havent  you know where it is then  no i dont  thats a fib cried jo taking her by the shoulders and looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than amy  it isnt i havent got it dont know where it is now and dont care  you know something about it and youd better tell at once or ill make you and jo gave her a slight shake  scold as much as you like youll never see your silly old book again cried amy getting excited in her turn  why not  i burned it up  what my little book i was so fond of and worked over and meant to finish before father got home have you really burned it said jo turning very pale while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched amy nervously  yes i did i told you id make you pay for being so cross yesterday and i have so  amy got no farther for jos hot temper mastered her and she shook amy till her teeth chattered in her head crying in a passion of grief and anger  you wicked wicked girl i never can write it again and ill never forgive you as long as i live  meg flew to rescue amy and beth to pacify jo but jo was quite beside herself and with a parting box on her sisters ear she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret and finished her fight alone  the storm cleared up below for mrs march came home and having heard the story soon brought amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her sister jos book was the pride of her heart and was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great promise it was only half a dozen little fairy tales but jo had worked over them patiently putting her whole heart into her work hoping to make something good enough to print she had just copied them with great care and had destroyed the old manuscript so that amys bonfire had consumed the loving work of several years it seemed a small loss to others but to jo it was a dreadful calamity and she felt that it never could be made up to her beth mourned as for a departed kitten and meg refused to defend her pet mrs march looked grave and grieved and amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of them  when the tea bell rang jo appeared looking so grim and unapproachable that it took all amys courage to say meekly  please forgive me jo im very very sorry  i never shall forgive you was jos stern answer and from that moment she ignored amy entirely  no one spoke of the great trouble not even mrs march for all had learned by experience that when jo was in that mood words were wasted and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident or her own generous nature softened jos resentment and healed the breach it was not a happy evening for though they sewed as usual while their mother read aloud from bremer scott or edgeworth something was wanting and the sweet home peace was disturbed they felt this most when singing time came for beth could only play jo stood dumb as a stone and amy broke down so meg and mother sang alone but in spite of their efforts to be as cheery as larks the flutelike voices did not seem to chord as well as usual and all felt out of tune  as jo received her goodnight kiss mrs march whispered gently my dear dont let the sun go down upon your anger forgive each other help each other and begin again tomorrow  jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom and cry her grief and anger all away but tears were an unmanly weakness and she felt so deeply injured that she really couldnt quite forgive yet so she winked hard shook her head and said gruffly because amy was listening it was an abominable thing and she doesnt deserve to be forgiven  with that she marched off to bed and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night  amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed and began to wish she had not humbled herself to feel more injured than ever and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating jo still looked like a thunder cloud and nothing went well all day it was bitter cold in the morning she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter aunt march had an attack of the fidgets meg was sensitive beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home and amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking about being good and yet wouldnt even try when other people set them a virtuous example  everybody is so hateful ill ask laurie to go skating he is always kind and jolly and will put me to rights i know said jo to herself and off she went  amy heard the clash of skates and looked out with an impatient exclamation  there she promised i should go next time for this is the last ice we shall have but its no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me  dont say that you were very naughty and it is hard to forgive the loss of her precious little book but i think she might do it now and i guess she will if you try her at the right minute said meg go after them dont say anything till jo has got goodnatured with laurie than take a quiet minute and just kiss her or do some kind thing and im sure shell be friends again with all her heart  ill try said amy for the advice suited her and after a flurry to get ready she ran after the friends who were just disappearing over the hill  it was not far to the river but both were ready before amy reached them jo saw her coming and turned her back laurie did not see for he was carefully skating along the shore sounding the ice for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap  ill go on to the first bend and see if its all right before we begin to race amy heard him say as he shot away looking like a young russian in his furtrimmed coat and cap  jo heard amy panting after her run stamping her feet and blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on but jo never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river taking a bitter unhappy sort of satisfaction in her sisters troubles she had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession of her as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once as laurie turned the bend he shouted back  keep near the shore it isnt safe in the middle jo heard but amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word jo glanced over her shoulder and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear  no matter whether she heard or not let her take care of herself  laurie had vanished round the bend jo was just at the turn and amy far behind striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the river for a minute jo stood still with a strange feeling in her heart then she resolved to go on but something held and turned her round just in time to see amy throw up her hands and go down with a sudden crash of rotten ice the splash of water and a cry that made jos heart stand still with fear she tried to call laurie but her voice was gone she tried to rush forward but her feet seemed to have no strength in them and for a second she could only stand motionless staring with a terrorstricken face at the little blue hood above the black water something rushed swiftly by her and lauries voice cried out  bring a rail quick quick  how she did it she never knew but for the next few minutes she worked as if possessed blindly obeying laurie who was quite selfpossessed and lying flat held amy up by his arm and hockey stick till jo dragged a rail from the fence and together they got the child out more frightened than hurt  now then we must walk her home as fast as we can pile our things on her while i get off these confounded skates cried laurie wrapping his coat round amy and tugging away at the straps which never seemed so intricate before  shivering dripping and crying they got amy home and after an exciting time of it she fell asleep rolled in blankets before a hot fire during the bustle jo had scarcely spoken but flown about looking pale and wild with her things half off her dress torn and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles when amy was comfortably asleep the house quiet and mrs march sitting by the bed she called jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands  are you sure she is safe whispered jo looking remorsefully at the golden head which might have been swept away from her sight forever under the treacherous ice  quite safe dear she is not hurt and wont even take cold i think you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly replied her mother cheerfully  laurie did it all i only let her go mother if she should die it would be my fault and jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of penitent tears telling all that had happened bitterly condemning her hardness of heart and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her  its my dreadful temper i try to cure it i think i have and then it breaks out worse than ever oh mother what shall i do what shall i do cried poor jo in despair  watch and pray dear never get tired of trying and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault said mrs march drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that jo cried even harder  you dont know you cant guess how bad it is it seems as if i could do anything when im in a passion i get so savage i could hurt anyone and enjoy it im afraid i shall do something dreadful some day and spoil my life and make everybody hate me oh mother help me do help me  i will my child i will dont cry so bitterly but remember this day and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another like it jo dear we all have our temptations some far greater than yours and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them you think your temper is the worst in the world but mine used to be just like it  yours mother why you are never angry and for the moment jo forgot remorse in surprise  ive been trying to cure it for forty years and have only succeeded in controlling it i am angry nearly every day of my life jo but i have learned not to show it and i still hope to learn not to feel it though it may take me another forty years to do so  the patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better lesson to jo than the wisest lecture the sharpest reproof she felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her the knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers and tried to mend it made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a girl of fifteen  mother are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go out of the room sometimes when aunt march scolds or people worry you asked jo feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before  yes ive learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips and when i feel that they mean to break out against my will i just go away for a minute and give myself a little shake for being so weak and wicked answered mrs march with a sigh and a smile as she smoothed and fastened up jos disheveled hair  how did you learn to keep still that is what troubles me for the sharp words fly out before i know what im about and the more i say the worse i get till its a pleasure to hurt peoples feelings and say dreadful things tell me how you do it marmee dear  my good mother used to help me  as you do us interrupted jo with a grateful kiss  but i lost her when i was a little older than you are and for years had to struggle on alone for i was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else i had a hard time jo and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures for in spite of my efforts i never seemed to get on then your father came and i was so happy that i found it easy to be good but byandby when i had four little daughters round me and we were poor then the old trouble began again for i am not patient by nature and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything  poor mother what helped you then  your father jo he never loses patience never doubts or complains but always hopes and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him he helped and comforted me and showed me that i must try to practice all the virtues i would have my little girls possess for i was their example it was easier to try for your sakes than for my own a startled or surprised look from one of you when i spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done and the love respect and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward i could receive for my efforts to be the woman i would have them copy  oh mother if im ever half as good as you i shall be satisfied cried jo much touched  i hope you will be a great deal better dear but you must keep watch over your bosom enemy as father calls it or it may sadden if not spoil your life you have had a warning remember it and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known today  i will try mother i truly will but you must help me remind me and keep me from flying out i used to see father sometimes put his finger on his lips and look at you with a very kind but sober face and you always folded your lips tight and went away was he reminding you then asked jo softly  yes i asked him to help me so and he never forgot it but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look  jo saw that her mothers eyes filled and her lips trembled as she spoke and fearing that she had said too much she whispered anxiously was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it i didnt mean to be rude but its so comfortable to say all i think to you and feel so safe and happy here  my jo you may say anything to your mother for it is my greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how much i love them  i thought id grieved you  no dear but speaking of father reminded me how much i miss him how much i owe him and how faithfully i should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him  yet you told him to go mother and didnt cry when he went and never complain now or seem as if you needed any help said jo wondering  i gave my best to the country i love and kept my tears till he was gone why should i complain when we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end if i dont seem to need help it is because i have a better friend even than father to comfort and sustain me my child the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning and may be many but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your heavenly father as you do that of your earthly one the more you love and trust him the nearer you will feel to him and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom his love and care never tire or change can never be taken from you but may become the source of lifelong peace happiness and strength believe this heartily and go to god with all your little cares and hopes and sins and sorrows as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother  jos only answer was to hold her mother close and in the silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart without words for in that sad yet happy hour she had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair but the sweetness of selfdenial and selfcontrol and led by her mothers hand she had drawn nearer to the friend who always welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of any father tenderer than that of any mother  amy stirred and sighed in her sleep and as if eager to begin at once to mend her fault jo looked up with an expression on her face which it had never worn before  i let the sun go down on my anger i wouldnt forgive her and today if it hadnt been for laurie it might have been too late how could i be so wicked said jo half aloud as she leaned over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow  as if she heard amy opened her eyes and held out her arms with a smile that went straight to jos heart neither said a word but they hugged one another close in spite of the blankets and everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss     chapter nine meg goes to vanity fair   i do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those children should have the measles just now said meg one april day as she stood packing the go abroady trunk in her room surrounded by her sisters  and so nice of annie moffat not to forget her promise a whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid replied jo looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms  and such lovely weather im so glad of that added beth tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box lent for the great occasion  i wish i was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice things said amy with her mouth full of pins as she artistically replenished her sisters cushion  i wish you were all going but as you cant i shall keep my adventures to tell you when i come back im sure its the least i can do when you have been so kind lending me things and helping me get ready said meg glancing round the room at the very simple outfit which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes  what did mother give you out of the treasure box asked amy who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which mrs march kept a few relics of past splendor as gifts for her girls when the proper time came  a pair of silk stockings that pretty carved fan and a lovely blue sash i wanted the violet silk but there isnt time to make it over so i must be contented with my old tarlaton   it will look nice over my new muslin skirt and the sash will set it off beautifully i wish i hadnt smashed my coral bracelet for you might have had it said jo who loved to give and lend but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use  there is a lovely oldfashioned pearl set in the treasure chest but mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl and laurie promised to send me all i want replied meg now let me see theres my new gray walking suit just curl up the feather in my hat beth then my poplin for sunday and the small party it looks heavy for spring doesnt it the violet silk would be so nice oh dear  never mind youve got the tarlaton for the big party and you always look like an angel in white said amy brooding over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted  it isnt lownecked and it doesnt sweep enough but it will have to do my blue housedress looks so well turned and freshly trimmed that i feel as if id got a new one my silk sacque isnt a bit the fashion and my bonnet doesnt look like sallies i didnt like to say anything but i was sadly disappointed in my umbrella i told mother black with a white handle but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish handle its strong and neat so i ought not to complain but i know i shall feel ashamed of it beside annies silk one with a gold top sighed meg surveying the little umbrella with great disfavor  change it advised jo  i wont be so silly or hurt marmees feelings when she took so much pains to get my things its a nonsensical notion of mine and im not going to give up to it my silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort you are a dear to lend me yours jo i feel so rich and sort of elegant with two new pairs and the old ones cleaned up for common and meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box  annie moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps would you put some on mine she asked as beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins fresh from hannahs hands  no i wouldnt for the smart caps wont match the plain gowns without any trimming on them poor folks shouldnt rig said jo decidedly  i wonder if i shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps said meg impatiently  you said the other day that youd be perfectly happy if you could only go to annie moffats observed beth in her quiet way  so i did well i am happy and i wont fret but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wants doesnt it there now the trays are ready and everything in but my ball dress which i shall leave for mother to pack said meg cheering up as she glanced from the halffilled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlaton which she called her ball dress with an important air  the next day was fine and meg departed in style for a fortnight of novelty and pleasure mrs march had consented to the visit rather reluctantly fearing that margaret would come back more discontented than she went but she begged so hard and sallie had promised to take good care of her and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life  the moffats were very fashionable and simple meg was rather daunted at first by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its occupants but they were kindly people in spite of the frivolous life they led and soon put their guest at her ease perhaps meg felt without understanding why that they were not particularly cultivated or intelligent people and that all their gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which they were made it certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously drive in a fine carriage wear her best frock every day and do nothing but enjoy herself it suited her exactly and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her to put on little airs and graces use french phrases crimp her hair take in her dresses and talk about the fashions as well as she could the more she saw of annie moffats pretty things the more she envied her and sighed to be rich home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it work grew harder than ever and she felt that she was a very destitute and muchinjured girl in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings  she had not much time for repining however for the three young girls were busily employed in having a good time they shopped walked rode and called all day went to theaters and operas or frolicked at home in the evening for annie had many friends and knew how to entertain them her older sisters were very fine young ladies and one was engaged which was extremely interesting and romantic meg thought mr moffat was a fat jolly old gentleman who knew her father and mrs moffat a fat jolly old lady who took as great a fancy to meg as her daughter had done everyone petted her and daisey as they called her was in a fair way to have her head turned  when the evening for the small party came she found that the poplin wouldnt do at all for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed so out came the tarlatan looking older limper and shabbier than ever beside sallies crisp new one meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another and her cheeks began to burn for with all her gentleness she was very proud no one said a word about it but sallie offered to dress her hair and annie to tie her sash and belle the engaged sister praised her white arms but in their kindness meg saw only pity for her poverty and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself while the others laughed chattered and flew about like gauzy butterflies the hard bitter feeling was getting pretty bad when the maid brought in a box of flowers before she could speak annie had the cover off and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses heath and fern within  its for belle of course george always sends her some but these are altogether ravishing cried annie with a great sniff  they are for miss march the man said and heres a note put in the maid holding it to meg  what fun who are they from didnt know you had a lover cried the girls fluttering about meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise  the note is from mother and the flowers from laurie said meg simply yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her  oh indeed said annie with a funny look as meg slipped the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy vanity and false pride for the few loving words had done her good and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty  feeling almost happy again she laid by a few ferns and roses for herself and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the breasts hair or skirts of her friends offering them so prettily that clara the elder sister told her she was the sweetest little thing she ever saw and they looked quite charmed with her small attention somehow the kind act finished her despondency and when all the rest went to show themselves to mrs moffat she saw a happy brighteyed face in the mirror as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened the roses in the dress that didnt strike her as so very shabby now  she enjoyed herself very much that evening for she danced to her hearts content everyone was very kind and she had three compliments annie made her sing and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice major lincoln asked who the fresh little girl with the beautiful eyes was and mr moffat insisted on dancing with her because she didnt dawdle but had some spring in her as he gracefully expressed it so altogether she had a very nice time till she overheard a bit of conversation which disturbed her extremely she was sitting just inside the conservatory waiting for her partner to bring her an ice when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall  how old is he  sixteen or seventeen i should say replied another voice  it would be a grand thing for one of those girls wouldnt it sallie says they are very intimate now and the old man quite dotes on them  mrs m has made her plans i dare say and will play her cards well early as it is the girl evidently doesnt think of it yet said mrs moffat  she told that fib about her momma as if she did know and colored up when the flowers came quite prettily poor thing shed be so nice if she was only got up in style do you think shed be offended if we offered to lend her a dress for thursday asked another voice  shes proud but i dont believe shed mind for that dowdy tarlaton is all she has got she may tear it tonight and that will be a good excuse for offering a decent one  here megs partner appeared to find her looking much flushed and rather agitated she was proud and her pride was useful just then for it helped her hide her mortification anger and disgust at what she had just heard for innocent and unsuspicious as she was she could not help understanding the gossip of her friends she tried to forget it but could not and kept repeating to herself mrs m has made her plans that fib about her mamma and dowdy tarlaton till she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice as that was impossible she did her best to seem gay and being rather excited she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making she was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears those foolish yet well meant words had opened a new world to meg and much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived as happily as a child her innocent friendship with laurie was spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard her faith in her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by mrs moffat who judged others by herself and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor mans daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven  poor meg had a restless night and got up heavyeyed unhappy half resentful toward her friends and half ashamed of herself for not speaking out frankly and setting everything right everybody dawdled that morning and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even to take up their worsted work something in the manner of her friends struck meg at once they treated her with more respect she thought took quite a tender interest in what she said and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity all this surprised and flattered her though she did not understand it till miss belle looked up from her writing and said with a sentimental air  daisy dear ive sent an invitation to your friend mr laurence for thursday we should like to know him and its only a proper compliment to you  meg colored but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply demurely you are very kind but im afraid he wont come  why not cherie asked miss belle  hes too old  my child what do you mean what is his age i beg to know cried miss clara  nearly seventy i believe answered meg counting stitches to hide the merriment in her eyes  you sly creature of course we meant the young man exclaimed miss belle laughing  there isnt any laurie is only a little boy and meg laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed lover  about your age nan said  nearer my sister jos i am seventeen in august returned meg tossing her head  its very nice of him to send you flowers isnt it said annie looking wise about nothing  yes he often does to all of us for their house is full and we are so fond of them my mother and old mr laurence are friends you know so it is quite natural that we children should play together and meg hoped they would say no more  its evident daisy isnt out yet said miss clara to belle with a nod  quite a pastoral state of innocence all round returned miss belle with a shrug  im going out to get some little matters for my girls can i do anything for you young ladies asked mrs moffat lumbering in like an elephant in silk and lace  no thank you maam replied sallie ive got my new pink silk for thursday and dont want a thing  nor i began meg but stopped because it occurred to her that she did want several things and could not have them  what shall you wear asked sallie  my old white one again if i can mend it fit to be seen it got sadly torn last night said meg trying to speak quite easily but feeling very uncomfortable  why dont you send home for another said sallie who was not an observing young lady  i havent got any other it cost meg an effort to say that but sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise only that how funny she did not finish her speech for belle shook her head at her and broke in saying kindly  not at all where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isnt out yet theres no need of sending home daisy even if you had a dozen for ive got a sweet blue silk laid away which ive outgrown and you shall wear it to please me wont you dear  you are very kind but i dont mind my old dress if you dont it does well enough for a little girl like me said meg  now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style i admire to do it and youd be a regular little beauty with a touch here and there i shant let anyone see you till you are done and then well burst upon them like cinderella and her godmother going to the ball said belle in her persuasive tone  meg couldnt refuse the offer so kindly made for a desire to see if she would be a little beauty after touching up caused her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the moffats  on the thursday evening belle shut herself up with her maid and between them they turned meg into a fine lady they crimped and curled her hair they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder and hortense would have added a soupcon of rouge if meg had not rebelled they laced her into a skyblue dress which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest meg blushed at herself in the mirror a set of silver filagree was added bracelets necklace brooch and even earrings for hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show a cluster of tearose buds at the bosom and a ruche reconciled meg to the display of her pretty white shoulders and a pair of highheeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart a lace handkerchief a plumy fan and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off and miss belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll  mademoiselle is charmante tres jolie is she not cried hortense clasping her hands in an affected rapture  come and show yourself said miss belle leading the way to the room where the others were waiting  as meg went rustling after with her long skirts trailing her earrings tinkling her curls waving and her heart beating she felt as if her fun had really begun at last for the mirror had plainly told her that she was a little beauty her friends repeated the pleasing phrase enthusiastically and for several minutes she stood like a jackdaw in the fable enjoying her borrowed plumes while the rest chattered like a party of magpies  while i dress do you drill her nan in the management of her skirt and those french heels or she will trip herself up take your silver butterfly and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head clara and dont any of you disturb the charming work of my hands said belle as she hurried away looking well pleased with her success  you dont look a bit like yourself but you are very nice im nowhere beside you for belle has heaps of taste and youre quite french i assure you let your flowers hang dont be so careful of them and be sure you dont trip returned sallie trying not to care that meg was prettier than herself  keeping that warning carefully in mind margaret got safely down stairs and sailed into the drawing rooms where the moffats and a few early guests were assembled she very soon discovered that there is a charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures their respect several young ladies who had taken no notice of her before were very affectionate all of a sudden several young gentlemen who had only stared at her at the other party now not only stared but asked to be introduced and said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her and several old ladies who sat on the sofas and criticized the rest of the party inquired who she was with an air of interest she heard mrs moffat reply to one of them  daisy marchfather a colonel in the armyone of our first families but reverses of fortune you know intimate friends of the laurences sweet creature i assure you my ned is quite wild about her  dear me said the old lady putting up her glass for another observation of meg who tried to look as if she had not heard and been rather shocked at mrs moffats fibs the queer feeling did not pass away but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so got on pretty well though the tight dress gave her a sideache the train kept getting under her feet and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken she was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused for just opposite she saw laurie he was staring at her with undisguised surprise and disapproval also she thought for though he bowed and smiled yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on to complete her confusion she saw belle nudge annie and both glance from her to laurie who she was happy to see looked unusually boyish and shy  silly creatures to put such thoughts into my head i wont care for it or let it change me a bit thought meg and rustled across the room to shake hands with her friend  im glad you came i was afraid you wouldnt she said with her most grownup air  jo wanted me to come and tell her how you looked so i did answered laurie without turning his eyes upon her though he half smiled at her maternal tone  what shall you tell her asked meg full of curiosity to know his opinion of her yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time  i shall say i didnt know you for you look so grownup and unlike yourself im quite afraid of you he said fumbling at his glove button  how absurd of you the girls dressed me up for fun and i rather like it wouldnt jo stare if she saw me said meg bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not  yes i think she would returned laurie gravely  dont you like me so asked meg  no i dont was the blunt reply  why not in an anxious tone  he glanced at her frizzled head bare shoulders and fantastically trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer which had not a particle of his usual politeness in it  i dont like fuss and feathers  that was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself and meg walked away saying petulantly you are the rudest boy i ever saw  feeling very much ruffled she went and stood at a quiet window to cool her cheeks for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant color as she stood there major lincoln passed by and a minute after she heard him saying to his mother  they are making a fool of that little girl i wanted you to see her but they have spoiled her entirely shes nothing but a doll tonight  oh dear sighed meg i wish id been sensible and worn my own things then i should not have disgusted other people or felt so uncomfortable and ashamed of myself  she leaned her forehead on the cool pane and stood half hidden by the curtains never minding that her favorite waltz had begun till some one touched her and turning she saw laurie looking penitent as he said with his very best bow and his hand out  please forgive my rudeness and come and dance with me  im afraid it will be too disagreeable to you said meg trying to look offended and failing entirely  not a bit of it im dying to do it come ill be good i dont like your gown but i do think you are just splendid and he waved his hands as if words failed to express his admiration  meg smiled and relented and whispered as they stood waiting to catch the time take care my skirt doesnt trip you up its the plague of my life and i was a goose to wear it  pin it round your neck and then it will be useful said laurie looking down at the little blue boots which he evidently approved of  away they went fleetly and gracefully for having practiced at home they were well matched and the blithe young couple were a pleasant sight to see as they twirled merrily round and round feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff  laurie i want you to do me a favor will you said meg as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out which it did very soon though she would not own why  wont i said laurie with alacrity  please dont tell them at home about my dress tonight they wont understand the joke and it will worry mother  then why did you do it said lauries eyes so plainly that meg hastily added  i shall tell them myself all about it and fess to mother how silly ive been but id rather do it myself so youll not tell will you  i give you my word i wont only what shall i say when they ask me  just say i looked pretty well and was having a good time  ill say the first with all my heart but how about the other you dont look as if you were having a good time are you and laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper  no not just now dont think im horrid i only wanted a little fun but this sort doesnt pay i find and im getting tired of it  here comes ned moffat what does he want said laurie knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party  he put his name down for three dances and i suppose hes coming for them what a bore said meg assuming a languid air which amused laurie immensely  he did not speak to her again till suppertime when he saw her drinking champagne with ned and his friend fisher who were behaving like a pair of fools as laurie said to himself for he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the marches and fight their battles whenever a defender was needed  youll have a splitting headache tomorrow if you drink much of that i wouldnt meg your mother doesnt like it you know he whispered leaning over her chair as ned turned to refill her glass and fisher stooped to pick up her fan  im not meg tonight im a doll who does all sorts of crazy things tomorrow i shall put away my fuss and feathers and be desperately good again she answered with an affected little laugh  wish tomorrow was here then muttered laurie walking off illpleased at the change he saw in her  meg danced and flirted chattered and giggled as the other girls did after supper she undertook the german and blundered through it nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt and romping in a way that scandalized laurie who looked on and meditated a lecture but he got no chance to deliver it for meg kept away from him till he came to say good night  remember she said trying to smile for the splitting headache had already begun  silence a la mort replied laurie with a melodramatic flourish as he went away  this little bit of byplay excited annies curiosity but meg was too tired for gossip and went to bed feeling as if she had been to a masquerade and hadnt enjoyed herself as much as she expected she was sick all the next day and on saturday went home quite used up with her fortnights fun and feeling that she had sat in the lap of luxury long enough  it does seem pleasant to be quiet and not have company manners on all the time home is a nice place though it isnt splendid said meg looking about her with a restful expression as she sat with her mother and jo on the sunday evening  im glad to hear you say so dear for i was afraid home would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters replied her mother who had given her many anxious looks that day for motherly eyes are quick to see any change in childrens faces  meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a charming time she had had but something still seemed to weigh upon her spirits and when the younger girls were gone to bed she sat thoughtfully staring at the fire saying little and looking worried as the clock struck nine and jo proposed bed meg suddenly left her chair and taking beths stool leaned her elbows on her mothers knee saying bravely  marmee i want to fess  i thought so what is it dear  shall i go away asked jo discreetly  of course not dont i always tell you everything i was ashamed to speak of it before the younger children but i want you to know all the dreadful things i did at the moffats  we are prepared said mrs march smiling but looking a little anxious  i told you they dressed me up but i didnt tell you that they powdered and squeezed and frizzled and made me look like a fashionplate laurie thought i wasnt proper i know he did though he didnt say so and one man called me a doll i knew it was silly but they flattered me and said i was a beauty and quantities of nonsense so i let them make a fool of me  is that all asked jo as mrs march looked silently at the downcast face of her pretty daughter and could not find it in her heart to blame her little follies  no i drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt and was altogether abominable said meg selfreproachfully  there is something more i think and mrs march smoothed the soft cheek which suddenly grew rosy as meg answered slowly  yes its very silly but i want to tell it because i hate to have people say and think such things about us and laurie  then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the moffats and as she spoke jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into megs innocent mind  well if that isnt the greatest rubbish i ever heard cried jo indignantly why didnt you pop out and tell them so on the spot  i couldnt it was so embarrassing for me i couldnt help hearing at first and then i was so angry and ashamed i didnt remember that i ought to go away  just wait till i see annie moffat and ill show you how to settle such ridiculous stuff the idea of having plans and being kind to laurie because hes rich and may marry us byandby wont he shout when i tell him what those silly things say about us poor children and jo laughed as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good joke  if you tell laurie ill never forgive you she mustnt must she mother said meg looking distressed  no never repeat that foolish gossip and forget it as soon as you can said mrs march gravely i was very unwise to let you go among people of whom i know so little kind i dare say but worldly illbred and full of these vulgar ideas about young people i am more sorry than i can express for the mischief this visit may have done you meg  dont be sorry i wont let it hurt me ill forget all the bad and remember only the good for i did enjoy a great deal and thank you very much for letting me go ill not be sentimental or dissatisfied mother i know im a silly little girl and ill stay with you till im fit to take care of myself but it is nice to be praised and admired and i cant help saying i like it said meg looking half ashamed of the confession  that is perfectly natural and quite harmless if the liking does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things learn to know and value the praise which is worth having and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty meg  margaret sat thinking a moment while jo stood with her hands behind her looking both interested and a little perplexed for it was a new thing to see meg blushing and talking about admiration lovers and things of that sort and jo felt as if during that fortnight her sister had grown up amazingly and was drifting away from her into a world where she could not follow  mother do you have plans as mrs moffat said asked meg bashfully  yes my dear i have a great many all mothers do but mine differ somewhat from mrs moffats i suspect i will tell you some of them for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and heart of yours right on a very serious subject you are young meg but not too young to understand me and mothers lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like you jo your turn will come in time perhaps so listen to my plans and help me carry them out if they are good  jo went and sat on one arm of the chair looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair holding a hand of each and watching the two young faces wistfully mrs march said in her serious yet cheery way  i want my daughters to be beautiful accomplished and good to be admired loved and respected to have a happy youth to be well and wisely married and to lead useful pleasant lives with as little care and sorrow to try them as god sees fit to send to be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman and i sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience it is natural to think of it meg right to hope and wait for it and wise to prepare for it so that when the happy time comes you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy my dear girls i am ambitious for you but not to have you make a dash in the world marry rich men merely because they are rich or have splendid houses which are not homes because love is wanting money is a needful and precious thing and when well used a noble thing but i never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for id rather see you poor mens wives if you were happy beloved contented than queens on thrones without selfrespect and peace  poor girls dont stand any chance belle says unless they put themselves forward sighed meg  then well be old maids said jo stoutly  right jo better be happy old maids than unhappy wives or unmaidenly girls running about to find husbands said mrs march decidedly dont be troubled meg poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover some of the best and most honored women i know were poor girls but so loveworthy that they were not allowed to be old maids leave these things to time make this home happy so that you may be fit for homes of your own if they are offered you and contented here if they are not one thing remember my girls mother is always ready to be your confidant father to be your friend and both of us hope and trust that our daughters whether married or single will be the pride and comfort of our lives  we will marmee we will cried both with all their hearts as she bade them good night     chapter ten the pc and po   as spring came on a new set of amusements became the fashion and the lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts the garden had to be put in order and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she liked with hannah used to say id know which each of them gardings belonged to ef i see em in chiny and so she might for the girls tastes differed as much as their characters megs had roses and heliotrope myrtle and a little orange tree in it jos bed was never alike two seasons for she was always trying experiments this year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers the seeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed aunt cockletop and her family of chicks beth had oldfashioned fragrant flowers in her garden sweet peas and mignonette larkspur pinks pansies and southernwood with chickweed for the birds and catnip for the pussies amy had a bower in hers rather small and earwiggy but very pretty to look at with honeysuckle and morningglories hanging their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it tall white lilies delicate ferns and as many brilliant picturesque plants as would consent to blossom there  gardening walks rows on the river and flower hunts employed the fine days and for rainy ones they had house diversions some old some new all more or less original one of these was the pc for as secret societies were the fashion it was thought proper to have one and as all of the girls admired dickens they called themselves the pickwick club with a few interruptions they had kept this up for a year and met every saturday evening in the big garret on which occasions the ceremonies were as follows  three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a lamp also four white badges with a big pc in different colors on each and the weekly newspaper called the pickwick portfolio to which all contributed something while jo who reveled in pens and ink was the editor at seven oclock the four members ascended to the clubroom tied their badges round their heads and took their seats with great solemnity meg as the eldest was samuel pickwick jo being of a literary turn augustus snodgrass beth because she was round and rosy tracy tupman and amy who was always trying to do what she couldnt was nathaniel winkle pickwick the president read the paper which was filled with original tales poetry local news funny advertisements and hints in which they goodnaturedly reminded each other of their faults and short comings on one occasion mr pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glass rapped upon the table hemmed and having stared hard at mr snodgrass who was tilting back in his chair till he arranged himself properly began to read    the pickwick portfolio   may 20 18   poets corner   anniversary ode   again we

throng that filled the stately halls of count adelon knights and ladies elves and pages monks and flower girls all mingled gaily in the dance sweet voices and rich melody filled the air and so with mirth and music the masquerade went on has your highness seen the lady viola tonight asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm  yes is she not lovely though so sad  her dress is well chosen too for in a week she weds count antonio whom she passionately hates  by my faith i envy him yonder he comes arrayed like a bridegroom except the black mask when that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win though her stern father bestows her hand returned the troubadour  tis whispered that she loves the young english artist who haunts her steps and is spurned by the old count said the lady as they joined the dance the revel was at its height when a priest appeared and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove hung with purple velvet he motioned them to kneel instant silence fell on the gay throng and not a sound but the dash of fountains or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight broke the hush as count de adelon spoke thus   my lords and ladies pardon the ruse by which i have gathered you here to witness the marriage of my daughter father we wait your services all eyes turned toward the bridal party and a murmur of amazement went through the throng for neither bride nor groom removed their masks curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over then the eager spectators gathered round the count demanding an explanation  gladly would i give it if i could but i only know that it was the whim of my timid viola and i yielded to it  now my children let the play end unmask and receive my blessing  but neither bent the knee for the young bridegroom replied in a tone that startled all listeners as the mask fell disclosing the noble face of ferdinand devereux the artist lover and leaning on the breast where now flashed the star of an english earl was the lovely viola radiant with joy and beauty  my lord you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when i could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the count antonio i can do more for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the earl of devereux and de vere when he gives his ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady now my wife  the count stood like one changed to stone and turning to the bewildered crowd ferdinand added with a gay smile of triumph to you my gallant friends i can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has done and that you may all win as fair a bride as i have by this masked marriage  s pickwick   why is the p

bore many squashes one day in october when they were ripe he picked one and took it to market a grocerman bought and put it in his shop that same morning a little girl in a brown hat and blue dress with a round face and snub nose went and bought it for her mother she lugged it home cut it up and boiled it in the big pot mashed some of it with salt and butter for dinner and to the rest she added

pickwick sir      i address you upon the subject of sin the sinner i mean is a man     named winkle who makes trouble in his club by laughing and     sometimes wont write his piece in this fine paper i hope you will     pardon his badness and let him send a french fable because he cant     write out of his head as he has so many lessons to do and no brains     in future i will try to take time by the fetlock and prepare some     work which will be all commy la fo that means all right i am in     haste as it is nearly school time   yours respectably n winkle   [the above is a manly and handsome acknowledgment of past misdemeanors if our young friend studied punctuation it would be well]   a sad accident   on friday last we were startled by a violent shock in our basement followed by cries of distress on rushing in a body to the cellar we discovered our beloved president prostrate upon the floor having tripped and fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes a perfect scene of ruin met our eyes for in his fall mr pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form and torn his garments badly on being removed from this perilous situation it was discovered that he had suffered no injury but several bruises and we are happy to add is now doing well   ed   the public bereavement   it is our painful duty to record the sudden and mysterious disappearance of our cherished friend mrs snowball pat paw this lovely and beloved cat was the pet of a large circle of warm and admiring friends for her beauty attracted all eyes her graces and virtues endeared her to all hearts and her loss is deeply felt by the whole community     when last seen she was sitting at the gate watching the butchers     cart and it is feared that some villain tempted by her charms     basely stole her weeks have passed but no trace of her has been     discovered and we relinquish all hope tie a black ribbon to her     basket set aside her dish and weep for her as one lost to us     forever   a sympathizing friend sends the following gem   a lament for s b pat paw   we mourn the loss of our little pet     and sigh oer her hapless fate for never more by the fire shell sit     nor play by the old green gate  the little grave where her infant sleeps     is neath the chestnut tree but oer her grave we may not weep     we know not where it may be  her empty bed her idle ball     will never see her more no gentle tap no loving purr     is heard at the parlor door  another cat comes after her mice     a cat with a dirty face but she does not hunt as our darling did     nor play with her airy grace  her stealthy paws tread the very hall     where snowball used to play but she only spits at the dogs our pet     so gallantly drove away  she is useful and mild and does her best     but she is not fair to see and we cannot give her your place dear     nor worship her as we worship thee   as   advertisements   miss oranthy bluggage the

please dont forget amys napkin nw must not fret because his dress has not nine tucks   weekly report   meggood jobad bethvery good amymiddling   as the president finished reading the paper which i beg leave to assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written by bona fide girls once upon a time a round of applause followed and then mr snodgrass rose to make a proposition  mr president and gentlemen he began assuming a parliamentary attitude and tone i wish to propose the admission of a new memberone who highly deserves the honor would be deeply grateful for it and would add immensely to the spirit of the club the literary value of the paper and be no end jolly and nice i propose mr theodore laurence as an honorary member of the p c come now do have him  jos sudden change of tone made the girls laugh but all looked rather anxious and no one said a word as snodgrass took his seat  well put it to a vote said the president all in favor of this motion please to manifest it by saying aye  a loud response from snodgrass followed to everybodys surprise by a timid one from beth  contraryminded say no  meg and amy were contraryminded and mr winkle rose to say with great elegance we dont wish any boys they only joke and bounce about this is a ladies club and we wish to be private and proper  im afraid hell laugh at our paper and make fun of us afterward observed pickwick pulling the little curl on her forehead as she always did when doubtful  up rose snodgrass very much in earnest sir i give you my word as a gentleman laurie wont do anything of the sort he likes to write and hell give a tone to our contributions and keep us from being sentimental dont you see we can do so little for him and he does so much for us i think the least we can do is to offer him a place here and make him welcome if he comes  this artful allusion to benefits conferred brought tupman to his feet looking as if he had quite made up his mind  yes we ought to do it even if we are afraid i say he may come and his grandpa too if he likes  this spirited burst from beth electrified the club and jo left her seat to shake hands approvingly now then vote again everybody remember its our laurie and say aye cried snodgrass excitedly  aye aye aye replied three voices at once  good bless you now as theres nothing like taking time by the fetlock as winkle characteristically observes allow me to present the new member and to the dismay of the rest of the club jo threw open the door of the closet and displayed laurie sitting on a rag bag flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter  you rogue you traitor jo how could you cried the three girls as snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth and producing both a chair and a badge installed him in a jiffy  the coolness of you two rascals is amazing began mr pickwick trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an amiable smile but the new member was equal to the occasion and rising with a grateful salutation to the chair said in the most engaging manner mr president and ladiesi beg pardon gentlemenallow me to introduce myself as sam weller the very humble servant of the club  good good cried jo pounding with the handle of the old warming pan on which she leaned  my faithful friend and noble patron continued laurie with a wave of the hand who has so flatteringly presented me is not to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight i planned it and she only gave in after lots of teasing  come now dont lay it all on yourself you know i proposed the cupboard broke in snodgrass who was enjoying the joke amazingly  never mind what she says im the wretch that did it sir said the new member with a welleresque nod to mr pickwick but on my honor i never will do so again and henceforth devote myself to the interest of this immortal club  hear hear cried jo clashing the lid of the warming pan like a cymbal  go on go on added winkle and tupman while the president bowed benignly  i merely wish to say that as a slight token of my gratitude for the honor done me and as a means of promoting friendly relations between adjoining nations i have set up a post office in the hedge in the lower corner of the garden a fine spacious building with padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mails also the females if i may be allowed the expression its the old martin house but ive stopped up the door and made the roof open so it will hold all sorts of things and save our valuable time letters manuscripts books and bundles can be passed in there and as each nation has a key it will be uncommonly nice i fancy allow me to present the club key and with many thanks for your favor take my seat  great applause as mr weller deposited a little key on the table and subsided the warming pan clashed and waved wildly and it was some time before order could be restored a long discussion followed and everyone came out surprising for everyone did her best so it was an unusually lively meeting and did not adjourn till a late hour when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member  no one ever regretted the admittance of sam weller for a more devoted wellbehaved and jovial member no club could have he certainly did add spirit to the meetings and a tone to the paper for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent being patriotic classical comical or dramatic but never sentimental jo regarded them as worthy of bacon milton or shakespeare and remodeled her own works with good effect she thought  the p o was a capital little institution and flourished wonderfully for nearly as many queer things passed through it as through the real post office tragedies and cravats poetry and pickles garden seeds and long letters music and gingerbread rubbers invitations scoldings and puppies the old gentleman liked the fun and amused himself by sending odd bundles mysterious messages and funny telegrams and his gardener who was smitten with hannahs charms actually sent a love letter to jos care how they laughed when the secret came out never dreaming how many love letters that little post office would hold in the years to come     chapter eleven experiments   the first of june the kings are off to the seashore tomorrow and im free three months vacationhow i shall enjoy it exclaimed meg coming home one warm day to find jo laid upon the sofa in an unusual state of exhaustion while beth took off her dusty boots and amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party  aunt march went today for which oh be joyful said jo i was mortally afraid shed ask me to go with her if she had i should have felt as if i ought to do it but plumfield is about as gay as a churchyard you know and id rather be excused we had a flurry getting the old lady off and i had a fright every time she spoke to me for i was in such a hurry to be through that i was uncommonly helpful and sweet and feared shed find it impossible to part from me i quaked till she was fairly in the carriage and had a final fright for as it drove of she popped out her head saying josyphine wont you i didnt hear any more for i basely turned and fled i did actually run and whisked round the corner where i felt safe  poor old jo she came in looking as if bears were after her said beth as she cuddled her sisters feet with a motherly air  aunt march is a regular samphire is she not observed amy tasting her mixture critically  she means vampire not seaweed but it doesnt matter its too warm to be particular about ones parts of speech murmured jo  what shall you do all your vacation asked amy changing the subject with tact  i shall lie abed late and do nothing replied meg from the depths of the rocking chair ive been routed up early all winter and had to spend my days working for other people so now im going to rest and revel to my hearts content  no said jo that dozy way wouldnt suit me ive laid in a heap of books and im going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in the old apple tree when im not having l  dont say larks implored amy as a return snub for the samphire correction  ill say nightingales then with laurie thats proper and appropriate since hes a warbler  dont let us do any lessons beth for a while but play all the time and rest as the girls mean to proposed amy  well i will if mother doesnt mind i want to learn some new songs and my children need fitting up for the summer they are dreadfully out of order and really suffering for clothes  may we mother asked meg turning to mrs march who sat sewing in what they called marmees corner  you may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it i think by saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as bad as all work and no play  oh dear no it will be delicious im sure said meg complacently  i now propose a toast as my friend and pardner sairy gamp says fun forever and no grubbing cried jo rising glass in hand as the lemonade went round  they all drank it merrily and began the experiment by lounging for the rest of the day next morning meg did not appear till ten oclock her solitary breakfast did not taste good and the room seemed lonely and untidy for jo had not filled the vases beth had not dusted and amys books lay scattered about nothing was neat and pleasant but marmees corner which looked as usual and there meg sat to rest and read which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get with her salary jo spent the morning on the river with laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over the wide wide world up in the apple tree beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet where her family resided but getting tired before half done she left her establishment topsyturvy and went to her music rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash amy arranged her bower put on her best white frock smoothed her curls and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle hoping someone would see and inquire who the young artist was as no one appeared but an inquisitive daddylonglegs who examined her work with interest she went to walk got caught in a shower and came home dripping  at teatime they compared notes and all agreed that it had been a delightful though unusually long day meg who went shopping in the afternoon and got a sweet blue muslin had discovered after she had cut the breadths off that it wouldnt wash which mishap made her slightly cross jo had burned the skin off her nose boating and got a raging headache by reading too long beth was worried by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at once and amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock for katy browns party was to be the next day and now like flora mcflimsey she had nothing to wear but these were mere trifles and they assured their mother that the experiment was working finely she smiled said nothing and with hannahs help did their neglected work keeping home pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly it was astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the resting and reveling process the days kept getting longer and longer the weather was unusually variable and so were tempers an unsettled feeling possessed everyone and satan found plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do as the height of luxury meg put out some of her sewing and then found time hang so heavily that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to furbish them up a la moffat jo read till her eyes gave out and she was sick of books got so fidgety that even goodnatured laurie had a quarrel with her and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished she had gone with aunt march beth got on pretty well for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work and fell back into her old ways now and then but something in the air affected her and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear joanna and told her she was a fright amy fared worst of all for her resources were small and when her sisters left her to amuse herself she soon found that accomplished and important little self a great burden she didnt like dolls fairy tales were childish and one couldnt draw all the time tea parties didnt amount to much neither did picnics unless very well conducted if one could have a fine house full of nice girls or go traveling the summer would be delightful but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a grownup boy was enough to try the patience of a boaz complained miss malaprop after several days devoted to pleasure fretting and ennui  no one would own that they were tired of the experiment but by friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was nearly done hoping to impress the lesson more deeply mrs march who had a good deal of humor resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner so she gave hannah a holiday and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system  when they got up on saturday morning there was no fire in the kitchen no breakfast in the dining room and no mother anywhere to be seen  mercy on us what has happened cried jo staring about her in dismay  meg ran upstairs and soon came back again looking relieved but rather bewildered and a little ashamed  mother isnt sick only very tired and she says she is going to stay quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can its a very queer thing for her to do she doesnt act a bit like herself but she says it has been a hard week for her so we mustnt grumble but take care of ourselves  thats easy enough and i like the idea im aching for something to do that is some new amusement you know added jo quickly  in fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work and they took hold with a will but soon realized the truth of hannahs saying housekeeping aint no joke there was plenty of food in the larder and while beth and amy set the table meg and jo got breakfast wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work  i shall take some up to mother though she said we were not to think of her for shed take care of herself said meg who presided and felt quite matronly behind the teapot  so a tray was fitted out before anyone began and taken up with the cooks compliments the boiled tea was very bitter the omelet scorched and the biscuits speckled with saleratus but mrs march received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after jo was gone  poor little souls they will have a hard time im afraid but they wont suffer and it will do them good she said producing the more palatable viands with which she had provided herself and disposing of the bad breakfast so that their feelings might not be hurt a motherly little deception for which they were grateful  many were the complaints below and great the chagrin of the head cook at her failures never mind ill get the dinner and be servant you be mistress keep your hands nice see company and give orders said jo who knew still less than meg about culinary affairs  this obliging offer was gladly accepted and margaret retired to the parlor which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting jo with perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the quarrel immediately put a note in the office inviting laurie to dinner  youd better see what you have got before you think of having company said meg when informed of the hospitable but rash act  oh theres corned beef and plenty of potatoes and i shall get some asparagus and a lobster for a relish as hannah says well have lettuce and make a salad i dont know how but the book tells ill have blanc mange and strawberries for dessert and coffee too if you want to be elegant  dont try too many messes jo for you cant make anything but gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat i wash my hands of the dinner party and since you have asked laurie on your own responsibility you may just take care of him  i dont want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the pudding youll give me your advice if i get in a muddle wont you asked jo rather hurt  yes but i dont know much except about bread and a few trifles you had better ask mothers leave before you order anything returned meg prudently  of course i shall im not a fool and jo went off in a huff at the doubts expressed of her powers  get what you like and dont disturb me im going out to dinner and cant worry about things at home said mrs march when jo spoke to her i never enjoyed housekeeping and im going to take a vacation today and read write go visiting and amuse myself  the unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and reading early in the morning made jo feel as if some unnatural phenomenon had occurred for an eclipse an earthquake or a volcanic eruption would hardly have seemed stranger  everything is out of sorts somehow she said to herself going downstairs theres beth crying thats a sure sign that something is wrong in this family if amy is bothering ill shake her  feeling very much out of sorts herself jo hurried into the parlor to find beth sobbing over pip the canary who lay dead in the cage with his little claws pathetically extended as if imploring the food for want of which he had died  its all my fault i forgot him there isnt a seed or a drop left oh pip oh pip how could i be so cruel to you cried beth taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him  jo peeped into his halfopen eye felt his little heart and finding him stiff and cold shook her head and offered her domino box for a coffin  put him in the oven and maybe he will get warm and revive said amy hopefully  hes been starved and he shant be baked now hes dead ill make him a shroud and he shall be buried in the garden and ill never have another bird never my pip for i am too bad to own one murmured beth sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands  the funeral shall be this afternoon and we will all go now dont cry bethy its a pity but nothing goes right this week and pip has had the worst of the experiment make the shroud and lay him in my box and after the dinner party well have a nice little funeral said jo beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal  leaving the others to console beth she departed to the kitchen which was in a most discouraging state of confusion putting on a big apron she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing when she discovered that the fire was out  heres a sweet prospect muttered jo slamming the stove door open and poking vigorously among the cinders  having rekindled the fire she thought she would go to market while the water heated the walk revived her spirits and flattering herself that she had made good bargains she trudged home again after buying a very young lobster some very old asparagus and two boxes of acid strawberries by the time she got cleared up the dinner arrived and the stove was redhot hannah had left a pan of bread to rise meg had worked it up early set it on the hearth for a second rising and forgotten it meg was entertaining sallie gardiner in the parlor when the door flew open and a floury crocky flushed and disheveled figure appeared demanding tartly  i say isnt bread riz enough when it runs over the pans  sallie began to laugh but meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high as they would go which caused the apparition to vanish and put the sour bread into the oven without further delay mrs march went out after peeping here and there to see how matters went also saying a word of comfort to beth who sat making a winding sheet while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box a strange sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner and despair seized them when a few minutes later miss crocker appeared and said shed come to dinner now this lady was a thin yellow spinster with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes who saw everything and gossiped about all she saw they disliked her but had been taught to be kind to her simply because she was old and poor and had few friends so meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain her while she asked questions criticized everything and told stories of the people whom she knew  language cannot describe the anxieties experiences and exertions which jo underwent that morning and the dinner she served up became a standing joke fearing to ask any more advice she did her best alone and discovered that something more than energy and good will is necessary to make a cook she boiled the asparagus for an hour and was grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever the bread burned black for the salad dressing so aggravated her that she could not make it fit to eat the lobster was a scarlet mystery to her but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves the potatoes had to be hurried not to keep the asparagus waiting and were not done at the last the blanc mange was lumpy and the strawberries not as ripe as they looked having been skilfully deaconed  well they can eat beef and bread and butter if they are hungry only its mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing thought jo as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual and stood hot tired and dispirited surveying the feast spread before laurie accustomed to all sorts of elegance and miss crocker whose tattling tongue would report them far and wide  poor jo would gladly have gone under the table as one thing after another was tasted and left while amy giggled meg looked distressed miss crocker pursed her lips and laurie talked and laughed with all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene jos one strong point was the fruit for she had sugared it well and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it her hot cheeks cooled a trifle and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round and everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream miss crocker tasted first made a wry face and drank some water hastily jo who refused thinking there might not be enough for they dwindled sadly after the picking over glanced at laurie but he was eating away manfully though there was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate amy who was fond of delicate fare took a heaping spoonful choked hid her face in her napkin and left the table precipitately  oh what is it exclaimed jo trembling  salt instead of sugar and the cream is sour replied meg with a tragic gesture  jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair remembering that she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes on the kitchen table and had neglected to put the milk in the refrigerator she turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying when she met lauries eyes which would look merry in spite of his heroic efforts the comical side of the affair suddenly struck her and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks so did everyone else even croaker as the girls called the old lady and the unfortunate dinner ended gaily with bread and butter olives and fun  i havent strength of mind enough to clear up now so we will sober ourselves with a funeral said jo as they rose and miss crocker made ready to go being eager to tell the new story at another friends dinner table  they did sober themselves for beths sake laurie dug a grave under the ferns in the grove little pip was laid in with many tears by his tenderhearted mistress and covered with moss while a wreath of violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph composed by jo while she struggled with the dinner  here lies pip march who died the 7th of june loved and lamented sore and not forgotten soon   at the conclusion of the ceremonies beth retired to her room overcome with emotion and lobster but there was no place of repose for the beds were not made and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up the pillows and putting things in order meg helped jo clear away the remains of the feast which took half the afternoon and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper  laurie took amy to drive which was a deed of charity for the sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper mrs march came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the afternoon and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of one part of the experiment  before the housewives could rest several people called and there was a scramble to get ready to see them then tea must be got errands done and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last minute as twilight fell dewy and still one by one they gathered on the porch where the june roses were budding beautifully and each groaned or sighed as she sat down as if tired or troubled  what a dreadful day this has been began jo usually the first to speak  it has seemed shorter than usual but so uncomfortable said meg  not a bit like home added amy  it cant seem so without marmee and little pip sighed beth glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head  heres mother dear and you shall have another bird tomorrow if you want it  as she spoke mrs march came and took her place among them looking as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs  are you satisfied with your experiment girls or do you want another week of it she asked as beth nestled up to her and the rest turned toward her with brightening faces as flowers turn toward the sun  i dont cried jo decidedly  nor i echoed the others  you think then that it is better to have a few duties and live a little for others do you  lounging and larking doesnt pay observed jo shaking her head im tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off  suppose you learn plain cooking thats a useful accomplishment which no woman should be without said mrs march laughing inaudibly at the recollection of jos dinner party for she had met miss crocker and heard her account of it  mother did you go away and let everything be just to see how wed get on cried meg who had had suspicions all day  yes i wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully while hannah and i did your work you got on pretty well though i dont think you were very happy or amiable so i thought as a little lesson i would show you what happens when everyone thinks only of herself dont you feel that it is pleasanter to help one another to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it comes and to bear and forbear that home may be comfortable and lovely to us all  we do mother we do cried the girls  then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again for though they seem heavy sometimes they are good for us and lighten as we learn to carry them work is wholesome and there is plenty for everyone it keeps us from ennui and mischief is good for health and spirits and gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or fashion  well work like bees and love it too see if we dont said jo ill learn plain cooking for my holiday task and the next dinner party i have shall be a success  ill make the set of shirts for father instead of letting you do it marmee i can and i will though im not fond of sewing that will be better than fussing over my own things which are plenty nice enough as they are said meg  ill do my lessons every day and not spend so much time with my music and dolls i am a stupid thing and ought to be studying not playing was beths resolution while amy followed their example by heroically declaring i shall learn to make buttonholes and attend to my parts of speech  very good then i am quite satisfied with the experiment and fancy that we shall not have to repeat it only dont go to the other extreme and delve like slaves have regular hours for work and play make each day both useful and pleasant and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well then youth will be delightful old age will bring few regrets and life become a beautiful success in spite of poverty  well remember mother and they did     chapter twelve camp laurence   beth was postmistress for being most at home she could attend to it regularly and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door and distributing the mail one july day she came in with her hands full and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the penny post  heres your posy mother laurie never forgets that she said putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in marmees corner and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy  miss meg march one letter and a glove continued beth delivering the articles to her sister who sat near her mother stitching wristbands  why i left a pair over there and here is only one said meg looking at the gray cotton glove didnt you drop the other in the garden  no im sure i didnt for there was only one in the office  i hate to have odd gloves never mind the other may be found my letter is only a translation of the german song i wanted i think mr brooke did it for this isnt lauries writing  mrs march glanced at meg who was looking very pretty in her gingham morning gown with the little curls blowing about her forehead and very womanly as she sat sewing at her little worktable full of tidy white rolls so unconscious of the thought in her mothers mind as she sewed and sang while her fingers flew and her thoughts were busied with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt that mrs march smiled and was satisfied  two letters for doctor jo a book and a funny old hat which covered the whole post office and stuck outside said beth laughing as she went into the study where jo sat writing  what a sly fellow laurie is i said i wished bigger hats were the fashion because i burn my face every hot day he said why mind the fashion wear a big hat and be comfortable i said i would if i had one and he has sent me this to try me ill wear it for fun and show him i dont care for the fashion and hanging the antique broadbrim on a bust of plato jo read her letters  one from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill for it said to her  my dear    i write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction i watch your efforts to control your temper you say nothing about your trials failures or successes and think perhaps that no one sees them but the friend whose help you daily ask if i may trust the wellworn cover of your guidebook i too have seen them all and heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution since it begins to bear fruit go on dear patiently and bravely and always believe that no one sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving   mother   that does me good thats worth millions of money and pecks of praise oh marmee i do try i will keep on trying and not get tired since i have you to help me  laying her head on her arms jo wet her little romance with a few happy tears for she had thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts to be good and this assurance was doubly precious doubly encouraging because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most valued feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her apollyon she pinned the note inside her frock as a shield and a reminder lest she be taken unaware and proceeded to open her other letter quite ready for either good or bad news in a big dashing hand laurie wrote  dear jo what ho   some english girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and i want to have a jolly time if its fine im going to pitch my tent in longmeadow and row up the whole crew to lunch and croquethave a fire make messes gypsy fashion and all sorts of larks they are nice people and like such things brooke will go to keep us boys steady and kate vaughn will play propriety for the girls i want you all to come cant let beth off at any price and nobody shall worry her dont bother about rations ill see to that and everything else only do come theres a good fellow   in a tearing hurry yours ever laurie   heres richness cried jo flying in to tell the news to meg  of course we can go mother it will be such a help to laurie for i can row and meg see to the lunch and the children be useful in some way  i hope the vaughns are not fine grownup people do you know anything about them jo asked meg  only that there are four of them kate is older than you fred and frank twins about my age and a little girl grace who is nine or ten laurie knew them abroad and liked the boys i fancied from the way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her that he didnt admire kate much  im so glad my french print is clean its just the thing and so becoming observed meg complacently have you anything decent jo  scarlet and gray boating suit good enough for me i shall row and tramp about so i dont want any starch to think of youll come betty  if you wont let any boys talk to me  not a boy  i like to please laurie and im not afraid of mr brooke he is so kind but i dont want to play or sing or say anything ill work hard and not trouble anyone and youll take care of me jo so ill go  thats my good girl you do try to fight off your shyness and i love you for it fighting faults isnt easy as i know and a cheery word kind of gives a lift thank you mother and jo gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss more precious to mrs march than if it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth  i had a box of chocolate drops and the picture i wanted to copy said amy showing her mail  and i got a note from mr laurence asking me to come over and play to him tonight before the lamps are lighted and i shall go added beth whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely  now lets fly round and do double duty today so that we can play tomorrow with free minds said jo preparing to replace her pen with a broom  when the sun peeped into the girls room early next morning to promise them a fine day he saw a comical sight each had made such preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper meg had an extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead jo had copiously anointed her afflicted face with cold cream beth had taken joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching separation and amy had capped the climax by putting a clothespin on her nose to uplift the offending feature it was one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their drawing boards therefore quite appropriate and effective for the purpose it was now being put this funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun for he burst out with such radiance that jo woke up and roused her sisters by a hearty laugh at amys ornament  sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party and soon a lively bustle began in both houses beth who was ready first kept reporting what went on next door and enlivened her sisters toilets by frequent telegrams from the window  there goes the man with the tent i see mrs barker doing up the lunch in a hamper and a great basket now mr laurence is looking up at the sky and the weathercock i wish he would go too theres laurie looking like a sailor nice boy oh mercy me heres a carriage full of people a tall lady a little girl and two dreadful boys one is lame poor thing hes got a crutch laurie didnt tell us that be quick girls its getting late why there is ned moffat i do declare meg isnt that the man who bowed to you one day when we were shopping  so it is how queer that he should come i thought he was at the mountains there is sallie im glad she got back in time am i all right jo cried meg in a flutter  a regular daisy hold up your dress and put your hat on straight it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff now then come on  oh jo you are not going to wear that awful hat its too absurd you shall not make a guy of yourself remonstrated meg as jo tied down with a red ribbon the broadbrimmed oldfashioned leghorn laurie had sent for a joke  i just will though for its capital so shady light and big it will make fun and i dont mind being a guy if im comfortable with that jo marched straight away and the rest followed a bright little band of sisters all looking their best in summer suits with happy faces under the jaunty hatbrims  laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial manner the lawn was the reception room and for several minutes a lively scene was enacted there meg was grateful to see that miss kate though twenty was dressed with a simplicity which american girls would do well to imitate and who was much flattered by mr neds assurances that he came especially to see her jo understood why laurie primmed up his mouth when speaking of kate for that young lady had a standoffdonttouchme air which contrasted strongly with the free and easy demeanor of the other girls beth took an observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not dreadful but gentle and feeble and she would be kind to him on that account amy found grace a wellmannered merry little person and after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes they suddenly became very good friends  tents lunch and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand the party was soon embarked and the two boats pushed off together leaving mr laurence waving his hat on the shore laurie and jo rowed one boat mr brooke and ned the other while fred vaughn the riotous twin did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed water bug jos funny hat deserved a vote of thanks for it was of general utility it broke the ice in the beginning by producing a laugh it created quite a refreshing breeze flapping to and fro as she rowed and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party if a shower came up she said miss kate decided that she was odd but rather clever and smiled upon her from afar  meg in the other boat was delightfully situated face to face with the rowers who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with uncommon skill and dexterity mr brooke was a grave silent young man with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice meg liked his quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful knowledge he never talked to her much but he looked at her a good deal and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion ned being in college of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it their bounden duty to assume he was not very wise but very goodnatured and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic sallie gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and chattering with the ubiquitous fred who kept beth in constant terror by his pranks  it was not far to longmeadow but the tent was pitched and the wickets down by the time they arrived a pleasant green field with three widespreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf for croquet  welcome to camp laurence said the young host as they landed with exclamations of delight  brooke is commander in chief i am commissary general the other fellows are staff officers and you ladies are company the tent is for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing room this is the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen now lets have a game before it gets hot and then well see about dinner  frank beth amy and grace sat down to watch the game played by the other eight mr brooke chose meg kate and fred laurie took sallie jo and ned the english played well but the americans played better and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of 76 inspired them jo and fred had several skirmishes and once narrowly escaped high words jo was through the last wicket and had missed the stroke which failure ruffled her a good deal fred was close behind her and his turn came before hers he gave a stroke his ball hit the wicket and stopped an inch on the wrong side no one was very near and running up to examine he gave it a sly nudge with his toe which put it just an inch on the right side  im through now miss jo ill settle you and get in first cried the young gentleman swinging his mallet for another blow  you pushed it i saw you its my turn now said jo sharply  upon my word i didnt move it it rolled a bit perhaps but that is allowed so stand off please and let me have a go at the stake  we dont cheat in america but you can if you choose said jo angrily  yankees are a deal the most tricky everybody knows there you go returned fred croqueting her ball far away  jo opened her lips to say something rude but checked herself in time colored up to her forehead and stood a minute hammering down a wicket with all her might while fred hit the stake and declared himself out with much exultation she went off to get her ball and was a long time finding it among the bushes but she came back looking cool and quiet and waited her turn patiently it took several strokes to regain the place she had lost and when she got there the other side had nearly won for kates ball was the last but one and lay near the stake  by george its all up with us goodbye kate miss jo owes me one so you are finished cried fred excitedly as they all drew near to see the finish  yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies said jo with a look that made the lad redden especially when they beat them she added as leaving kates ball untouched she won the game by a clever stroke  laurie threw up his hat then remembered that it wouldnt do to exult over the defeat of his guests and stopped in the middle of the cheer to whisper to his friend good for you jo he did cheat i saw him we cant tell him so but he wont do it again take my word for it  meg drew her aside under pretense of pinning up a loose braid and said approvingly it was dreadfully provoking but you kept your temper and im so glad jo  dont praise me meg for i could box his ears this minute i should certainly have boiled over if i hadnt stayed among the nettles till i got my rage under control enough to hold my tongue its simmering now so i hope hell keep out of my way returned jo biting her lips as she glowered at fred from under her big hat  time for lunch said mr brooke looking at his watch commissary general will you make the fire and get water while miss march miss sallie and i spread the table who can make good coffee  jo can said meg glad to recommend her sister so jo feeling that her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor went to preside over the coffeepot while the children collected dry sticks and the boys made a fire and got water from a spring near by miss kate sketched and frank talked to beth who was making little mats of braided rushes to serve as plates  the commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables prettily decorated with green leaves jo announced that the coffee was ready and everyone settled themselves to a hearty meal for youth is seldom dyspeptic and exercise develops wholesome appetites a very merry lunch it was for everything seemed fresh and funny and frequent peals of laughter startled a venerable horse who fed near by there was a pleasing inequality in the table which produced many mishaps to cups and plates acorns dropped in the milk little black ants partook of the refreshments without being invited and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree to see what was going on three whiteheaded children peeped over the fence and an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river with all his might and main  theres salt here said laurie as he handed jo a saucer of berries  thank you i prefer spiders she replied fishing up two unwary little ones who had gone to a creamy death how dare you remind me of that horrid dinner party when yours is so nice in every way added jo as they both laughed and ate out of one plate the china having run short  i had an uncommonly good time that day and havent got over it yet this is no credit to me you know i dont do anything its you and meg and brooke who make it all go and im no end obliged to you what shall we do when we cant eat anymore asked laurie feeling that his trump card had been played when lunch was over  have games till its cooler i brought authors and i dare say miss kate knows something new and nice go and ask her shes company and you ought to stay with her more  arent you company too i thought shed suit brooke but he keeps talking to meg and kate just stares at them through that ridiculous glass of hers im going so you neednt try to preach propriety for you cant do it jo  miss kate did know several new games and as the girls would not and the boys could not eat any more they all adjourned to the drawing room to play rigmarole  one person begins a story any nonsense you like and tells as long as he pleases only taking care to stop short at some exciting point when the next takes it up and does the same its very funny when well done and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh over please start it mr brooke said kate with a commanding air which surprised meg who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other gentleman  lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies mr brooke obediently began the story with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed upon the sunshiny river  once on a time a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune for he had nothing but his sword and his shield he traveled a long while nearly eightandtwenty years and had a hard time of it till he came to the palace of a good old king who had offered a reward to anyone who could tame and train a fine but unbroken colt of which he was very fond the knight agreed to try and got on slowly but surely for the colt was a gallant fellow and soon learned to love his new master though he was freakish and wild every day when he gave his lessons to this pet of the kings the knight rode him through the city and as he rode he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face which he had seen many times in his dreams but never found one day as he went prancing down a quiet street he saw at the window of a ruinous castle the lovely face he was delighted inquired who lived in this old castle and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by a spell and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty the knight wished intensely that he could free them but he was poor and could only go by each day watching for the sweet face and longing to see it out in the sunshine at last he resolved to get into the castle and ask how he could help them he went and knocked the great door flew open and he beheld  a ravishingly lovely lady who exclaimed with a cry of rapture at last at last continued kate who had read french novels and admired the style tis she cried count gustave and fell at her feet in an ecstasy of joy oh rise she said extending a hand of marble fairness never till you tell me how i may rescue you swore the knight still kneeling alas my cruel fate condemns me to remain here till my tyrant is destroyed where is the villain in the mauve salon go brave heart and save me from despair i obey and return victorious or dead with these thrilling words he rushed away and flinging open the door of the mauve salon was about to enter when he received  a stunning blow from the big greek lexicon which an old fellow in a black gown fired at him said ned instantly sir whatshisname recovered himself pitched the tyrant out of the window and turned to join the lady victorious but with a bump on his brow found the door locked tore up the curtains made a rope ladder got halfway down when the ladder broke and he went headfirst into the moat sixty feet below could swim like a duck paddled round the castle till he came to a little door guarded by two stout fellows knocked their heads together till they cracked like a couple of nuts then by a trifling exertion of his prodigious strength he smashed in the door went up a pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick toads as big as your fist and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics miss march at the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away and chilled his blood  a tall figure all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its wasted hand went on meg it beckoned gliding noiselessly before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb shadowy effigies in armor stood on either side a dead silence reigned the lamp burned blue and the ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face toward him showing the glitter of awful eyes through its white veil they reached a curtained door behind which sounded lovely music he sprang forward to enter but the specter plucked him back and waved threateningly before him a  snuffbox said jo in a sepulchral tone which convulsed the audience thankee said the knight politely as he took a pinch and sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off ha ha laughed the ghost and having peeped through the keyhole at the princesses spinning away for dear life the evil spirit picked up her victim and put him in a large tin box where there were eleven other knights packed together without their heads like sardines who all rose and began to  dance a hornpipe cut in fred as jo paused for breath and as they danced the rubbishy old castle turned to a manofwar in full sail up with the jib reef the topsl halliards helm hard alee and man the guns roared the captain as a portuguese pirate hove in sight with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast go in and win my hearties says the captain and a tremendous fight began of course the british beatthey always do  no they dont cried jo aside  having taken the pirate captain prisoner sailed slap over the schooner whose decks were piled high with dead and whose lee scuppers ran blood for the order had been cutlasses and die hard bosuns mate take a bight of the flyingjib sheet and start this villain if he doesnt confess his sins double quick said the british captain the portuguese held his tongue like a brick and walked the plank while the jolly tars cheered like mad but the sly dog dived came up under the manofwar scuttled her and down she went with all sail set to the bottom of the sea sea sea where  oh gracious what shall i say cried sallie as fred ended his rigmarole in which he had jumbled together pellmell nautical phrases and facts out of one of his favorite books well they went to the bottom and a nice mermaid welcomed them but was much grieved on finding the box of headless knights and kindly pickled them in brine hoping to discover the mystery about them for being a woman she was curious byandby a diver came down and the mermaid said ill give you a box of pearls if you can take it up for she wanted to restore the poor things to life and couldnt raise the heavy load herself so the diver hoisted it up and was much disappointed on opening it to find no pearls he left it in a great lonely field where it was found by a  little goose girl who kept a hundred fat geese in the field said amy when sallies invention gave out the little girl was sorry for them and asked an old woman what she should do to help them your geese will tell you they know everything said the old woman so she asked what she should use for new heads since the old ones were lost and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed  cabbages continued laurie promptly just the thing said the girl and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden she put them on the knights revived at once thanked her and went on their way rejoicing never knowing the difference for there were so many other heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it the knight in whom im interested went back to find the pretty face and learned that the princesses had spun themselves free and all gone and married but one he was in a great state of mind at that and mounting the colt who stood by him through thick and thin rushed to the castle to see which was left peeping over the hedge he saw the queen of his affections picking flowers in her garden will you give me a rose said he you must come and get it i cant come to you it isnt proper said she as sweet as honey he tried to climb over the hedge but it seemed to grow higher and higher then he tried to push through but it grew thicker and thicker and he was in despair so he patiently broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole through which he peeped saying imploringly let me in let me in but the pretty princess did not seem to understand for she picked her roses quietly and left him to fight his way in whether he did or not frank will tell you  i cant im not playing i never do said frank dismayed at the sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd couple beth had disappeared behind jo and grace was asleep  so the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge is he asked mr brooke still watching the river and playing with the wild rose in his buttonhole  i guess the princess gave him a posy and opened the gate after a while said laurie smiling to himself as he threw acorns at his tutor  what a piece of nonsense we have made with practice we might do something quite clever do you know truth  i hope so said meg soberly  the game i mean  what is it said fred  why you pile up your hands choose a number and draw out in turn and the person who draws at the number has to answer truly any question put by the rest its great fun  lets try it said jo who liked new experiments  miss kate and mr brooke meg and ned declined but fred sallie jo and laurie piled and drew and the lot fell to laurie  who are your heroes asked jo  grandfather and napoleon  which lady here do you think prettiest said sallie  margaret  which do you like best from fred  jo of course  what silly questions you ask and jo gave a disdainful shrug as the rest laughed at lauries matteroffact tone  try again truth isnt a bad game said fred  its a very good one for you retorted jo in a low voice her turn came next  what is your greatest fault asked fred by way of testing in her the virtue he lacked himself  a quick temper  what do you most wish for said laurie  a pair of boot lacings returned jo guessing and defeating his purpose  not a true answer you must say what you really do want most  genius dont you wish you could give it to me laurie and she slyly smiled in his disappointed face  what virtues do you most admire in a man asked sallie  courage and honesty  now my turn said fred as his hand came last  lets give it to him whispered laurie to jo who nodded and asked at once  didnt you cheat at croquet  well yes a little bit  good didnt you take your story out of the sea lion said laurie  rather  dont you think the english nation perfect in every respect asked sallie  i should be ashamed of myself if i didnt  hes a true john bull now miss sallie you shall have a chance without waiting to draw ill harrrow up your feelings first by asking if you dont think you are something of a flirt said laurie as jo nodded to fred as a sign that peace was declared  you impertinent boy of course im not exclaimed sallie with an air that proved the contrary  what do you hate most asked fred  spiders and rice pudding  what do you like best asked jo  dancing and french gloves  well i think truth is a very silly play lets have a sensible game of authors to refresh our minds proposed jo  ned frank and the little girls joined in this and while it went on the three elders sat apart talking miss kate took out her sketch again and margaret watched her while mr brooke lay on the grass with a book which he did not read  how beautifully you do it i wish i could draw said meg with mingled admiration and regret in her voice  why dont you learn i should think you had taste and talent for it replied miss kate graciously  i havent time  your mamma prefers other accomplishments i fancy so did mine but i proved to her that i had talent by taking a few lessons privately and then she was quite willing i should go on cant you do the same with your governess  i have none  i forgot young ladies in america go to school more than with us very fine schools they are too papa says you go to a private one i suppose  i dont go at all i am a governess myself  oh indeed said miss kate but she might as well have said dear me how dreadful for her tone implied it and something in her face made meg color and wish she had not been so frank  mr brooke looked up and said quickly young ladies in america love independence as much as their ancestors did and are admired and respected for supporting themselves  oh yes of course its very nice and proper in them to do so we have many most respectable and worthy young women who do the same and are employed by the nobility because being the daughters of gentlemen they are both well bred and accomplished you know said miss kate in a patronizing tone that hurt megs pride and made her work seem not only more distasteful but degrading  did the german song suit miss march inquired mr brooke breaking an awkward pause  oh yes it was very sweet and im much obliged to whoever translated it for me and megs downcast face brightened as she spoke  dont you read german asked miss kate with a look of surprise  not very well my father who taught me is away and i dont get on very fast alone for ive no one to correct my pronunciation  try a little now here is schillers mary stuart and a tutor who loves to teach and mr brooke laid his book on her lap with an inviting smile  its so hard im afraid to try said meg grateful but bashful in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her  ill read a bit to encourage you and miss kate read one of the most beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but perfectly expressionless manner  mr brooke made no comment as she returned the book to meg who said innocently i thought it was poetry  some of it is try this passage  there was a queer smile about mr brookes mouth as he opened at poor marys lament  meg obediently following the long grassblade which her new tutor used to point with read slowly and timidly unconsciously making poetry of the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice down the page went the green guide and presently forgetting her listener in the beauty of the sad scene meg read as if alone giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen if she had seen the brown eyes then she would have stopped short but she never looked up and the lesson was not spoiled for her  very well indeed said mr brooke as she paused quite ignoring her many mistakes and looking as if he did indeed love to teach  miss kate put up her glass and having taken a survey of the little tableau before her shut her sketch book saying with condescension youve a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader i advise you to learn for german is a valuable accomplishment to teachers i must look after grace she is romping and miss kate strolled away adding to herself with a shrug i didnt come to chaperone a governess though she is young and pretty what odd people these yankees are im afraid laurie will be quite spoiled among them  i forgot that english people rather turn up their noses at governesses and dont treat them as we do said meg looking after the retreating figure with an annoyed expression  tutors also have rather a hard time of it there as i know to my sorrow theres no place like america for us workers miss margaret and mr brooke looked so contented and cheerful that meg was ashamed to lament her hard lot  im glad i live in it then i dont like my work but i get a good deal of satisfaction out of it after all so i wont complain i only wished i liked teaching as you do  i think you would if you had laurie for a pupil i shall be very sorry to lose him next year said mr brooke busily punching holes in the turf  going to college i suppose megs lips asked the question but her eyes added and what becomes of you  yes its high time he went for he is ready and as soon as he is off i shall turn soldier i am needed  i am glad of that exclaimed meg i should think every young man would want to go though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who stay at home she added sorrowfully  i have neither and very few friends to care whether i live or die said mr brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the hole he had made and covered it up like a little grave  laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal and we should all be very sorry to have any harm happen to you said meg heartily  thank you that sounds pleasant began mr brooke looking cheerful again but before he could finish his speech ned mounted on the old horse came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the young ladies and there was no more quiet that day  dont you love to ride asked grace of amy as they stood resting after a race round the field with the others led by ned  i dote upon it my sister meg used to ride when papa was rich but we dont keep any horses now except ellen tree added amy laughing  tell me about ellen tree is it a donkey asked grace curiously  why you see jo is crazy about horses and so am i but weve only got an old sidesaddle and no horse out in our garden is an apple tree that has a nice low branch so jo put the saddle on it fixed some reins on the part that turns up and we bounce away on ellen tree whenever we like  how funny laughed grace i have a pony at home and ride nearly every day in the park with fred and kate its very nice for my friends go too and the row is full of ladies and gentlemen  dear how charming i hope i shall go abroad some day but id rather go to rome than the row said amy who had not the remotest idea what the row was and wouldnt have asked for the world  frank sitting just behind the little girls heard what they were saying and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical gymnastics beth who was collecting the scattered author cards looked up and said in her shy yet friendly way im afraid you are tired can i do anything for you  talk to me please its dull sitting by myself answered frank who had evidently been used to being made much of at home  if he asked her to deliver a latin oration it would not have seemed a more impossible task to bashful beth but there was no place to run to no jo to hide behind now and the poor boy looked so wistfully at her that she bravely resolved to try  what do you like to talk about she asked fumbling over the cards and dropping half as she tried to tie them up  well i like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting said frank who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his strength  my heart what shall i do i dont know anything about them thought beth and forgetting the boys misfortune in her flurry she said hoping to make him talk i never saw any hunting but i suppose you know all about it  i did once but i can never hunt again for i got hurt leaping a confounded fivebarred gate so there are no more horses and hounds for me said frank with a sigh that made beth hate herself for her innocent blunder  your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes she said turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she had read one of the boys books in which jo delighted  buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory and in her eagerness to amuse another beth forgot herself and was quite unconscious of her sisters surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of beth talking away to one of the dreadful boys against whom she had begged protection  bless her heart she pities him so she is good to him said jo beaming at her from the croquet ground  i always said she was a little saint added meg as if there could be no further doubt of it  i havent heard frank laugh so much for ever so long said grace to amy as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out of the acorn cups  my sister beth is a very fastidious girl when she likes to be said amy well pleased at beths success she meant facinating but as grace didnt know the exact meaning of either word fastidious sounded well and made a good impression  an impromptu circus fox and geese and an amicable game of croquet finished the afternoon at sunset the tent was struck hampers packed wickets pulled up boats loaded and the whole party floated down the river singing at the tops of their voices ned getting sentimental warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain  alone alone ah woe alone   and at the lines  we each are young we each have a heart oh why should we stand thus coldly apart   he looked at meg with such a lackadaisical expression that she laughed outright and spoiled his song  how can you be so cruel to me he whispered under cover of a lively chorus youve kept close to that starchedup englishwoman all day and now you snub me  i didnt mean to but you looked so funny i really couldnt help it replied meg passing over the first part of his reproach for it was quite true that she had shunned him remembering the moffat party and the talk after it  ned was offended and turned to sallie for consolation saying to her rather pettishly there isnt a bit of flirt in that girl is there  not a particle but shes a dear returned sallie defending her friend even while confessing her shortcomings  shes not a stricken deer anyway said ned trying to be witty and succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do  on the lawn where it had gathered the little party separated with cordial good nights and goodbyes for the vaughns were going to canada as the four sisters went home through the garden miss kate looked after them saying without the patronizing tone in her voice in spite of their demonstrative manners american girls are very nice when one knows them  i quite agree with you said mr brooke     chapter thirteen castles in the air   laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm september afternoon wondering what his neighbors were about but too lazy to go and find out he was in one of his moods for the day had been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory and he was wishing he could live it over again the hot weather made him indolent and he had shirked his studies tried mr brookes patience to the utmost displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon frightened the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that one of his dogs was going mad and after high words with the stableman about some fancied neglect of his horse he had flung himself into his hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general till the peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself staring up into the green gloom of the horsechestnut trees above him he dreamed dreams of all sorts and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a flash peeping through the meshes of the hammock he saw the marches coming out as if bound on some expedition  what in the world are those girls about now thought laurie opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look for there was something rather peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors each wore a large flapping hat a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder and carried a long staff meg had a cushion jo a book beth a basket and amy a portfolio all walked quietly through the garden out at the little back gate and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river  well thats cool said laurie to himself to have a picnic and never ask me they cant be going in the boat for they havent got the key perhaps they forgot it ill take it to them and see whats going on  though possessed of half a dozen hats it took him some time to find one then there was a hunt for the key which was at last discovered in his pocket so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped the fence and ran after them taking the shortest way to the boathouse he waited for them to appear but no one came and he went up the hill to take an observation a grove of pines covered one part of it and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets  heres a landscape thought laurie peeping through the bushes and looking wideawake and goodnatured already  it was a rather pretty little picture for the sisters sat together in the shady nook with sun and shadow flickering over them the aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks and all the little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no strangers but old friends meg sat upon her cushion sewing daintily with her white hands and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her pink dress among the green beth was sorting the cones that lay thick under the hemlock near by for she made pretty things with them amy was sketching a group of ferns and jo was knitting as she read aloud a shadow passed over the boys face as he watched them feeling that he ought to go away because uninvited yet lingering because home seemed very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his restless spirit he stood so still that a squirrel busy with its harvesting ran down a pine close beside him saw him suddenly and skipped back scolding so shrilly that beth looked up espied the wistful face behind the birches and beckoned with a reassuring smile  may i come in please or shall i be a bother he asked advancing slowly  meg lifted her eyebrows but jo scowled at her defiantly and said at once of course you may we should have asked you before only we thought you wouldnt care for such a girls game as this  i always like your games but if meg doesnt want me ill go away  ive no objection if you do something its against the rules to be idle here replied meg gravely but graciously  much obliged ill do anything if youll let me stop a bit for its as dull as the desert of sahara down there shall i sew read cone draw or do all at once bring on your bears im ready and laurie sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold  finish this story while i set my heel said jo handing him the book  yesm was the meek answer as he began doing his best to prove his gratitude for the favor of admission into the busy bee society  the story was not a long one and when it was finished he ventured to ask a few questions as a reward of merit  please maam could i inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one  would you tell him asked meg of her sisters  hell laugh said amy warningly  who cares said jo  i guess hell like it added beth  of course i shall i give you my word i wont laugh tell away jo and dont be afraid  the idea of being afraid of you well you see we used to play pilgrims progress and we have been going on with it in earnest all winter and summer  yes i know said laurie nodding wisely  who told you demanded jo  spirits  no i did i wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away and he was rather dismal he did like it so dont scold jo said beth meekly  you cant keep a secret never mind it saves trouble now  go on please said laurie as jo became absorbed in her work looking a trifle displeased  oh didnt she tell you about this new plan of ours well we have tried not to waste our holiday but each has had a task and worked at it with a will the vacation is nearly over the stints are all done and we are ever so glad that we didnt dawdle  yes i should think so and laurie thought regretfully of his own idle days  mother likes to have us outofdoors as much as possible so we bring our work here and have nice times for the fun of it we bring our things in these bags wear the old hats use poles to climb the hill and play pilgrims as we used to do years ago we call this hill the delectable mountain for we can look far away and see the country where we hope to live some time  jo pointed and laurie sat up to examine for through an opening in the wood one could look cross the wide blue river the meadows on the other side far over the outskirts of the great city to the green hills that rose to meet the sky the sun was low and the heavens glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset gold and purple clouds lay on the hilltops and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some celestial city  how beautiful that is said laurie softly for he was quick to see and feel beauty of any kind  its often so and we like to watch it for it is never the same but always splendid replied amy wishing she could paint it  jo talks about the country where we hope to live sometimethe real country she means with pigs and chickens and haymaking it would be nice but i wish the beautiful country up there was real and we could ever go to it said beth musingly  there is a lovelier country even than that where we shall go byandby when we are good enough answered meg with her sweetest voice  it seems so long to wait so hard to do i want to fly away at once as those swallows fly and go in at that splendid gate  youll get there beth sooner or later no fear of that said jo im the one that will have to fight and work and climb and wait and maybe never get in after all  youll have me for company if thats any comfort i shall have to do a deal of traveling before i come in sight of your celestial city if i arrive late youll say a good word for me wont you beth  something in the boys face troubled his little friend but she said cheerfully with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds if people really want to go and really try all their lives i think they will get in for i dont believe there are any locks on that door or any guards at the gate i always imagine it is as it is in the picture where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor christian as he comes up from the river  wouldnt it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could come true and we could live in them said jo after a little pause  ive made such quantities it would be hard to choose which id have said laurie lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had betrayed him  youd have to take your favorite one what is it asked meg  if i tell mine will you tell yours  yes if the girls will too  we will now laurie  after id seen as much of the world as i want to id like to settle in germany and have just as much music as i choose im to be a famous musician myself and all creation is to rush to hear me and im never to be bothered about money or business but just enjoy myself and live for what i like thats my favorite castle whats yours meg  margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers and waved a brake before her face as if to disperse imaginary gnats while she said slowly i should like a lovely house full of all sorts of luxurious thingsnice food pretty clothes handsome furniture pleasant people and heaps of money i am to be mistress of it and manage it as i like with plenty of servants so i never need work a bit how i should enjoy it for i wouldnt be idle but do good and make everyone love me dearly  wouldnt you have a master for your castle in the air asked laurie slyly  i said pleasant people you know and meg carefully tied up her shoe as she spoke so that no one saw her face  why dont you say youd have a splendid wise good husband and some angelic little children you know your castle wouldnt be perfect without said blunt jo who had no tender fancies yet and rather scorned romance except in books  youd have nothing but horses inkstands and novels in yours answered meg petulantly  wouldnt i though id have a stable full of arabian steeds rooms piled high with books and id write out of a magic inkstand so that my works should be as famous as lauries music i want to do something splendid before i go into my castle something heroic or wonderful that wont be forgotten after im dead i dont know what but im on the watch for it and mean to astonish you all some day i think i shall write books and get rich and famous that would suit me so that is my favorite dream  mine is to stay at home safe with father and mother and help take care of the family said beth contentedly  dont you wish for anything else asked laurie  since i had my little piano i am perfectly satisfied i only wish we may all keep well and be together nothing else  i have ever so many wishes but the pet one is to be an artist and go to rome and do fine pictures and be the best artist in the whole world was amys modest desire  were an ambitious set arent we every one of us but beth wants to be rich and famous and gorgeous in every respect i do wonder if any of us will ever get our wishes said laurie chewing grass like a meditative calf  ive got the key to my castle in the air but whether i can unlock the door remains to be seen observed jo mysteriously  ive got the key to mine but im not allowed to try it hang college muttered laurie with an impatient sigh  heres mine and amy waved her pencil  i havent got any said meg forlornly  yes you have said laurie at once  where  in your face  nonsense thats of no use  wait and see if it doesnt bring you something worth having replied the boy laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he fancied he knew  meg colored behind the brake but asked no questions and looked across the river with the same expectant expression which mr brooke had worn when he told the story of the knight  if we are all alive ten years hence lets meet and see how many of us have got our wishes or how much nearer we are then than now said jo always ready with a plan  bless me how old i shall be twentyseven exclaimed meg who felt grown up already having just reached seventeen  you and i will be twentysix teddy beth twentyfour and amy twentytwo what a venerable party said jo  i hope i shall have done something to be proud of by that time but im such a lazy dog im afraid i shall dawdle jo  you need a motive mother says and when you get it she is sure youll work splendidly  is she by jupiter i will if i only get the chance cried laurie sitting up with sudden energy i ought to be satisfied to please grandfather and i do try but its working against the grain you see and comes hard he wants me to be an india merchant as he was and id rather be shot i hate tea and silk and spices and every sort of rubbish his old ships bring and i dont care how soon they go to the bottom when i own them going to college ought to satisfy him for if i give him four years he ought to let me off from the business but hes set and ive got to do just as he did unless i break away and please myself as my father did if there was anyone left to stay with the old gentleman id do it tomorrow  laurie spoke excitedly and looked ready to carry his threat into execution on the slightest provocation for he was growing up very fast and in spite of his indolent ways had a young mans hatred of subjection a young mans restless longing to try the world for himself  i advise you to sail away in one of your ships and never come home again till you have tried your own way said jo whose imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit and whose sympathy was excited by what she called teddys wrongs  thats not right jo you mustnt talk in that way and laurie mustnt take your bad advice you should do just what your grandfather wishes my dear boy said meg in her most maternal tone do your best at college and when he sees that you try to please him im sure he wont be hard on you or unjust to you as you say there is no one else to stay with and love him and youd never forgive yourself if you left him without his permission dont be dismal or fret but do your duty and youll get your reward as good mr brooke has by being respected and loved  what do you know about him asked laurie grateful for the good advice but objecting to the lecture and glad to turn the conversation from himself after his unusual outbreak  only what your grandpa told us about him how he took good care of his own mother till she died and wouldnt go abroad as tutor to some nice person because he wouldnt leave her and how he provides now for an old woman who nursed his mother and never tells anyone but is just as generous and patient and good as he can be  so he is dear old fellow said laurie heartily as meg paused looking flushed and earnest with her story its like grandpa to find out all about him without letting him know and to tell all his goodness to others so that they might like him brooke couldnt understand why your mother was so kind to him asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly way he thought she was just perfect and talked about it for days and days and went on about you all in flaming style if ever i do get my wish you see what ill do for brooke  begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out said meg sharply  how do you know i do miss  i can always tell by his face when he goes away if you have been good he looks satisfied and walks briskly if you have plagued him hes sober and walks slowly as if he wanted to go back and do his work better  well i like that so you keep an account of my good and bad marks in brookes face do you i see him bow and smile as he passes your window but i didnt know youd got up a telegraph  we havent dont be angry and oh dont tell him i said anything it was only to show that i cared how you get on and what is said here is said in confidence you know cried meg much alarmed at the thought of what might follow from her careless speech  i dont tell tales replied laurie with his high and mighty air as jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore only if brooke is going to be a thermometer i must mind and have fair weather for him to report  please dont be offended i didnt mean to preach or tell tales or be silly i only thought jo was encouraging you in a feeling which youd be sorry for byandby you are so kind to us we feel as if you were our brother and say just what we think forgive me i meant it kindly and meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid  ashamed of his momentary pique laurie squeezed the kind little hand and said frankly im the one to be forgiven im cross and have been out of sorts all day i like to have you tell me my faults and be sisterly so dont mind if i am grumpy sometimes i thank you all the same  bent on showing that he was not offended he made himself as agreeable as possible wound cotton for meg recited poetry to please jo shook down cones for beth and helped amy with her ferns proving himself a fit person to belong to the busy bee society in the midst of an animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles one of those amiable creatures having strolled up from the river the faint sound of a bell warned them that hannah had put the tea to draw and they would just have time to get home to supper  may i come again asked laurie  yes if you are good and love your book as the boys in the primer are told to do said meg smiling  ill try  then you may come and ill teach you to knit as the scotchmen do theres a demand for socks just now added jo waving hers like a big blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate  that night when beth played to mr laurence in the twilight laurie standing in the shadow of the curtain listened to the little david whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit and watched the old man who sat with his gray head on his hand thinking tender thoughts of the dead child he had loved so much remembering the conversation of the afternoon the boy said to himself with the resolve to make the sacrifice cheerfully ill let my castle go and stay with the dear old gentleman while he needs me for i am all he has     chapter fourteen secrets   jo was very busy in the garret for the october days began to grow chilly and the afternoons were short for two or three hours the sun lay warmly in the high window showing jo seated on the old sofa writing busily with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her while scrabble the pet rat promenaded the beams overhead accompanied by his oldest son a fine young fellow who was evidently very proud of his whiskers quite absorbed in her work jo scribbled away till the last page was filled when she signed her name with a flourish and threw down her pen exclaiming  there ive done my best if this wont suit i shall have to wait till i can do better  lying back on the sofa she read the manuscript carefully through making dashes here and there and putting in many exclamation points which looked like little balloons then she tied it up with a smart red ribbon and sat a minute looking at it with a sober wistful expression which plainly showed how earnest her work had been jos desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall in it she kept her papers and a few books safely shut away from scrabble who being likewise of a literary turn was fond of making a circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the leaves from this tin receptacle jo produced another manuscript and putting both in her pocket crept quietly downstairs leaving her friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink  she put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible and going to the back entry window got out upon the roof of a low porch swung herself down to the grassy bank and took a roundabout way to the road once there she composed herself hailed a passing omnibus and rolled away to town looking very merry and mysterious  if anyone had been watching her he would have thought her movements decidedly peculiar for on alighting she went off at a great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy street having found the place with some difficulty she went into the doorway looked up the dirty stairs and after standing stock still a minute suddenly dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came this maneuver she repeated several times to the great amusement of a blackeyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building opposite on returning for the third time jo gave herself a shake pulled her hat over her eyes and walked up the stairs looking as if she were going to have all her teeth out  there was a dentists sign among others which adorned the entrance and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth the young gentleman put on his coat took his hat and went down to post himself in the opposite doorway saying with a smile and a shiver its like her to come alone but if she has a bad time shell need someone to help her home  in ten minutes jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying ordeal of some sort when she saw the young gentleman she looked anything but pleased and passed him with a nod but he followed asking with an air of sympathy did you have a bad time  not very  you got through quickly  yes thank goodness  why did you go alone  didnt want anyone to know  youre the oddest fellow i ever saw how many did you have out  jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him then began to laugh as if mightily amused at something  there are two which i want to have come out but i must wait a week  what are you laughing at you are up to some mischief jo said laurie looking mystified  so are you what were you doing sir up in that billiard saloon  begging your pardon maam it wasnt a billiard saloon but a gymnasium and i was taking a lesson in fencing  im glad of that  why  you can teach me and then when we play hamlet you can be laertes and well make a fine thing of the fencing scene  laurie burst out with a hearty boys laugh which made several passersby smile in spite of themselves  ill teach you whether we play hamlet or not its grand fun and will straighten you up capitally but i dont believe that was your only reason for saying im glad in that decided way was it now  no i was glad that you were not in the saloon because i hope you never go to such places do you  not often  i wish you wouldnt  its no harm jo i have billiards at home but its no fun unless you have good players so as im fond of it i come sometimes and have a game with ned moffat or some of the other fellows  oh dear im so sorry for youll get to liking it better and better and will waste time and money and grow like those dreadful boys i did hope youd stay respectable and be a satisfaction to your friends said jo shaking her head  cant a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without losing his respectability asked laurie looking nettled  that depends upon how and where he takes it i dont like ned and his set and wish youd keep out of it mother wont let us have him at our house though he wants to come and if you grow like him she wont be willing to have us frolic together as we do now  wont she asked laurie anxiously  no she cant bear fashionable young men and shed shut us all up in bandboxes rather than have us associate with them  well she neednt get out her bandboxes yet im not a fashionable party and dont mean to be but i do like harmless larks now and then dont you  yes nobody minds them so lark away but dont get wild will you or there will be an end of all our good times  ill be a double distilled saint  i cant bear saints just be a simple honest respectable boy and well never desert you i dont know what i should do if you acted like mr kings son he had plenty of money but didnt know how to spend it and got tipsy and gambled and ran away and forged his fathers name i believe and was altogether horrid  you think im likely to do the same much obliged  no i dontoh dear nobut i hear people talking about money being such a temptation and i sometimes wish you were poor i shouldnt worry then  do you worry about me jo  a little when you look moody and discontented as you sometimes do for youve got such a strong will if you once get started wrong im afraid it would be hard to stop you  laurie walked in silence a few minutes and jo watched him wishing she had held her tongue for his eyes looked angry though his lips smiled as if at her warnings  are you going to deliver lectures all the way home he asked presently  of course not why  because if you are ill take a bus if youre not id like to walk with you and tell you something very interesting  i wont preach any more and id like to hear the news immensely  very well then come on its a secret and if i tell you you must tell me yours  i havent got any began jo but stopped suddenly remembering that she had  you know you haveyou cant hide anything so up and fess or i wont tell cried laurie  is your secret a nice one  oh isnt it all about people you know and such fun you ought to hear it and ive been aching to tell it this long time come you begin  youll not say anything about it at home will you  not a word  and you wont tease me in private  i never tease  yes you do you get everything you want out of people i dont know how you do it but you are a born wheedler  thank you fire away  well ive left two stories with a newspaperman and hes to give his answer next week whispered jo in her confidants ear  hurrah for miss march the celebrated american authoress cried laurie throwing up his hat and catching it again to the great delight of two ducks four cats five hens and half a dozen irish children for they were out of the city now  hush it wont come to anything i dare say but i couldnt rest till i had tried and i said nothing about it because i didnt want anyone else to be disappointed  it wont fail why jo your stories are works of shakespeare compared to half the rubbish that is published every day wont it be fun to see them in print and shant we feel proud of our authoress  jos eyes sparkled for it is always pleasant to be believed in and a friends praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs  wheres your secret play fair teddy or ill never believe you again she said trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed up at a word of encouragement  i may get into a scrape for telling but i didnt promise not to so i will for i never feel easy in my mind till ive told you any plummy bit of news i get i know where megs glove is  is that all said jo looking disappointed as laurie nodded and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence  its quite enough for the present as youll agree when i tell you where it is  tell then  laurie bent and whispered three words in jos ear which produced a comical change she stood and stared at him for a minute looking both surprised and displeased then walked on saying sharply how do you know  saw it  where  pocket  all this time  yes isnt that romantic  no its horrid  dont you like it  of course i dont its ridiculous it wont be allowed my patience what would meg say  you are not to tell anyone mind that  i didnt promise  that was understood and i trusted you  well i wont for the present anyway but im disgusted and wish you hadnt told me  i thought youd be pleased  at the idea of anybody coming to take meg away no thank you  youll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away  id like to see anyone try it cried jo fiercely  so should i and laurie chuckled at the idea  i dont think secrets agree with me i feel rumpled up in my mind since you told me that said jo rather ungratefully  race down this hill with me and youll be all right suggested laurie  no one was in sight the smooth road sloped invitingly before her and finding the temptation irresistible jo darted away soon leaving hat and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran laurie reached the goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his treatment for his atlanta came panting up with flying hair bright eyes ruddy cheeks and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face  i wish i was a horse then i could run for miles in this splendid air and not lose my breath it was capital but see what a guy its made me go pick up my things like a cherub as you are said jo dropping down under a maple tree which was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves  laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property and jo bundled up her braids hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again but someone did pass and who should it be but meg looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit for she had been making calls  what in the world are you doing here she asked regarding her disheveled sister with wellbred surprise  getting leaves meekly answered jo sorting the rosy handful she had just swept up  and hairpins added laurie throwing half a dozen into jos lap they grow on this road meg so do combs and brown straw hats  you have been running jo how could you when will you stop such romping ways said meg reprovingly as she settled her cuffs and smoothed her hair with which the wind had taken liberties  never till im stiff and old and have to use a crutch dont try to make me grow up before my time meg its hard enough to have you change all of a sudden let me be a little girl as long as i can  as she spoke jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her lips for lately she had felt that margaret was fast getting to be a woman and lauries secret made her dread the separation which must surely come some time and now seemed very near he saw the trouble in her face and drew megs attention from it by asking quickly where have you been calling all so fine  at the gardiners and sallie has been telling me all about belle moffats wedding it was very splendid and they have gone to spend the winter in paris just think how delightful that must be  do you envy her meg said laurie  im afraid i do  im glad of it muttered jo tying on her hat with a jerk  why asked meg looking surprised  because if you care much about riches you will never go and marry a poor man said jo frowning at laurie who was mutely warning her to mind what she said  i shall never go and marry anyone observed meg walking on with great dignity while the others followed laughing whispering skipping stones and behaving like children as meg said to herself though she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress on  for a week or two jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite bewildered she rushed to the door when the postman rang was rude to mr brooke whenever they met would sit looking at meg with a woebegone face occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in a very mysterious manner laurie and she were always making signs to one another and talking about spread eagles till the girls declared they had both lost their wits on the second saturday after jo got out of the window meg as she sat sewing at her window was scandalized by the sight of laurie chasing jo all over the garden and finally capturing her in amys bower what went on there meg could not see but shrieks of laughter were heard followed by the murmur of voices and a great flapping of newspapers  what shall we do with that girl she never will behave like a young lady sighed meg as she watched the race with a disapproving face  i hope she wont she is so funny and dear as she is said beth who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at jos having secrets with anyone but her  its very trying but we never can make her commy la fo added amy who sat making some new frills for herself with her curls tied up in a very becoming way two agreeable things that made her feel unusually elegant and ladylike  in a few minutes jo bounced in laid herself on the sofa and affected to read  have you anything interesting there asked meg with condescension  nothing but a story wont amount to much i guess returned jo carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight  youd better read it aloud that will amuse us and keep you out of mischief said amy in her most grownup tone  whats the name asked beth wondering why jo kept her face behind the sheet  the rival painters  that sounds well read it said meg  with a loud hem and a long breath jo began to read very fast the girls listened with interest for the tale was romantic and somewhat pathetic as most of the characters died in the end i like that about the splendid picture was amys approving remark as jo paused  i prefer the lovering part viola and angelo are two of our favorite names isnt that queer said meg wiping her eyes for the lovering part was tragical  who wrote it asked beth who had caught a glimpse of jos face  the reader suddenly sat up cast away the paper displaying a flushed countenance and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement replied in a loud voice your sister  you cried meg dropping her work  its very good said amy critically  i knew it i knew it oh my jo i am so proud and beth ran to hug her sister and exult over this splendid success  dear me how delighted they all were to be sure how meg wouldnt believe it till she saw the words miss josephine march actually printed in the paper how graciously amy criticized the artistic parts of the story and offered hints for a sequel which unfortunately couldnt be carried out as the hero and heroine were dead how beth got excited and skipped and sang with joy how hannah came in to exclaim sakes alive well i never in great astonishment at that jos doins how proud mrs march was when she knew it how jo laughed with tears in her eyes as she declared she might as well be a peacock and done with it and how the spread eagle might be said to flap his wings triumphantly over the house of march as the paper passed from hand to hand  tell us about it when did it come how much did you get for it what will father say wont laurie laugh cried the family all in one breath as they clustered about jo for these foolish affectionate people made a jubilee of every little household joy  stop jabbering girls and ill tell you everything said jo wondering if miss burney felt any grander over her evelina than she did over her rival painters having told how she disposed of her tales jo added and when i went to get my answer the man said he liked them both but didnt pay beginners only let them print in his paper and noticed the stories it was good practice he said and when the beginners improved anyone would pay so i let him have the two stories and today this was sent to me and laurie caught me with it and insisted on seeing it so i let him and he said it was good and i shall write more and hes going to get the next paid for and i am so happy for in time i may be able to support myself and help the girls  jos breath gave out here and wrapping her head in the paper she bedewed her little story with a few natural tears for to be independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest wishes of her heart and this seemed to be the first step toward that happy end     chapter fifteen a telegram   november is the most disagreeable month in the whole year said margaret standing at the window one dull afternoon looking out at the frostbitten garden  thats the reason i was born in it observed jo pensively quite unconscious of the blot on her nose  if something very pleasant should happen now we should think it a delightful month said beth who took a hopeful view of everything even november  i dare say but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this family said meg who was out of sorts we go grubbing along day after day without a bit of change and very little fun we might as well be in a treadmill  my patience how blue we are cried jo i dont much wonder poor dear for you see other girls having splendid times while you grind grind year in and year out oh dont i wish i could manage things for you as i do for my heroines youre pretty enough and good enough already so id have some rich relation leave you a fortune unexpectedly then youd dash out as an heiress scorn everyone who has slighted you go abroad and come home my lady something in a blaze of splendor and elegance  people dont have fortunes left them in that style nowadays men have to work and women marry for money its a dreadfully unjust world said meg bitterly  jo and i are going to make fortunes for you all just wait ten years and see if we dont said amy who sat in a corner making mud pies as hannah called her little clay models of birds fruit and faces  cant wait and im afraid i havent much faith in ink and dirt though im grateful for your good intentions  meg sighed and turned to the frostbitten garden again jo groaned and leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude but amy spatted away energetically and beth who sat at the other window said smiling two pleasant things are going to happen right away marmee is coming down the street and laurie is tramping through the garden as if he had something nice to tell  in they both came mrs march with her usual question any letter from father girls and laurie to say in his persuasive way wont some of you come for a drive ive been working away at mathematics till my head is in a muddle and im going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn its a dull day but the air isnt bad and im going to take brooke home so it will be gay inside if it isnt out come jo you and beth will go wont you  of course we will  much obliged but im busy and meg whisked out her workbasket for she had agreed with her mother that it was best for her at least not to drive too often with the young gentleman  we three will be ready in a minute cried amy running away to wash her hands  can i do anything for you madam mother asked laurie leaning over mrs marchs chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave her  no thank you except call at the office if youll be so kind dear its our day for a letter and the postman hasnt been father is as regular as the sun but theres some delay on the way perhaps  a sharp ring interrupted her and a minute after hannah came in with a letter  its one of them horrid telegraph things mum she said handling it as if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage  at the word telegraph mrs march snatched it read the two lines it contained and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart laurie dashed downstairs for water while meg and hannah supported her and jo read aloud in a frightened voice  mrs march  your husband is very ill come at once s hale blank hospital washington   how still the room was as they listened breathlessly how strangely the day darkened outside and how suddenly the whole world seemed to change as the girls gathered about their mother feeling as if all the happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them  mrs march was herself again directly read the message over and stretched out her arms to her daughters saying in a tone they never forgot i shall go at once but it may be too late oh children children help me to bear it  for several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the room mingled with broken words of comfort tender assurances of help and hopeful whispers that died away in tears poor hannah was the first to recover and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a good example for with her work was panacea for most afflictions  the lord keep the dear man i wont waste no time acryin but git your things ready right away mum she said heartily as she wiped her face on her apron gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her own hard one and went away to work like three women in one  shes right theres no time for tears now be calm girls and let me think  they tried to be calm poor things as their mother sat up looking pale but steady and put away her grief to think and plan for them  wheres laurie she asked presently when she had collected her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done  here maam oh let me do something cried the boy hurrying from the next room whither he had withdrawn feeling that their first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see  send a telegram saying i will come at once the next train goes early in the morning ill take that  what else the horses are ready i can go anywhere do anything he said looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth  leave a note at aunt marchs jo give me that pen and paper  tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages jo drew the table before her mother well knowing that money for the long sad journey must be borrowed and feeling as if she could do anything to add a little to the sum for her father  now go dear but dont kill yourself driving at a desperate pace there is no need of that  mrs marchs warning was evidently thrown away for five minutes later laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse riding as if for his life  jo run to the rooms and tell mrs king that i cant come on the way get these things ill put them down theyll be needed and i must go prepared for nursing hospital stores are not always good beth go and ask mr laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine im not too proud to beg for father he shall have the best of everything amy tell hannah to get down the black trunk and meg come and help me find my things for im half bewildered  writing thinking and directing all at once might well bewilder the poor lady and meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little while and let them work everyone scattered like leaves before a gust of wind and the quiet happy household was broken up as suddenly as if the paper had been an evil spell  mr laurence came hurrying back with beth bringing every comfort the kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid and friendliest promises of protection for the girls during the mothers absence which comforted her very much there was nothing he didnt offer from his own dressing gown to himself as escort but the last was impossible mrs march would not hear of the old gentlemans undertaking the long journey yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it for anxiety ill fits one for traveling he saw the look knit his heavy eyebrows rubbed his hands and marched abruptly away saying hed be back directly no one had time to think of him again till as meg ran through the entry with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the other she came suddenly upon mr brooke  im very sorry to hear of this miss march he said in the kind quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit i came to offer myself as escort to your mother mr laurence has commissions for me in washington and it will give me real satisfaction to be of service to her there  down dropped the rubbers and the tea was very near following as meg put out her hand with a face so full of gratitude that mr brooke would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling one of time and comfort which he was about to take  how kind you all are mother will accept im sure and it will be such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her thank you very very much  meg spoke earnestly and forgot herself entirely till something in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea and lead the way into the parlor saying she would call her mother  everything was arranged by the time laurie returned with a note from aunt march enclosing the desired sum and a few lines repeating what she had often said before that she had always told them it was absurd for march to go into the army always predicted that no good would come of it and she hoped they would take her advice the next time mrs march put the note in the fire the money in her purse and went on with her preparations with her lips folded tightly in a way which jo would have understood if she had been there  the short afternoon wore away all other errands were done and meg and her mother busy at some necessary needlework while beth and amy got tea and hannah finished her ironing with what she called a slap and a bang but still jo did not come they began to get anxious and laurie went off to find her for no one knew what freak jo might take into her head he missed her however and she came walking in with a very queer expression of countenance for there was a mixture of fun and fear satisfaction and regret in it which puzzled the family as much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother saying with a little choke in her voice thats my contribution toward making father comfortable and bringing him home  my dear where did you get it twentyfive dollars jo i hope you havent done anything rash  no its mine honestly i didnt beg borrow or steal it i earned it and i dont think youll blame me for i only sold what was my own  as she spoke jo took off her bonnet and a general outcry arose for all her abundant hair was cut short  your hair your beautiful hair oh jo how could you your one beauty my dear girl there was no need of this she doesnt look like my jo any more but i love her dearly for it  as everyone exclaimed and beth hugged the cropped head tenderly jo assumed an indifferent air which did not deceive anyone a particle and said rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked it it doesnt affect the fate of the nation so dont wail beth it will be good for my vanity i was getting too proud of my wig it will do my brains good to have that mop taken off my head feels deliciously light and cool and the barber said i could soon have a curly crop which will be boyish becoming and easy to keep in order im satisfied so please take the money and lets have supper  tell me all about it jo i am not quite satisfied but i cant blame you for i know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity as you call it to your love but my dear it was not necessary and im afraid you will regret it one of these days said mrs march  no i wont returned jo stoutly feeling much relieved that her prank was not entirely condemned  what made you do it asked amy who would as soon have thought of cutting off her head as her pretty hair  well i was wild to do something for father replied jo as they gathered about the table for healthy young people can eat even in the midst of trouble i hate to borrow as much as mother does and i knew aunt march would croak she always does if you ask for a ninepence meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent and i only got some clothes with mine so i felt wicked and was bound to have some money if i sold the nose off my face to get it  you neednt feel wicked my child you had no winter things and got the simplest with your own hard earnings said mrs march with a look that warmed jos heart  i hadnt the least idea of selling my hair at first but as i went along i kept thinking what i could do and feeling as if id like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself in a barbers window i saw tails of hair with the prices marked and one black tail not so thick as mine was forty dollars it came to me all of a sudden that i had one thing to make money out of and without stopping to think i walked in asked if they bought hair and what they would give for mine  i dont see how you dared to do it said beth in a tone of awe  oh he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his hair he rather stared at first as if he wasnt used to having girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair he said he didnt care about mine it wasnt the fashionable color and he never paid much for it in the first place the work put into it made it dear and so on it was getting late and i was afraid if it wasnt done right away that i shouldnt have it done at all and you know when i start to do a thing i hate to give it up so i begged him to take it and told him why i was in such a hurry it was silly i dare say but it changed his mind for i got rather excited and told the story in my topsyturvy way and his wife heard and said so kindly take it thomas and oblige the young lady id do as much for our jimmy any day if i had a spire of hair worth selling  who was jimmy asked amy who liked to have things explained as they went along  her son she said who was in the army how friendly such things make strangers feel dont they she talked away all the time the man clipped and diverted my mind nicely  didnt you feel dreadfully when the first cut came asked meg with a shiver  i took a last look at my hair while the man got his things and that was the end of it i never snivel over trifles like that i will confess though i felt queer when i saw the dear old hair laid out on the table and felt only the short rough ends of my head it almost seemed as if id an arm or leg off the woman saw me look at it and picked out a long lock for me to keep ill give it to you marmee just to remember past glories by for a crop is so comfortable i dont think i shall ever have a mane again  mrs march folded the wavy chestnut lock and laid it away with a short gray one in her desk she only said thank you deary but something in her face made the girls change the subject and talk as cheerfully as they could about mr brookes kindness the prospect of a fine day tomorrow and the happy times they would have when father came home to be nursed  no one wanted to go to bed when at ten oclock mrs march put by the last finished job and said come girls beth went to the piano and played the fathers favorite hymn all began bravely but broke down one by one till beth was left alone singing with all her heart for to her music was always a sweet consoler  go to bed and dont talk for we must be up early and shall need all the sleep we can get good night my darlings said mrs march as the hymn ended for no one cared to try another  they kissed her quietly and went to bed as silently as if the dear invalid lay in the next room beth and amy soon fell asleep in spite of the great trouble but meg lay awake thinking the most serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life jo lay motionless and her sister fancied that she was asleep till a stifled sob made her exclaim as she touched a wet cheek  jo dear what is it are you crying about father  no not now  what then  my my hair burst out poor jo trying vainly to smother her emotion in the pillow  it did not seem at all comical to meg who kissed and caressed the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner  im not sorry protested jo with a choke id do it again tomorrow if i could its only the vain part of me that goes and cries in this silly way dont tell anyone its all over now i thought you were asleep so i just made a little private moan for my one beauty how came you to be awake  i cant sleep im so anxious said meg  think about something pleasant and youll soon drop off  i tried it but felt wider awake than ever  what did you think of  handsome faceseyes particularly answered meg smiling to herself in the dark  what color do you like best  brown that is sometimes blue are lovely  jo laughed and meg sharply ordered her not to talk then amiably promised to make her hair curl and fell asleep to dream of living in her castle in the air  the clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed smoothing a coverlet here settling a pillow there and pausing to look long and tenderly at each unconscious face to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed and to pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter as she lifted the curtain to look out into the dreary night the moon broke suddenly from behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright benignant face which seemed to whisper in the silence be comforted dear soul there is always light behind the clouds     chapter sixteen letters   in the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before for now the shadow of a real trouble had come the little books were full of help and comfort and as they dressed they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them everything seemed very strange when they went down so dim and still outside so full of light and bustle within breakfast at that early hour seemed odd and even hannahs familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on the big trunk stood ready in the hall mothers cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa and mother herself sat trying to eat but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution megs eyes kept filling in spite of herself jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more than once and the little girls wore a grave troubled expression as if sorrow was a new experience to them  nobody talked much but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting for the carriage mrs march said to the girls who were all busied about her one folding her shawl another smoothing out the strings of her bonnet a third putting on her overshoes and a fourth fastening up her travelling bag  children i leave you to hannahs care and mr laurences protection hannah is faithfulness itself and our good neighbor will guard you as if you were his own i have no fears for you yet i am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly dont grieve and fret when i am gone or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget go on with your work as usual for work is a blessed solace hope and keep busy and whatever happens remember that you never can be fatherless  yes mother  meg dear be prudent watch over your sisters consult hannah and in any perplexity go to mr laurence be patient jo dont get despondent or do rash things write to me often and be my brave girl ready to help and cheer all beth comfort yourself with your music and be faithful to the little home duties and you amy help all you can be obedient and keep happy safe at home  we will mother we will  the rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen that was the hard minute but the girls stood it well no one cried no one ran away or uttered a lamentation though their hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to father remembering as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver them they kissed their mother quietly clung about her tenderly and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away  laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off and mr brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him mr greatheart on the spot  goodby my darlings god bless and keep us all whispered mrs march as she kissed one dear little face after the other and hurried into the carriage  as she rolled away the sun came out and looking back she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen they saw it also and smiled and waved their hands and the last thing she beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces and behind them like a bodyguard old mr laurence faithful hannah and devoted laurie  how kind everyone is to us she said turning to find fresh proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young mans face  i dont see how they can help it returned mr brooke laughing so infectiously that mrs march could not help smiling and so the journey began with the good omens of sunshine smiles and cheerful words  i feel as if there had been an earthquake said jo as their neighbors went home to breakfast leaving them to rest and refresh themselves  it seems as if half the house was gone added meg forlornly  beth opened her lips to say something but could only point to the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on mothers table showing that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them it was a little thing but it went straight to their hearts and in spite of their brave resolutions they all broke down and cried bitterly  hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings and when the shower showed signs of clearing up she came to the rescue armed with a coffeepot  now my dear young ladies remember what your ma said and dont fret come and have a cup of coffee all round and then lets fall to work and be a credit to the family  coffee was a treat and hannah showed great tact in making it that morning no one could resist her persuasive nods or the fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot they drew up to the table exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins and in ten minutes were all right again  hope and keep busy thats the motto for us so lets see who will remember it best i shall go to aunt march as usual oh wont she lecture though said jo as she sipped with returning spirit  i shall go to my kings though id much rather stay at home and attend to things here said meg wishing she hadnt made her eyes so red  no need of that beth and i can keep house perfectly well put in amy with an important air  hannah will tell us what to do and well have everything nice when you come home added beth getting out her mop and dish tub without delay  i think anxiety is very interesting observed amy eating sugar pensively  the girls couldnt help laughing and felt better for it though meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugar bowl  the sight of the turnovers made jo sober again and when the two went out to their daily tasks they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their mothers face it was gone but beth had remembered the little household ceremony and there she was nodding away at them like a rosyfaced mandarin  thats so like my beth said jo waving her hat with a grateful face goodbye meggy i hope the kings wont strain today dont fret about father dear she added as they parted  and i hope aunt march wont croak your hair is becoming and it looks very boyish and nice returned meg trying not to smile at the curly head which looked comically small on her tall sisters shoulders  thats my only comfort and touching her hat a la laurie away went jo feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day  news from their father comforted the girls very much for though dangerously ill the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had already done him good mr brooke sent a bulletin every day and as the head of the family meg insisted on reading the dispatches which grew more cheerful as the week passed at first everyone was eager to write and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters who felt rather important with their washington correspondence as one of these packets contained characteristic notes from the party we will rob an imaginary mail and read them  my dearest mother    it is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us for the news was so good we couldnt help laughing and crying over it how very kind mr brooke is and how fortunate that mr laurences business detains him near you so long since he is so useful to you and father the girls are all as good as gold jo helps me with the sewing and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs i should be afraid she might overdo if i didnt know her moral fit wouldnt last long beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock and never forgets what you told her she grieves about father and looks sober except when she is at her little piano amy minds me nicely and i take great care of her she does her own hair and i am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings she tries very hard and i know you will be pleased with her improvement when you come mr laurence watches over us like a motherly old hen as jo says and laurie is very kind and neighborly he and jo keep us merry for we get pretty blue sometimes and feel like orphans with you so far away hannah is a perfect saint she does not scold at all and always calls me miss margaret which is quite proper you know and treats me with respect we are all well and busy but we long day and night to have you back give my dearest love to father and believe me ever your own   meg   this note prettily written on scented paper was a great contrast to the next which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curlytailed letters  my precious marmee    three cheers for dear father brooke was a trump to telegraph right off and let us know the minute he was better i rushed up garret when the letter came and tried to thank god for being so good to us but i could only cry and say im glad im glad didnt that do as well as a regular prayer for i felt a great many in my heart we have such funny times and now i can enjoy them for everyone is so desperately good its like living in a nest of turtledoves youd laugh to see meg head the table and try to be motherish she gets prettier every day and im in love with her sometimes the children are regular archangels and iwell im jo and never shall be anything else oh i must tell you that i came near having a quarrel with laurie i freed my mind about a silly little thing and he was offended i was right but didnt speak as i ought and he marched home saying he wouldnt come again till i begged pardon i declared i wouldnt and got mad it lasted all day i felt bad and wanted you very much laurie and i are both so proud its hard to beg pardon but i thought hed come to it for i was in the right he didnt come and just at night i remembered what you said when amy fell into the river i read my little book felt better resolved not to let

neighborhood it was really amazing for everyone seemed in a heavenly frame of mind and selfdenial was all the fashion relieved of their first anxiety about their father the girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little and began to fall back into old ways they did not forget their motto but hoping and keeping busy seemed to grow easier and after such tremendous exertions they felt that endeavor deserved a holiday and gave it a good many  jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough and was ordered to stay at home till she was better for aunt march didnt like to hear people read with colds in their heads jo liked this and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar subsided on the sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books amy found that housework and art did not go well together and returned to her mud pies meg went daily to her pupils and sewed or thought she did at home but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother or reading the washington dispatches over and over beth kept on with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving  all the little duties were faithfully done each day and many of her sisters also for they were forgetful and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone avisiting when her heart got heavy with longings for mother or fears for father she went away into a certain closet hid her face in the folds of a dear old gown and made her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit but everyone felt how sweet and helpful beth was and fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small affairs  all were unconscious that this experience was a test of character and when the first excitement was over felt that they had done well and deserved praise so they did but their mistake was in ceasing to do well and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret  meg i wish youd go and see the hummels you know mother told us not to forget them said beth ten days after mrs marchs departure  im too tired to go this afternoon replied meg rocking comfortably as she sewed  cant you jo asked beth  too stormy for me with my cold  i thought it was almost well  its well enough for me to go out with laurie but not well enough to go to the hummels said jo laughing but looking a little ashamed of her inconsistency  why dont you go yourself asked meg  i have been every day but the baby is sick and i dont know what to do for it mrs hummel goes away to work and lottchen takes care of it but it gets sicker and sicker and i think you or hannah ought to go  beth spoke earnestly and meg promised she would go tomorrow  ask hannah for some nice little mess and take it round beth the air will do you good said jo adding apologetically id go but i want to finish my writing  my head aches and im tired so i thought maybe some of you would go said beth  amy will be in presently and she will run down for us suggested meg  so beth lay down on the sofa the others returned to their work and the hummels were forgotten an hour passed amy did not come meg went to her room to try on a new dress jo was absorbed in her story and hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire when beth quietly put on her hood filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a grieved look in her patient eyes it was late when she came back and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her mothers room half an hour after jo went to mothers closet for something and there found little beth sitting on the medicine chest looking very grave with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand  christopher columbus whats the matter cried jo as beth put out her hand as if to warn her off and asked quickly    youve had the scarlet fever havent you  years ago when meg did why  then ill tell you oh jo the babys dead  what baby  mrs hummels it died in my lap before she got home cried beth with a sob  my poor dear how dreadful for you i ought to have gone said jo taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mothers big chair with a remorseful face  it wasnt dreadful jo only so sad i saw in a minute it was sicker but lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor so i took baby and let lotty rest it seemed asleep but all of a sudden if gave a little cry and trembled and then lay very still i tried to warm its feet and lotty gave it some milk but it didnt stir and i knew it was dead  dont cry dear what did you do  i just sat and held it softly till mrs hummel came with the doctor he said it was dead and looked at heinrich and minna who have sore throats scarlet fever maam ought to have called me before he said crossly mrs hummel told him she was poor and had tried to cure baby herself but now it was too late and she could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for his pay he smiled then and was kinder but it was very sad and i cried with them till he turned round all of a sudden and told me to go home and take belladonna right away or id have the fever  no you wont cried jo hugging her close with a frightened look oh beth if you should be sick i never could forgive myself what shall we do  dont be frightened i guess i shant have it badly i looked in mothers book and saw that it begins with headache sore throat and queer feelings like mine so i did take some belladonna and i feel better said beth laying her cold hands on her hot forehead and trying to look well  if mother was only at home exclaimed jo seizing the book and feeling that washington was an immense way off she read a page looked at beth felt her head peeped into her throat and then said gravely youve been over the baby every day for more than a week and among the others who are going to have it so im afraid you are going to have it beth ill call hannah she knows all about sickness  dont let amy come she never had it and i should hate to give it to her cant you and meg have it over again asked beth anxiously  i guess not dont care if i do serve me right selfish pig to let you go and stay writing rubbish myself muttered jo as she went to consult hannah  the good soul was wide awake in a minute and took the lead at once assuring that there was no need to worry every one had scarlet fever and if rightly treated nobody died all of which jo believed and felt much relieved as they went up to call meg  now ill tell you what well do said hannah when she had examined and questioned beth we will have dr bangs just to take a look at you dear and see that we start right then well send amy off to aunt marchs for a spell to keep her out of harms way and one of you girls can stay at home and amuse beth for a day or two  i shall stay of course im oldest began meg looking anxious and selfreproachful  i shall because its my fault she is sick i told mother id do the errands and i havent said jo decidedly  which will you have beth there aint no need of but one aid hannah  jo please and beth leaned her head against her sister with a contented look which effectually settled that point  ill go and tell amy said meg feeling a little hurt yet rather relieved on the whole for she did not like nursing and jo did  amy rebelled outright and passionately declared that she had rather have the fever than go to aunt march meg reasoned pleaded and commanded all in vain amy protested that she would not go and meg left her in despair to ask hannah what should be done before she came back laurie walked into the parlor to find amy sobbing with her head in the sofa cushions she told her story expecting to be consoled but laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room whistling softly as he knit his brows in deep thought presently he sat down beside her and said in his most wheedlesome tone now be a sensible little woman and do as they say no dont cry but hear what a jolly plan ive got you go to aunt marchs and ill come and take you out every day driving or walking and well have capital times wont that be better than moping here  i dont wish to be sent off as if i was in the way began amy in an injured voice  bless your heart child its to keep you well you dont want to be sick do you  no im sure i dont but i dare say i shall be for ive been with beth all the time  thats the very reason you ought to go away at once so that you may escape it change of air and care will keep you well i dare say or if it does not entirely you will have the fever more lightly i advise you to be off as soon as you can for scarlet fever is no joke miss  but its dull at aunt marchs and she is so cross said amy looking rather frightened  it wont be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how beth is and take you out gallivanting the old lady likes me and ill be as sweet as possible to her so she wont peck at us whatever we do  will you take me out in the trotting wagon with puck  on my honor as a gentleman  and come every single day  see if i dont  and bring me back the minute beth is well  the identical minute  and go to the theater truly  a dozen theaters if we may  welli guess i will said amy slowly  good girl call meg and tell her youll give in said laurie with an approving pat which annoyed amy more than the giving in  meg and jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been wrought and amy feeling very precious and selfsacrificing promised to go if the doctor said beth was going to be ill  how is the little dear asked laurie for beth was his especial pet and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show  she is lying down on mothers bed and feels better the babys death troubled her but i dare say she has only got cold hannah says she thinks so but she looks worried and that makes me fidgety answered meg  what a trying world it is said jo rumpling up her hair in a fretful way no sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another there doesnt seem to be anything to hold on to when mothers gone so im all at sea  well dont make a porcupine of yourself it isnt becoming settle your wig jo and tell me if i shall telegraph to your mother or do anything asked laurie who never had been reconciled to the loss of his friends one beauty  that is what troubles me said meg i think we ought to tell her if beth is really ill but hannah says we mustnt for mother cant leave father and it will only make them anxious beth wont be sick long and hannah knows just what to do and mother said we were to mind her so i suppose we must but it doesnt seem quite right to me  hum well i cant say suppose you ask grandfather after the doctor has been  we will jo go and get dr bangs at once commanded meg we cant decide anything till he has been  stay where you are jo im errand boy to this establishment said laurie taking up his cap  im afraid you are busy began meg  no ive done my lessons for the day  do you study in vacation time asked jo  i follow the good example my neighbors set me was lauries answer as he swung himself out of the room  i have great hopes for my boy observed jo watching him fly over the fence with an approving smile  he does very well for a boy was megs somewhat ungracious answer for the subject did not interest her  dr bangs came said beth had symptoms of the fever but he thought she would have it lightly though he looked sober over the hummel story amy was ordered off at once and provided with something to ward off danger she departed in great state with jo and laurie as escort  aunt march received them with her usual hospitality  what do you want now she asked looking sharply over her spectacles while the parrot sitting on the back of her chair called out  go away no boys allowed here  laurie retired to the window and jo told her story  no more than i expected if you are allowed to go poking about among poor folks amy can stay and make herself useful if she isnt sick which ive no doubt she will be looks like it now dont cry child it worries me to hear people sniff  amy was on the point of crying but laurie slyly pulled the parrots tail which caused polly to utter an astonished croak and call out bless my boots in such a funny way that she laughed instead  what do you hear from your mother asked the old lady gruffly  father is much better replied jo trying to keep sober  oh is he well that wont last long i fancy march never had any stamina was the cheerful reply  ha ha never say die take a pinch of snuff goodbye goodbye squalled polly dancing on her perch and clawing at the old ladys cap as laurie tweaked him in the rear  hold your tongue you disrespectful old bird and jo youd better go at once it isnt proper to be gadding about so late with a rattlepated boy like  hold your tongue you disrespectful old bird cried polly tumbling off the chair with a bounce and running to peck the rattlepated boy who was shaking with laughter at the last speech  i dont think i can bear it but ill try thought amy as she was left alone with aunt march  get along you fright screamed polly and at that rude speech amy could not restrain a sniff     chapter eighteen dark days   beth did have the fever and was much sicker than anyone but hannah and the doctor suspected the girls knew nothing about illness and mr laurence was not allowed to see her so hannah had everything her own way and busy dr bangs did his best but left a good deal to the excellent nurse meg stayed at home lest she should infect the kings and kept house feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote letters in which no mention was made of beths illness she could not think it right to deceive her mother but she had been bidden to mind hannah and hannah wouldnt hear of mrs march bein told and worried just for sech a trifle  jo devoted herself to beth day and night not a hard task for beth was very patient and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could control herself but there came a time when during the fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse broken voice to play on the coverlet as if on her beloved little piano and try to sing with a throat so swollen that there was no music left a time when she did not know the familiar faces around her but addressed them by wrong names and called imploringly for her mother then jo grew frightened meg begged to be allowed to write the truth and even hannah said she would think of it though there was no danger yet a letter from washington added to their trouble for mr march had had a relapse and could not think of coming home for a long while  how dark the days seemed now how sad and lonely the house and how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home then it was that margaret sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work felt how rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could buyin love protection peace and health the real blessings of life then it was that jo living in the darkened room with that suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of beths nature to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts and to acknowledge the worth of beths unselfish ambition to live for others and make home happy by that exercise of those simple virtues which all may possess and which all should love and value more than talent wealth or beauty and amy in her exile longed eagerly to be at home that she might work for beth feeling now that no service would be hard or irksome and remembering with regretful grief how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost and mr laurence locked the grand piano because he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him everyone missed beth the milkman baker grocer and butcher inquired how she did poor mrs hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to get a shroud for minna the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and good wishes and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many friends shy little beth had made  meanwhile she lay on her bed with old joanna at her side for even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege she longed for her cats but would not have them brought lest they should get sick and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about jo she sent loving messages to amy bade them tell her mother that she would write soon and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word that father might not think she had neglected him but soon even these intervals of consciousness ended and she lay hour after hour tossing to and fro with incoherent words on her lips or sank into a heavy sleep which brought her no refreshment dr bangs came twice a day hannah sat up at night meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute and jo never stirred from beths side  the first of december was a wintry day indeed to them for a bitter wind blew snow fell fast and the year seemed getting ready for its death when dr bangs came that morning he looked long at beth held the hot hand in both his own for a minute and laid it gently down saying in a low voice to hannah if mrs march can leave her husband shed better be sent for  hannah nodded without speaking for her lips twitched nervously meg dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs at the sound of those words and jo standing with a pale face for a minute ran to the parlor snatched up the telegram and throwing on her things rushed out into the storm she was soon back and while noiselessly taking off her cloak laurie came in with a letter saying that mr march was mending again jo read it thankfully but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her heart and her face was so full of misery that laurie asked quickly what is it is beth worse  ive sent for mother said jo tugging at her rubber boots with a tragic expression  good for you jo did you do it on your own responsibility asked laurie as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the rebellious boots seeing how her hands shook  no the doctor told us to  oh jo its not so bad as that cried laurie with a startled face  yes it is she doesnt know us she doesnt even talk about the flocks of green doves as she calls the vine leaves on the wall she doesnt look like my beth and theres nobody to help us bear it mother and father both gone and god seems so far away i cant find him  as the tears streamed fast down poor jos cheeks she stretched out her hand in a helpless sort of way as if groping in the dark and laurie took it in his whispering as well as he could with a lump in his throat im here hold on to me jo dear  she could not speak but she did hold on and the warm grasp of the friendly human hand comforted her sore heart and seemed to lead her nearer to the divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble  laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable but no fitting words came to him so he stood silent gently stroking her bent head as her mother used to do it was the best thing he could have done far more soothing than the most eloquent words for jo felt the unspoken sympathy and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection administers to sorrow soon she dried the tears which had relieved her and looked up with a grateful face  thank you teddy im better now i dont feel so forlorn and will try to bear it if it comes  keep hoping for the best that will help you jo soon your mother will be here and then everything will be all right  im so glad father is better now she wont feel so bad about leaving him oh me it does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap and i got the heaviest part on my shoulders sighed jo spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry  doesnt meg pull fair asked laurie looking indignant  oh yes she tries to but she cant love bethy as i do and she wont miss her as i shall beth is my conscience and i cant give her up i cant i cant  down went jos face into the wet handkerchief and she cried despairingly for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a tear laurie drew his hand across his eyes but could not speak till he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips it might be unmanly but he couldnt help it and i am glad of it presently as jos sobs quieted he said hopefully i dont think she will die shes so good and we all love her so much i dont believe god will take her away yet  the good and dear people always do die groaned jo but she stopped crying for her friends words cheered her up in spite of her own doubts and fears  poor girl youre worn out it isnt like you to be forlorn stop a bit ill hearten you up in a jiffy  laurie went off two stairs at a time and jo laid her wearied head down on beths little brown hood which no one had thought of moving from the table where she left it it must have possessed some magic for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into jo and when laurie came running down with a glass of wine she took it with a smile and said bravely i drink health to my beth you are a good doctor teddy and such a comfortable friend how can i ever pay you she added as the wine refreshed her body as the kind words had done her troubled mind  ill send my bill byandby and tonight ill give you something that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine said laurie beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at something  what is it cried jo forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder  i telegraphed to your mother yesterday and brooke answered shed come at once and shell be here tonight and everything will be all right arent you glad i did it  laurie spoke very fast and turned red and excited all in a minute for he had kept his plot a secret for fear of disappointing the girls or harming beth jo grew quite white flew out of her chair and the moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms round his neck and crying out with a joyful cry oh laurie oh mother i am so glad she did not weep again but laughed hysterically and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden news  laurie though decidedly amazed behaved with great presence of mind he patted her back soothingly and finding that she was recovering followed it up by a bashful kiss or two which brought jo round at once holding on to the banisters she put him gently away saying breathlessly oh dont i didnt mean to it was dreadful of me but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of hannah that i couldnt help flying at you tell me all about it and dont give me wine again it makes me act so  i dont mind laughed laurie as he settled his tie why you see i got fidgety and so did grandpa we thought hannah was overdoing the authority business and your mother ought to know shed never forgive us if beth well if anything happened you know so i got grandpa to say it was high time we did something and off i pelted to the office yesterday for the doctor looked sober and hannah most took my head off when i proposed a telegram i never can bear to be lorded over so that settled my mind and i did it your mother will come i know and the late train is in at two am i shall go for her and youve only got to bottle up your rapture and keep beth quiet till that blessed lady gets here  laurie youre an angel how shall i ever thank you  fly at me again i rather liked it said laurie looking mischievous a thing he had not done for a fortnight  no thank you ill do it by proxy when your grandpa comes dont tease but go home and rest for youll be up half the night bless you teddy bless you  jo had backed into a corner and as she finished her speech she vanished precipitately into the kitchen where she sat down upon a dresser and told the assembled cats that she was happy oh so happy while laurie departed feeling that he had made a rather neat thing of it  thats the interferingest chap i ever see but i forgive him and do hope mrs march is coming right away said hannah with an air of relief when jo told the good news  meg had a quiet rapture and then brooded over the letter while jo set the sickroom in order and hannah knocked up a couple of pies in case of company unexpected a breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the house and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms everything appeared to feel the hopeful change beths bird began to chirp again and a halfblown rose was discovered on amys bush in the window the fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness and every time the girls met their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one another whispering encouragingly mothers coming dear mothers coming every one rejoiced but beth she lay in that heavy stupor alike unconscious of hope and joy doubt and danger it was a piteous sight the once rosy face so changed and vacant the once busy hands so weak and wasted the once smiling lips quite dumb and the once pretty wellkept hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow all day she lay so only rousing now and then to mutter water with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word all day jo and meg hovered over her watching waiting hoping and trusting in god and mother and all day the snow fell the bitter wind raged and the hours dragged slowly by but night came at last and every time the clock struck the sisters still sitting on either side of the bed looked at each other with brightening eyes for each hour brought help nearer the doctor had been in to say that some change for better or worse would probably take place about midnight at which time he would return  hannah quite worn out lay down on the sofa at the beds foot and fell fast asleep mr laurence marched to and fro in the parlor feeling that he would rather face a rebel battery than mrs marchs countenance as she entered laurie lay on the rug pretending to rest but staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear  the girls never forgot that night for no sleep came to them as they kept their watch with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those  if god spares beth i never will complain again whispered meg earnestly  if god spares beth ill try to love and serve him all my life answered jo with equal fervor  i wish i had no heart it aches so sighed meg after a pause  if life is often as hard as this i dont see how we ever shall get through it added her sister despondently  here the clock struck twelve and both forgot themselves in watching beth for they fancied a change passed over her wan face the house was still as death and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep hush weary hannah slept on and no one but the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed an hour went by and nothing happened except lauries quiet departure for the station another hour still no one came and anxious fears of delay in the storm or accidents by the way or worst of all a great grief at washington haunted the girls  it was past two when jo who stood at the window thinking how dreary the world looked in its winding sheet of snow heard a movement by the bed and turning quickly saw meg kneeling before their mothers easy chair with her face hidden a dreadful fear passed coldly over jo as she thought beth is dead and meg is afraid to tell me  she was back at her post in an instant and to her excited eyes a great change seemed to have taken place the fever flush and the look of pain were gone and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in its utter repose that jo felt no desire to weep or to lament leaning low over this dearest of her sisters she kissed the damp forehead with her heart on her lips and softly whispered goodby my beth goodby  as if awaked by the stir hannah started out of her sleep hurried to the bed looked at beth felt her hands listened at her lips and then throwing her apron over her head sat down to rock to and fro exclaiming under her breath the fevers turned shes sleepin natral her skins damp and she breathes easy praise be given oh my goodness me  before the girls could believe the happy truth the doctor came to confirm it he was a homely man but they thought his face quite heavenly when he smiled and said with a fatherly look at them yes my dears i think the little girl will pull through this time keep the house quiet let her sleep and when she wakes give her  what they were to give neither heard for both crept into the dark hall and sitting on the stairs held each other close rejoicing with hearts too full for words when they went back to be kissed and cuddled by faithful hannah they found beth lying as she used to do with her cheek pillowed on her hand the dreadful pallor gone and breathing quietly as if just fallen asleep  if mother would only come now said jo as the winter night began to wane  see said meg coming up with a white halfopened rose i thought this would hardly be ready to lay in beths hand tomorrow if shewent away from us but it has blossomed in the night and now i mean to put it in my vase here so that when the darling wakes the first thing she sees will be the little rose and mothers face  never had the sun risen so beautifully and never had the world seemed so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of meg and jo as they looked out in the early morning when their long sad vigil was done  it looks like a fairy world said meg smiling to herself as she stood behind the curtain watching the dazzling sight  hark cried jo starting to her feet  yes there was a sound of bells at the door below a cry from hannah and then lauries voice saying in a joyful whisper girls shes come shes come     chapter nineteen amys will   while these things were happening at home amy was having hard times at aunt marchs she felt her exile deeply and for the first time in her life realized how much she was beloved and petted at home aunt march never petted any one she did not approve of it but she meant to be kind for the wellbehaved little girl pleased her very much and aunt march had a soft place in her old heart for her nephews children though she didnt think it proper to confess it she really did her best to make amy happy but dear me what mistakes she made some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs can sympathize with childrens little cares and joys make them feel at home and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way but aunt march had not this gift and she worried amy very much with her rules and orders her prim ways and long prosy talks finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract as far as possible the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence so she took amy by the hand and taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago a process which carried dismay to amys soul and made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider  she had to wash the cups every morning and polish up the oldfashioned spoons the fat silver teapot and the glasses till they shone then she must dust the room and what a trying job that was not a speck escaped aunt marchs eye and all the furniture had claw legs and much carving which was never dusted to suit then polly had to be fed the lap dog combed and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or deliver orders for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big chair after these tiresome labors she must do her lessons which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed then she was allowed one hour for exercise or play and didnt she enjoy it  laurie came every day and wheedled aunt march till amy was allowed to go out with him when they walked and rode and had capital times after dinner she had to read aloud and sit still while the old lady slept which she usually did for an hour as she dropped off over the first page then patchwork or towels appeared and amy sewed with outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked till teatime the evenings were the worst of all for aunt march fell to telling long stories about her youth which were so unutterably dull that amy was always ready to go to bed intending to cry over her hard fate but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two  if it had not been for laurie and old esther the maid she felt that she never could have got through that dreadful time the parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted for he soon felt that she did not admire him and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible he pulled her hair whenever she came near him upset his bread and milk to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage made mop bark by pecking at him while madam dozed called her names before company and behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird then she could not endure the dog a fat cross beast who snarled and yelped at her when she made his toilet and who lay on his back with all his legs in the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to eat which was about a dozen times a day the cook was badtempered the old coachman was deaf and esther the only one who ever took any notice of the young lady  esther was a frenchwoman who had lived with madame as she called her mistress for many years and who rather tyrannized over the old lady who could not get along without her her real name was estelle but aunt march ordered her to change it and she obeyed on condition that she was never asked to change her religion she took a fancy to mademoiselle and amused her very much with odd stories of her life in france when amy sat with her while she got up madames laces she also allowed her to roam about the great house and examine the curious and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests for aunt march hoarded like a magpie amys chief delight was an indian cabinet full of queer drawers little pigeonholes and secret places in which were kept all sorts of ornaments some precious some merely curious all more or less antique to examine and arrange these things gave amy great satisfaction especially the jewel cases in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty years ago there was the garnet set which aunt march wore when she came out the pearls her father gave her on her wedding day her lovers diamonds the jet mourning rings and pins the queer lockets with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn uncle marchs big watch with the red seal so many childish hands had played with and in a box all by itself lay aunt marchs wedding ring too small now for her fat finger but put carefully away like the most precious jewel of them all  which would mademoiselle choose if she had her will asked esther who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables  i like the diamonds best but there is no necklace among them and im fond of necklaces they are so becoming i should choose this if i might replied amy looking with great admiration at a string of gold and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same  i too covet that but not as a necklace ah no to me it is a rosary and as such i should use it like a good catholic said esther eyeing the handsome thing wistfully  is it meant to use as you use the string of goodsmelling wooden beads hanging over your glass asked amy  truly yes to pray with it would be pleasing to the saints if one used so fine a rosary as this instead of wearing it as a vain bijou  you seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers esther and always come down looking quiet and satisfied i wish i could  if mademoiselle was a catholic she would find true comfort but as that is not to be it would be well if you went apart each day to meditate and pray as did the good mistress whom i served before madame she had a little chapel and in it found solacement for much trouble  would it be right for me to do so too asked amy who in her loneliness felt the need of help of some sort and found that she was apt to forget her little book now that beth was not there to remind her of it  it would be excellent and charming and i shall gladly arrange the little dressing room for you if you like it say nothing to madame but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts and pray the dear god preserve your sister  esther was truly pious and quite sincere in her advice for she had an affectionate heart and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety amy liked the idea and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her room hoping it would do her good  i wish i knew where all these pretty things would go when aunt march dies she said as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the jewel cases one by one  to you and your sisters i know it madame confides in me i witnessed her will and it is to be so whispered esther smiling  how nice but i wish shed let us have them now procrastination is not agreeable observed amy taking a last look at the diamonds  it is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things the first one who is affianced will have the pearls madame has said it and i have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you when you go for madame approves your good behavior and charming manners  do you think so oh ill be a lamb if i can only have that lovely ring its ever so much prettier than kitty bryants i do like aunt march after all and amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it  from that day she was a model of obedience and the old lady complacently admired the success of her training esther fitted up the closet with a little table placed a footstool before it and over it a picture taken from one of the shutup rooms she thought it was of no great value but being appropriate she borrowed it well knowing that madame would never know it nor care if she did it was however a very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world and amys beautyloving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet face of the divine mother while her tender thoughts of her own were busy at her heart on the table she laid her little testament and hymnbook kept a vase always full of the best flowers laurie brought her and came every day to sit alone thinking good thoughts and praying the dear god to preserve her sister esther had given her a rosary of black beads with a silver cross but amy hung it up and did not use it feeling doubtful as to its fitness for protestant prayers  the little girl was very sincere in all this for being left alone outside the safe home nest she felt the need of some kind hand to hold by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender friend whose fatherly love most closely surrounds his little children she missed her mothers help to understand and rule herself but having been taught where to look she did her best to find the way and walk in it confidingly but amy was a young pilgrim and just now her burden seemed very heavy she tried to forget herself to keep cheerful and be satisfied with doing right though no one saw or praised her for it in her first effort at being very very good she decided to make her will as aunt march had done so that if she did fall ill and die her possessions might be justly and generously divided it cost her a pang even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were as precious as the old ladys jewels  during one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as well as she could with some help from esther as to certain legal terms and when the goodnatured frenchwoman had signed her name amy felt relieved and laid it by to show laurie whom she wanted as a second witness as it was a rainy day she went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large chambers and took polly with her for company in this room there was a wardrobe full of oldfashioned costumes with which esther allowed her to play and it was her favorite amusement to array herself in the faded brocades and parade up and down before the long mirror making stately curtsies and sweeping her train about with a rustle which delighted her ears so busy was she on this day that she did not hear lauries ring nor see his face peeping in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro flirting her fan and tossing her head on which she wore a great pink turban contrasting oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat she was obliged to walk carefully for she had on highheeled shoes and as laurie told jo afterward it was a comical sight to see her mince along in her gay suit with polly sidling and bridling just behind her imitating her as well as he could and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim aint we fine get along you fright hold your tongue kiss me dear ha ha  having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment lest it should offend her majesty laurie tapped and was graciously received  sit down and rest while i put these things away then i want to consult you about a very serious matter said amy when she had shown her splendor and driven polly into a corner that bird is the trial of my life she continued removing the pink mountain from her head while laurie seated himself astride a chair  yesterday when aunt was asleep and i was trying to be as still as a mouse polly began to squall and flap about in his cage so i went to let him out and found a big spider there i poked it out and it ran under the bookcase polly marched straight after it stooped down and peeped under the bookcase saying in his funny way with a cock of his eye come out and take a walk my dear i couldnt help laughing which made poll swear and aunt woke up and scolded us both  did the spider accept the old fellows invitation asked laurie yawning  yes out it came and away ran polly frightened to death and scrambled up on aunts chair calling out catch her catch her catch her as i chased the spider  thats a lie oh lor cried the parrot pecking at lauries toes  id wring your neck if you were mine you old torment cried laurie shaking his fist at the bird who put his head on one side and gravely croaked allyluyer bless your buttons dear  now im ready said amy shutting the wardrobe and taking a piece of paper out of her pocket i want you to read that please and tell me if it is legal and right i felt i ought to do it for life is uncertain and i dont want any ill feeling over my tomb  laurie bit his lips and turning a little from the pensive speaker read the following document with praiseworthy gravity considering the spelling   my last will and testiment   i amy curtis march being in my sane mind go give and bequeethe all my earthly propertyviz to wit namely   to my father my

20th day of nov anni domino 1861   amy curtis march   witnesses    estelle valnor theodore laurence   the last name was written in pencil and amy explained that he was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly  what put it into your head did anyone tell you about beths giving away her things asked laurie soberly as amy laid a bit of red tape with sealing wax a taper and a standish before him  she explained and then asked anxiously what about beth  im sorry i spoke but as i did ill tell you she felt so ill one day that she told jo she wanted to give her piano to meg her cats to you and the poor old doll to jo who would love it for her sake she was sorry she had so little to give and left locks of hair to the rest of us and her best love to grandpa she never thought of a will  laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke and did not look up till a great tear dropped on the paper amys face was full of trouble but she only said dont people put sort of postscripts to their wills sometimes  yes codicils they call them  put one in mine then that i wish all my curls cut off and given round to my friends i forgot it but i want it done though it will spoil my looks  laurie added it smiling at amys last and greatest sacrifice then he amused her for an hour and was much interested in all her trials but when he came to go amy held him back to whisper with trembling lips is there really any danger about beth  im afraid there is but we must hope for the best so dont cry dear and laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which was very comforting  when he had gone she went to her little chapel and sitting in the twilight prayed for beth with streaming tears and an aching heart feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the loss of her gentle little sister     chapter twenty confidential   i dont think i have any words in which to tell the meeting of the mother and daughters such hours are beautiful to live but very hard to describe so i will leave it to the imagination of my readers merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness and that megs tender hope was realized for when beth woke from that long healing sleep the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little rose and mothers face too weak to wonder at anything she only smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last then she slept again and the girls waited upon their mother for she would not unclasp the thin hand which clung to hers even in sleep  hannah had dished up an astonishing breakfast for the traveler finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way and meg and jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks while they listened to her whispered account of fathers state mr brookes promise to stay and nurse him the delays which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey and the unspeakable comfort lauries hopeful face had given her when she arrived worn out with fatigue anxiety and cold  what a strange yet pleasant day that was so brilliant and gay without for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow so quiet and reposeful within for everyone slept spent with watching and a sabbath stillness reigned through the house while nodding hannah mounted guard at the door with a blissful sense of burdens lifted off meg and jo closed their weary eyes and lay at rest like stormbeaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor mrs march would not leave beths side but rested in the big chair waking often to look at touch and brood over her child like a miser over some recovered treasure  laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort amy and told his story so well that aunt march actually sniffed herself and never once said i told you so amy came out so strong on this occasion that i think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit she dried her tears quickly restrained her impatience to see her mother and never even thought of the turquoise ring when the old lady heartily agreed in lauries opinion that she behaved like a capital little woman even polly seemed impressed for he called her a good girl blessed her buttons and begged her to come and take a walk dear in his most affable tone she would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright wintry weather but discovering that laurie was dropping with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact she persuaded him to rest on the sofa while she wrote a note to her mother she was a long time about it and when she returned he was stretched out with both arms under his head sound asleep while aunt march had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity  after a while they began to think he was not going to wake up till night and im not sure that he would had he not been effectually roused by amys cry of joy at sight of her mother there probably were a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day but it is my private opinion that amy was the happiest of all when she sat in her mothers lap and told her trials receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses they were alone together in the chapel to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her  on the contrary i like it very much dear looking from the dusty rosary to the wellworn little book and the lovely picture with its garland of evergreen it is an excellent plan to have some place where we can go to be quiet when things vex or grieve us there are a good many hard times in this life of ours but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way i think my little girl is learning this  yes mother and when i go home i mean to have a corner in the big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which ive tried to make the womans face is not good its too beautiful for me to draw but the baby is done better and i love it very much i like to think he was a little child once for then i dont seem so far away and that helps me  as amy pointed to the smiling christ child on his mothers knee mrs march saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile she said nothing but amy understood the look and after a minutes pause she added gravely i wanted to speak to you about this but i forgot it aunt gave me the ring today she called me to her and kissed me and put it on my finger and said i was a credit to her and shed like to keep me always she gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on as its too big id like to wear them mother can i  they are very pretty but i think youre rather too young for such ornaments amy said mrs march looking at the plump little hand with the band of skyblue stones on the forefinger and the quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together  ill try not to be vain said amy i dont think i like it only because its so pretty but i want to wear it as the girl in the story wore her bracelet to remind me of something  do you mean aunt march asked her mother laughing  no to remind me not to be selfish amy looked so earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing and listened respectfully to the little plan  ive thought a great deal lately about my bundle of naughties and being selfish is the largest one in it so im going to try hard to cure it if i can beth isnt selfish and thats the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her people wouldnt feel so bad about me if i was sick and i dont deserve to have them but id like to be loved and missed by a great many friends so im going to try and be like beth all i can im apt to forget my resolutions but if i had something always about me to remind me i guess i should do better may we try this way  yes but i have more faith in the corner of the big closet wear your ring dear and do your best i think you will prosper for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle now i must go back to beth keep up your heart little daughter and we will soon have you home again  that evening while meg was writing to her father to report the travelers safe arrival jo slipped upstairs into beths room and finding her mother in her usual place stood a minute twisting her fingers in her hair with a worried gesture and an undecided look  what is it deary asked mrs march holding out her hand with a face which invited confidence  i want to tell you something mother  about meg  how quickly you guessed yes its about her and though its a little thing it fidgets me  beth is asleep speak low and tell me all about it that moffat hasnt been here i hope asked mrs march rather sharply  no i should have shut the door in his face if he had said jo settling herself on the floor at her mothers feet last summer meg left a pair of gloves over at the laurences and only one was returned we forgot about it till teddy told me that mr brooke owned that he liked meg but didnt dare say so she was so young and he so poor now isnt it a dreadful state of things  do you think meg cares for him asked mrs march with an anxious look  mercy me i dont know anything about love and such nonsense cried jo with a funny mixture of interest and contempt in novels the girls show it by starting and blushing fainting away growing thin and acting like fools now meg does not do anything of the sort she eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature she looks straight in my face when i talk about that man and only blushes a little bit when teddy jokes about lovers i forbid him to do it but he doesnt mind me as he ought  then you fancy that meg is not interested in john  who cried jo staring  mr brooke i call him john now we fell into the way of doing so at the hospital and he likes it  oh dear i know youll take his part hes been good to father and you wont send him away but let meg marry him if she wants to mean thing to go petting papa and helping you just to wheedle you into liking him and jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak  my dear dont get angry about it and i will tell you how it happened john went with me at mr laurences request and was so devoted to poor father that we couldnt help getting fond of him he was perfectly open and honorable about meg for he told us he loved her but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him he only wanted our leave to love her and work for her and the right to make her love him if he could he is a truly excellent young man and we could not refuse to listen to him but i will not consent to megs engaging herself so young  of course not it would be idiotic i knew there was mischief brewing i felt it and now its worse than i imagined i just wish i could marry meg myself and keep her safe in the family  this odd arrangement made mrs march smile but she said gravely jo i confide in you and dont wish you to say anything to meg yet when john comes back and i see them together i can judge better of her feelings toward him  shell see those handsome eyes that she talks about and then it will be all up with her shes got such a soft heart it will melt like butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her she read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters and pinched me when i spoke of it and likes brown eyes and doesnt think john an ugly name and shell go and fall in love and theres an end of peace and fun and cozy times together i see it all theyll go lovering around the house and we shall have to dodge meg will be absorbed and no good to me any more brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow carry her off and make a hole in the family and i shall break my heart and everything will be abominably uncomfortable oh dear me why werent we all boys then there wouldnt be any bother  jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook her fist at the reprehensible john mrs march sighed and jo looked up with an air of relief  you dont like it mother im glad of it lets send him about his business and not tell meg a word of it but all be happy together as we always have been  i did wrong to sigh jo it is natural and right you should all go to homes of your own in time but i do want to keep my girls as long as i can and i am sorry that this happened so soon for meg is only seventeen and it will be some years before john can make a home for her your father and i have agreed that she shall not bind herself in any way nor be married before twenty if she and john love one another they can wait and test the love by doing so she is conscientious and i have no fear of her treating him unkindly my pretty tender hearted girl i hope things will go happily with her  hadnt you rather have her marry a rich man asked jo as her mothers voice faltered a little over the last words  money is a good and useful thing jo and i hope my girls will never feel the need of it too bitterly nor be tempted by too much i should like to know that john was firmly established in some good business which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make meg comfortable im not ambitious for a splendid fortune a fashionable position or a great name for my girls if rank and money come with love and virtue also i should accept them gratefully and enjoy your good fortune but i know by experience how much genuine happiness can be had in a plain little house where the daily bread is earned and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures i am content to see meg begin humbly for if i am not mistaken she will be rich in the possession of a good mans heart and that is better than a fortune  i understand mother and quite agree but im disappointed about meg for id planned to have her marry teddy byandby and sit in the lap of luxury all her days wouldnt it be nice asked jo looking up with a brighter face  he is younger than she you know began mrs march but jo broke in  only a little hes old for his age and tall and can be quite grownup in his manners if he likes then hes rich and generous and good and loves us all and i say its a pity my plan is spoiled  im afraid laurie is hardly grownup enough for meg and altogether too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to depend on dont make plans jo but let time and their own hearts mate your friends we cant meddle safely in such matters and had better not get romantic rubbish as you call it into our heads lest it spoil our friendship  well i wont but i hate to see things going all crisscross and getting snarled up when a pull here and a snip there would straighten it out i wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from growing up but buds will be roses and kittens cats mores the pity  whats that about flatirons and cats asked meg as she crept into the room with the finished letter in her hand  only one of my stupid speeches im going to bed come peggy said jo unfolding herself like an animated puzzle  quite right and beautifully written please add that i send my love to john said mrs march as she glanced over the letter and gave it back  do you call him john asked meg smiling with her innocent eyes looking down into her mothers  yes he has been like a son to us and we are very fond of him replied mrs march returning the look with a keen one  im glad of that he is so lonely good night mother dear it is so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here was megs answer  the kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one and as she went away mrs march said with a mixture of satisfaction and regret she does not love john yet but will soon learn to     chapter twentyone laurie makes mischief and jo makes peace   jos face was a study next day for the secret rather weighed upon her and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important meg observed it but did not trouble herself to make inquiries for she had learned that the best way to manage jo was by the law of contraries so she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask she was rather surprised therefore when the silence remained unbroken and jo assumed a patronizing air which decidedly aggravated meg who in turn assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother this left jo to her own devices for mrs march had taken her place as nurse and bade her rest exercise and amuse herself after her long confinement amy being gone laurie was her only refuge and much as she enjoyed his society she rather dreaded him just then for he was an incorrigible tease and she feared he would coax the secret from her  she was quite right for the mischiefloving lad no sooner suspected a mystery than he set himself to find it out and led jo a trying life of it he wheedled bribed ridiculed threatened and scolded affected indifference that he might surprise the truth from her declared he knew then that he didnt care and at last by dint of perseverance he satisfied himself that it concerned meg and mr brooke feeling indignant that he was not taken into his tutors confidence he set his wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight  meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in preparations for her fathers return but all of a sudden a change seemed to come over her and for a day or two she was quite unlike herself she started when spoken to blushed when looked at was very quiet and sat over her sewing with a timid troubled look on her face to her mothers inquiries she answered that she was quite well and jos she silenced by begging to be let alone  she feels it in the airlove i meanand shes going very fast shes got most of the symptomsis twittery and cross doesnt eat lies awake and mopes in corners i caught her singing that song he gave her and once she said john as you do and then turned as red as a poppy whatever shall we do said jo looking ready for any measures however violent  nothing but wait let her alone be kind and patient and fathers coming will settle everything replied her mother  heres a note to you meg all sealed up how odd teddy never seals mine said jo next day as she distributed the contents of the little post office  mrs march and jo were deep in their own affairs when a sound from meg made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face  my child what is it cried her mother running to her while jo tried to take the paper which had done the mischief  its all a mistake he didnt send it oh jo how could you do it and meg hid her face in her hands crying as if her heart were quite broken  me ive done nothing whats she talking about cried jo bewildered  megs mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from her pocket and threw it at jo saying reproachfully you wrote it and that bad boy helped you how could you be so rude so mean and cruel to us both  jo hardly heard her for she and her mother were reading the note which was written in a peculiar hand  my dearest margaret   i can no longer restrain my passion and must know my fate before i return i dare not tell your parents yet but i think they would consent if they knew that we adored one another mr laurence will help me to some good place and then my sweet girl you will make me happy i implore you to say nothing to your family yet but to send one word of hope through laurie to   your devoted john   oh the little villain thats the way he meant to pay me for keeping my word to mother ill give him a hearty scolding and bring him over to beg pardon cried jo burning to execute immediate justice but her mother held her back saying with a look she seldom wore  stop jo you must clear yourself first you have played so many pranks that i am afraid you have had a hand in this  on my word mother i havent i never saw that note before and dont know anything about it as true as i live said jo so earnestly that they believed her if i had taken part in it id have done it better than this and have written a sensible note i should think youd have known mr brooke wouldnt write such stuff as that she added scornfully tossing down the paper  its like his writing faltered meg comparing it with the note in her hand  oh meg you didnt answer it cried mrs march quickly  yes i did and meg hid her face again overcome with shame  heres a scrape do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and be lectured i cant rest till i get hold of him and jo made for the door again  hush let me handle this for it is worse than i thought margaret tell me the whole story commanded mrs march sitting down by meg yet keeping hold of jo lest she should fly off  i received the first letter from laurie who didnt look as if he knew anything about it began meg without looking up i was worried at first and meant to tell you then i remembered how you liked mr brooke so i thought you wouldnt mind if i kept my little secret for a few days im so silly that i liked to think no one knew and while i was deciding what to say i felt like the girls in books who have such things to do forgive me mother im paid for my silliness now i never can look him in the face again  what did you say to him asked mrs march  i only said i was too young to do anything about it yet that i didnt wish to have secrets from you and he must speak to father i was very grateful for his kindness and would be his friend but nothing more for a long while  mrs march smiled as if well pleased and jo clapped her hands exclaiming with a laugh you are almost equal to caroline percy who was a pattern of prudence tell on meg what did he say to that  he writes in a different way entirely telling me that he never sent any love letter at all and is very sorry that my roguish sister jo should take liberties with our names its very kind and respectful but think how dreadful for me  meg leaned against her mother looking the image of despair and jo tramped about the room calling laurie names all of a sudden she stopped caught up the two notes and after looking at them closely said decidedly i dont believe brooke ever saw either of these letters teddy wrote both and keeps yours to crow over me with because i wouldnt tell him my secret  dont have any secrets jo tell it to mother and keep out of trouble as i should have done said meg warningly  bless you child mother told me  that will do jo ill comfort meg while you go and get laurie i shall sift the matter to the bottom and put a stop to such pranks at once  away ran jo and mrs march gently told meg mr brookes real feelings now dear what are your own do you love him enough to wait till he can make a home for you or will you keep yourself quite free for the present  ive been so scared and worried i dont want to have anything to do with lovers for a long while perhaps never answered meg petulantly if john doesnt know anything about this nonsense dont tell him and make jo and laurie hold their tongues i wont be deceived and plagued and made a fool of its a shame  seeing megs usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by this mischievous joke mrs march soothed her by promises of entire silence and great discretion for the future the instant lauries step was heard in the hall meg fled into the study and mrs march received the culprit alone jo had not told him why he was wanted fearing he wouldnt come but he knew the minute he saw mrs marchs face and stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once jo was dismissed but chose to march up and down the hall like a sentinel having some fear that the prisoner might bolt the sound of voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour but what happened during that interview the girls never knew  when they were called in laurie was standing by their mother with such a penitent face that jo forgave him on the spot but did not think it wise to betray the fact meg received his humble apology and was much comforted by the assurance that brooke knew nothing of the joke  ill never tell him to my dying day wild horses shant drag it out of me so youll forgive me meg and ill do anything to show how outandout sorry i am he added looking very much ashamed of himself  ill try but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do i didnt think you could be so sly and malicious laurie replied meg trying to hide her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air  it was altogether abominable and i dont deserve to be spoken to for a month but you will though wont you and laurie folded his hands together with such and imploring gesture as he spoke in his irresistibly persuasive tone that it was impossible to frown upon him in spite of his scandalous behavior  meg pardoned him and mrs marchs grave face relaxed in spite of her efforts to keep sober when she heard him declare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances and abase himself like a worm before the injured damsel  jo stood aloof meanwhile trying to harden her heart against him and succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire disapprobation laurie looked at her once or twice but as she showed no sign of relenting he felt injured and turned his back on her till the others were done with him when he made her a low bow and walked off without a word  as soon as he had gone she wished she had been more forgiving and when meg and her mother went upstairs she felt lonely and longed for teddy after resisting for some time she yielded to the impulse and armed with a book to return went over to the big house  is mr laurence in asked jo of a housemaid who was coming downstairs  yes miss but i dont believe hes seeable just yet  why not is he ill  la no miss but hes had a scene with mr laurie who is in one of his tantrums about something which vexes the old gentleman so i dursnt go nigh him  where is laurie  shut up in his room and he wont answer though ive been atapping i dont know whats to become of the dinner for its ready and theres no one to eat it  ill go and see what the matter is im not afraid of either of them  up went jo and knocked smartly on the door of lauries little study  stop that or ill open the door and make you called out the young gentleman in a threatening tone  jo immediately knocked again the door flew open and in she bounced before laurie could recover from his surprise seeing that he really was out of temper jo who knew how to manage him assumed a contrite expression and going artistically down upon her knees said meekly please forgive me for being so cross i came to make it up and cant go away till i have  its all right get up and dont be a goose jo was the cavalier reply to her petition  thank you i will could i ask whats the matter you dont look exactly easy in your mind  ive been shaken and i wont bear it growled laurie indignantly  who did it demanded jo  grandfather if it had been anyone else id have and the injured youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm  thats nothing i often shake you and you dont mind said jo soothingly  pooh youre a girl and its fun but ill allow no man to shake me  i dont think anyone would care to try it if you looked as much like a thundercloud as you do now why were you treated so  just because i wouldnt say what your mother wanted me for id promised not to tell and of course i wasnt going to break my word  couldnt you satisfy your grandpa in any other way  no he would have the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth id have told my part of the scrape if i could without bringing meg in as i couldnt i held my tongue and bore the scolding till the old gentleman collared me then i bolted for fear i should forget myself  it wasnt nice but hes sorry i know so go down and make up ill help you  hanged if i do im not going to be lectured and pummelled by everyone just for a bit of a frolic i was sorry about meg and begged pardon like a man but i wont do it again when i wasnt in the wrong  he didnt know that  he ought to trust me and not act as if i was a baby its no use jo hes got to learn that im able to take care of myself and dont need anyones apron string to hold on by  what pepper pots you are sighed jo how do you mean to settle this affair  well he ought to beg pardon and believe me when i say i cant tell him what the fusss about  bless you he wont do that  i wont go down till he does  now teddy be sensible let it pass and ill explain what i can you cant stay here so whats the use of being melodramatic  i dont intend to stay here long anyway ill slip off and take a journey somewhere and when grandpa misses me hell come round fast enough  i dare say but you ought not to go and worry him  dont preach ill go to washington and see brooke its gay there and ill enjoy myself after the troubles  what fun youd have i wish i could run off too said jo forgetting her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital  come on then why not you go and surprise your father and ill stir up old brooke it would be a glorious joke lets do it jo well leave a letter saying we are all right and trot off at once ive got money enough it will do you good and no harm as you go to your father  for a moment jo looked as if she would agree for wild as the plan was it just suited her she was tired of care and confinement longed for change and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel charms of camps and hospitals liberty and fun her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully toward the window but they fell on the old house opposite and she shook her head with sorrowful decision  if i was a boy wed run away together and have a capital time but as im a miserable girl i must be proper and stop at home dont tempt me teddy its a crazy plan  thats the fun of it began laurie who had got a willful fit on him and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way  hold your tongue cried jo covering her ears prunes and prisms are my doom and i may as well make up my mind to it i came here to moralize not to hear things that make me skip to think of  i know meg would wetblanket such a proposal but i thought you had more spirit began laurie insinuatingly  bad boy be quiet sit down and think of your own sins dont go making me add to mine if i get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking will you give up running away asked jo seriously  yes but you wont do it answered laurie who wished to make up but felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first  if i can manage the young one i can the old one muttered jo as she walked away leaving laurie bent over a railroad map with his head propped up on both hands  come in and mr laurences gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever as jo tapped at his door  its only me sir come to return a book she said blandly as she entered  want any more asked the old gentleman looking grim and vexed but trying not to show it  yes please i like old sam so well i think ill try the second volume returned jo hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second dose of boswells johnson as he had recommended that lively work  the shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward the shelf where the johnsonian literature was placed jo skipped up and sitting on the top step affected to be searching for her book but was really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her visit mr laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in her mind for after taking several brisk turns about the room he faced round on her speaking so abruptly that rasselas tumbled face downward on the floor  what has that boy been about dont try to shield him i know he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home i cant get a word from him and when i threatened to shake the truth out of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself into his room  he did wrong but we forgave him and all promised not to say a word to anyone began jo reluctantly  that wont do he shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you softhearted girls if hes done anything amiss he shall confess beg pardon and be punished out with it jo i wont be kept in the dark  mr laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that jo would have gladly run away if she could but she was perched aloft on the steps and he stood at the foot a lion in the path so she had to stay and brave it out  indeed sir i cannot tell mother forbade it laurie has confessed asked pardon and been punished quite enough we dont keep silence to shield him but someone else and it will make more trouble if you interfere please dont it was partly my fault but its all right now so lets forget it and talk about the rambler or something pleasant  hang the rambler come down and give me your word that this harumscarum boy of mine hasnt done anything ungrateful or impertinent if he has after all your kindness to him ill thrash him with my own hands  the threat sounded awful but did not alarm jo for she knew the irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson whatever he might say to the contrary she obediently descended and made as light of the prank as she could without betraying meg or forgetting the truth  hum ha well if the boy held his tongue because he promised and not from obstinacy ill forgive him hes a stubborn fellow and hard to manage said mr laurence rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he had been out in a gale and smoothing the frown from his brow with an air of relief  so am i but a kind word will govern me when all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt said jo trying to say a kind word for her friend who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into another  you think im not kind to him hey was the sharp answer  oh dear no sir you are rather too kind sometimes and then just a trifle hasty when he tries your patience dont you think you are  jo was determined to have it out now and tried to look quite placid though she quaked a little after her bold speech to her great relief and surprise the old gentleman only threw his spectacles onto the table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly youre right girl i am i love the boy but he tries my patience past bearing and i know how it will end if we go on so  ill tell you hell run away jo was sorry for that speech the minute it was made she meant to warn him that laurie would not bear much restraint and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad  mr laurences ruddy face changed suddenly and he sat down with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man which hung over his table it was lauries father who had run away in his youth and married against the imperious old mans will jo fancied he remembered and regretted the past and she wished she had held her tongue  he wont do it unless he is very much worried and only threatens it sometimes when he gets tired of studying i often think i should like to especially since my hair was cut so if you ever miss us you may advertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for india  she laughed as she spoke and mr laurence looked relieved evidently taking the whole as a joke  you hussy how dare you talk in that way wheres your respect for me and your proper bringing up bless the boys and girls what torments they are yet we cant do without them he said pinching her cheeks goodhumoredly go and bring that boy down to his dinner tell him its all right and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his grandfather i wont bear it  he wont come sir he feels badly because you didnt believe him when he said he couldnt tell i think the shaking hurt his feelings very much  jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed for mr laurence began to laugh and she knew the day was won  im sorry for that and ought to thank him for not shaking me i suppose what the dickens does the fellow expect and the old gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness  if i were you id write him an apology sir he says he wont come down till he has one and talks about washington and goes on in an absurd way a formal apology will make him see how foolish he is and bring him down quite amiable try it he likes fun and this way is better than talking ill carry it up and teach him his duty  mr laurence gave her a sharp look and put on his spectacles saying slowly youre a sly puss but i dont mind being managed by you and beth here give me a bit of paper and let us have done with this nonsense  the note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to another after offering some deep insult jo dropped a kiss on the top of mr laurences bald head and ran up to slip the apology under lauries door advising him through the keyhole to be submissive decorous and a few other agreeable impossibilities finding the door locked again she left the note to do its work and was going quietly away when the young gentleman slid down the banisters and waited for her at the bottom saying with his most virtuous expression of countenance what a good fellow you are jo did you get blown up he added laughing  no he was pretty mild on the whole  ah i got it all round even you cast me off over there and i felt just ready to go to the deuce he began apologetically  dont talk that way turn over a new leaf and begin again teddy my son  i keep turning over new leaves and spoiling them as i used to spoil my copybooks and i make so many beginnings there never will be an end he said dolefully  go and eat your dinner youll feel better after it men always croak when they are hungry and jo whisked out at the front door after that  thats a label on my sect answered laurie quoting amy as he went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the rest of the day  everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over but the mischief was done for though others forgot it meg remembered she never alluded to a certain person but she thought of him a good deal dreamed dreams more than ever and once jo rummaging her sisters desk for stamps found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words mrs john brooke whereat she groaned tragically and cast it into the fire feeling that lauries prank had hastened the evil day for her     chapter twentytwo pleasant meadows   like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed the invalids improved rapidly and mr march began to talk of returning early in the new year beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day amusing herself with the wellbeloved cats at first and in time with dolls sewing which had fallen sadly behindhand her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble that jo took her for a daily airing about the house in her strong arms meg cheerfully blackened and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for the dear while amy a loyal slave of the ring celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept  as christmas approached the usual mysteries began to haunt the house and jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies in honor of this unusually merry christmas laurie was equally impracticable and would have had bonfires skyrockets and triumphal arches if he had had his own way after many skirmishes and snubbings the ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces which were rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together  several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid christmas day hannah felt in her bones that it was going to be an unusually fine day and she proved herself a true prophetess for everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success to begin with mr march wrote that he should soon be with them then beth felt uncommonly well that morning and being dressed in her mothers gift a soft crimson merino wrapper was borne in high triumph to the window to behold the offering of jo and laurie the unquenchables had done their best to be worthy of the name for like elves they had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise out in the garden stood a stately snow maiden crowned with holly bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand a great roll of music in the other a perfect rainbow of an afghan round her chilly shoulders and a christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer  the jungfrau to beth   god bless you dear queen bess may nothing you dismay but health and peace and happiness be yours this christmas day   heres fruit to feed our busy bee and flowers for her nose heres music for her pianee an afghan for her toes   a portrait of joanna see by raphael no 2 who laboured with great industry to make it fair and true   accept a ribbon red i beg for madam purrers tail and ice cream made by lovely peg a mont blanc in a pail   their dearest love my makers laid within my breast of snow accept it and the alpine maid from laurie and from jo   how beth laughed when she saw it how laurie ran up and down to bring in the gifts and what ridiculous speeches jo made as she presented them  im so full of happiness that if father was only here i couldnt hold one drop more said beth quite sighing with contentment as jo carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement and to refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the jungfrau had sent her  so am i added jo slapping the pocket wherein reposed the longdesired undine and sintram  im sure i am echoed amy poring over the engraved copy of the madonna and child which her mother had given her in a pretty frame  of course i am cried meg smoothing the silvery folds of her first silk dress for mr laurence had insisted on giving it how can i be otherwise said mrs march gratefully as her eyes went from her husbands letter to beths smiling face and her hand caressed the brooch made of gray and golden chestnut and dark brown hair which the girls had just fastened on her breast  now and then in this workaday world things do happen in the delightful storybook fashion and what a comfort it is half an hour after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one drop more the drop came laurie opened the parlor door and popped his head in very quietly he might just as well have turned a somersault and uttered an indian war whoop for his face was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped up though he only said in a queer breathless voice heres another christmas present for the march family  before the words were well out of his mouth he was whisked away somehow and in his place appeared a tall man muffled up to the eyes leaning on the arm of another tall man who tried to say something and couldnt of course there was a general stampede and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits for the strangest things were done and no one said a word  mr march became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away and had to be doctored by laurie in the china closet mr brooke kissed meg entirely by mistake as he somewhat incoherently explained and amy the dignified tumbled over a stool and never stopping to get up hugged and cried over her fathers boots in the most touching manner mrs march was the first to recover herself and held up her hand with a warning hush remember beth  but it was too late the study door flew open the little red wrapper appeared on the threshold joy put strength into the feeble limbs and beth ran straight into her fathers arms never mind what happened just after that for the full hearts overflowed washing away the bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present  it was not at all romantic but a hearty laugh set everybody straight again for hannah was discovered behind the door sobbing over the fat turkey which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the kitchen as the laugh subsided mrs march began to thank mr brooke for his faithful care of her husband at which mr brooke suddenly remembered that mr march needed rest and seizing laurie he precipitately retired then the two invalids were ordered to repose which they did by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard  mr march told how he had longed to surprise them and how when the fine weather came he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage of it how devoted brooke had been and how he was altogether a most estimable and upright young man why mr march paused a minute just there and after a glance at meg who was violently poking the fire looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows i leave you to imagine also why mrs march gently nodded her head and asked rather abruptly if he wouldnt like to have something to eat jo saw and understood the look and she stalked grimly away to get wine and beef tea muttering to herself as she slammed the door i hate estimable young men with brown eyes  there never was such a christmas dinner as they had that day the fat turkey was a sight to behold when hannah sent him up stuffed browned and decorated so was the plum pudding which melted in ones mouth likewise the jellies in which amy reveled like a fly in a honeypot everything turned out well which was a mercy hannah said for my mind was that flustered mum that its a merrycle i didnt roast the pudding and stuff the turkey with raisins let alone bilin of it in a cloth  mr laurence and his grandson dined with them also mr brooke at whom jo glowered darkly to lauries infinite amusement two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table in which sat beth and her father feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit they drank healths told stories sang songs reminisced as the old folks say and had a thoroughly good time a sleigh ride had been planned but the girls would not leave their father so the guests departed early and as twilight gathered the happy family sat together round the fire  just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal christmas we expected to have do you remember asked jo breaking a short pause which had followed a long conversation about many things  rather a pleasant year on the whole said meg smiling at the fire and congratulating herself on having treated mr brooke with dignity  i think its been a pretty hard one observed amy watching the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes  im glad its over because weve got you back whispered beth who sat on her fathers knee  rather a rough road for you to travel my little pilgrims especially the latter part of it but you have got on bravely and i think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon said mr march looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered round him  how do you know did mother tell you asked jo  not much straws show which way the wind blows and ive made several discoveries today  oh tell us what they are cried meg who sat beside him  here is one and taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair he pointed to the roughened forefinger a burn on the back and two or three little hard spots on the palm i remember a time when this hand was white and smooth and your first care was to keep it so it was very pretty then but to me it is much prettier now for in this seeming blemishes i read a little history a burnt offering has been made to vanity this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters and im sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time so much good will went into the stitches meg my dear i value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or fashionable accomplishments im proud to shake this good industrious little hand and hope i shall not soon be asked to give it away  if meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor she received it in the hearty pressure of her fathers hand and the approving smile he gave her  what about jo please say something nice for she has tried so hard and been so very very good to me said beth in her fathers ear  he laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite with an unusually mild expression in her face  in spite of the curly crop i dont see the son jo whom i left a year ago said mr march i see a young lady who pins her collar straight laces her boots neatly and neither whistles talks slang nor lies on the rug as she used to do her face is rather thin and pale just now with watching and anxiety but i like to look at it for it has grown gentler and her voice is lower she doesnt bounce but moves quietly and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which delights me i rather miss my wild girl but if i get a strong helpful tenderhearted woman in her place i shall feel quite satisfied i dont know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep but i do know that in all washington i couldnt find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the fiveandtwenty dollars my good girl sent me  jos keen eyes were rather dim for a minute and her thin face grew rosy in the firelight as she received her fathers praise feeling that she did deserve a portion of it  now beth said amy longing for her turn but ready to wait  theres so little of her im afraid to say much for fear she will slip away altogether though she is not so shy as she used to be began their father cheerfully but recollecting how nearly he had lost her he held her close saying tenderly with her cheek against his own ive got you safe my beth and ill keep you so please god  after a minutes silence he looked down at amy who sat on the cricket at his feet and said with a caress of the shining hair  i observed that amy took drumsticks at dinner ran errands for her mother all the afternoon gave meg her place tonight and has waited on every one with patience and good humor i also observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears so i conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less and has decided to try and mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay figures i am glad of this for though i should be very proud of a graceful statue made by her i shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others  what are you thinking of beth asked jo when amy had thanked her father and told about her ring  i read in pilgrims progress today how after many troubles christian and hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies bloomed all year round and there they rested happily as we do now before they went on to their journeys end answered beth adding as she slipped out of her fathers arms and went to the instrument its singing time now and i want to be in my old place ill try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which the pilgrims heard i made the music for father because he likes the verses  so sitting at the dear little piano beth softly touched the keys and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again sang to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn which was a singularly fitting song for her  he that is down need fear no fall he that is low no pride he that is humble ever shall have god to be his guide   i am content with what i have little be it or much and lord contentment still i crave because thou savest such   fulness to them a burden is that go on pilgrimage here little and hereafter bliss is best from age to age     chapter twentythree aunt march settles the question   like bees swarming after their queen mother and daughters hovered about mr march the next day neglecting everything to look at wait upon and listen to the new invalid who was in a fair way to be killed by kindness as he sat propped up in a big chair by beths sofa with the other three close by and hannah popping in her head now and then to peek at the dear man nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness but something was needed and the elder ones felt it though none confessed the fact mr and mrs march looked at one another with an anxious expression as their eyes followed meg jo had sudden fits of sobriety and was seen to shake her fist at mr brookes umbrella which had been left in the hall meg was absentminded shy and silent started when the bell rang and colored when johns name was mentioned amy said everyone seemed waiting for something and couldnt settle down which was queer since father was safe at home and beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didnt run over as usual  laurie went by in the afternoon and seeing meg at the window seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit for he fell down on one knee in the snow beat his breast tore his hair and clasped his hands imploringly as if begging some boon and when meg told him to behave himself and go away he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair  what does the goose mean said meg laughing and trying to look unconscious  hes showing you how your john will go on byandby touching isnt it answered jo scornfully  dont say my john it isnt proper or true but megs voice lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her please dont plague me jo ive told you i dont care much about him and there isnt to be anything said but we are all to be friendly and go on as before  we cant for something has been said and lauries mischief has spoiled you for me i see it and so does mother you are not like your old self a bit and seem ever so far away from me i dont mean to plague you and will bear it like a man but i do wish it was all settled i hate to wait so if you mean ever to do it make haste and have it over quickly said jo pettishly  i cant say anything till he speaks and he wont because father said i was too young began meg bending over her work with a queer little smile which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on that point  if he did speak you wouldnt know what to say but would cry or blush or let him have his own way instead of giving a good decided no  im not so silly and weak as you think i know just what i should say for ive planned it all so i neednt be taken unawares theres no knowing what may happen and i wished to be prepared  jo couldnt help smiling at the important air which meg had unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color varying in her cheeks  would you mind telling me what youd say asked jo more respectfully  not at all you are sixteen now quite old enough to be my confidant and my experience will be useful to you byandby perhaps in your own affairs of this sort  dont mean to have any its fun to watch other people philander but i should feel like a fool doing it myself said jo looking alarmed at the thought  i think not if you liked anyone very much and he liked you meg spoke as if to herself and glanced out at the lane where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight  i thought you were going to tell your speech to that man said jo rudely shortening her sisters little reverie  oh i should merely say quite calmly and decidedly thank you mr brooke you are very kind but i agree with father that i am too young to enter into any engagement at present so please say no more but let us be friends as we were  hum thats stiff and cool enough i dont believe youll ever say it and i know he wont be satisfied if you do if he goes on like the rejected lovers in books youll give in rather than hurt his feelings  no i wont i shall tell him ive made up my mind and shall walk out of the room with dignity  meg rose as she spoke and was just going to rehearse the dignified exit when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given time jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change and when someone gave a modest tap opened the door with a grim aspect which was anything but hospitable  good afternoon i came to get my umbrella that is to see how your father finds himself today said mr brooke getting a trifle confused as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other  its very well hes in the rack ill get him and tell it you are here and having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in her reply jo slipped out of the room to give meg a chance to make her speech and air her dignity but the instant she vanished meg began to sidle toward the door murmuring  mother will like to see you pray sit down ill call her  dont go are you afraid of me margaret and mr brooke looked so hurt that meg thought she must have done something very rude she blushed up to the little curls on her forehead for he had never called her margaret before and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it anxious to appear friendly and at her ease she put out her hand with a confiding gesture and said gratefully  how can i be afraid when you have been so kind to father i only wish i could thank you for it  shall i tell you how asked mr brooke holding the small hand fast in both his own and looking down at meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter and she both longed to run away and to stop and listen  oh no please dont id rather not she said trying to withdraw her hand and looking frightened in spite of her denial  i wont trouble you i only want to know if you care for me a little meg i love you so much dear added mr brooke tenderly  this was the moment for the calm proper speech but meg didnt make it she forgot every word of it hung her head and answered i dont know so softly that john had to stoop down to catch the foolish little reply  he seemed to think it was worth the trouble for he smiled to himself as if quite satisfied pressed the plump hand gratefully and said in his most persuasive tone will you try and find out i want to know so much for i cant go to work with any heart until i learn whether i am to have my reward in the end or not  im too young faltered meg wondering why she was so fluttered yet rather enjoying it  ill wait and in the meantime you could be learning to like me would it be a very hard lesson dear  not if i chose to learn it but    please choose to learn meg i love to teach and this is easier than german broke in john getting possession of the other hand so that she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it  his tone was properly beseeching but stealing a shy look at him meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender and that he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success this nettled her annie moffats foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind and the love of power which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little women woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her she felt excited and strange and not knowing what else to do followed a capricious impulse and withdrawing her hands said petulantly i dont choose please go away and let me be  poor mr brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling about his ears for he had never seen meg in such a mood before and it rather bewildered him  do you really mean that he asked anxiously following her as she walked away  yes i do i dont want to be worried about such things father says i neednt its too soon and id rather not  maynt i hope youll change your mind byandby ill wait and say nothing till you have had more time dont play with me meg i didnt think that of you  dont think of me at all id rather you wouldnt said meg taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her lovers patience and her own power  he was grave and pale now and looked decidedly more like the novel heroes whom she admired but he neither slapped his forehead nor tramped about the room as they did he just stood looking at her so wistfully so tenderly that she found her heart relenting in spite of herself what would have happened next i cannot say if aunt march had not come hobbling in at this interesting minute  the old lady couldnt resist her longing to see her nephew for she had met laurie as she took her airing and hearing of mr marchs arrival drove straight out to see him the family were all busy in the back part of the house and she had made her way quietly in hoping to surprise them she did surprise two of them so much that meg started as if she had seen a ghost and mr brooke vanished into the study  bless me whats all this cried the old lady with a rap of her cane as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady  its fathers friend im so surprised to see you stammered meg feeling that she was in for a lecture now  thats evident returned aunt march sitting down but what is fathers friend saying to make you look like a peony theres mischief going on and i insist upon knowing what it is with another rap  we were only talking mr brooke came for his umbrella began meg wishing that mr brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house  brooke that boys tutor ah i understand now i know all about it jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your fathers letters and i made her tell me you havent gone and accepted him child cried aunt march looking scandalized  hush hell hear shant i call mother said meg much troubled  not yet ive something to say to you and i must free my mind at once tell me do you mean to marry this cook if you do not one penny of my money ever goes to you remember that and be a sensible girl said the old lady impressively  now aunt march possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of opposition in the gentlest people and enjoyed doing it the best of us have a spice of perversity in us especially when we are young and in love if aunt march had begged meg to accept john brooke she would probably have declared she couldnt think of it but as she was preemptorily ordered not to like him she immediately made up her mind that she would inclination as well as perversity made the decision easy and being already much excited meg opposed the old lady with unusual spirit  i shall marry whom i please aunt march and you can leave your money to anyone you like she said nodding her head with a resolute air  hightytighty is that the way you take my advice miss youll be sorry for it byandby when youve tried love in a cottage and found it a failure  it cant be a worse one than some people find in big houses retorted meg  aunt march put on her glasses and took a look at the girl for she did not know her in this new mood meg hardly knew herself she felt so brave and independent so glad to defend john and assert her right to love him if she liked aunt march saw that she had begun wrong and after a little pause made a fresh start saying as mildly as she could now meg my dear be reasonable and take my advice i mean it kindly and dont want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake at the beginning you ought to marry well and help your family its your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed upon you  father and mother dont think so they like john though he is poor  your parents my dear have no more worldly wisdom than a pair of babies  im glad of it cried meg stoutly  aunt march took no notice but went on with her lecture this rook is poor and hasnt got any rich relations has he  no but he has many warm friends  you cant live on friends try it and see how cool theyll grow he hasnt any business has he  not yet mr laurence is going to help him  that wont last long james laurence is a crotchety old fellow and not to be depended on so you intend to marry a man without money position or business and go on working harder than you do now when you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better i thought you had more sense meg  i couldnt do better if i waited half my life john is good and wise hes got heaps of talent hes willing to work and sure to get on hes so energetic and brave everyone likes and respects him and im proud to think he cares for me though im so poor and young and silly said meg looking prettier than ever in her earnestness  he knows you have got rich relations child thats the secret of his liking i suspect  aunt march how dare you say such a thing john is above such meanness and i wont listen to you a minute if you talk so cried meg indignantly forgetting everything but the injustice of the old ladys suspicions my john wouldnt marry for money any more than i would we are willing to work and we mean to wait im not afraid of being poor for ive been happy so far and i know i shall be with him because he loves me and i  meg stopped there remembering all of a sudden that she hadnt made up her mind that she had told her john to go away and that he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks  aunt march was very angry for she had set her heart on having her pretty niece make a fine match and something in the girls happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour  well i wash my hands of the whole affair you are a willful child and youve lost more than you know by this piece of folly no i wont stop im disappointed in you and havent spirits to see your father now dont expect anything from me when you are married your mr brookes friends must take care of you im done with you forever  and slamming the door in megs face aunt march drove off in high dudgeon she seemed to take all the girls courage with her for when left alone meg stood for a moment undecided whether to laugh or cry before she could make up her mind she was taken possession of by mr brooke who said all in one breath i couldnt help hearing meg thank you for defending me and aunt march for proving that you do care for me a little bit  i didnt know how much till she abused you began meg  and i neednt go away but may stay and be happy may i dear  here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the stately exit but meg never thought of doing either and disgraced herself forever in jos eyes by meekly whispering yes john and hiding her face on mr brookes waistcoat  fifteen minutes after aunt marchs departure jo came softly downstairs paused an instant at the parlor door and hearing no sound within nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression saying to herself she has seen him away as we planned and that affair is settled ill go and hear the fun and have a good laugh over it  but poor jo never got her laugh for she was transfixed upon the threshold by a spectacle which held her there staring with her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes going in to exult over a fallen enemy and to praise a strongminded sister for the banishment of an objectionable lover it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa with the strongminded sister enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject submission jo gave a sort of gasp as if a cold shower bath had suddenly fallen upon her for such an unexpected turning of the tables actually took her breath away at the odd sound the lovers turned and saw her meg jumped up looking both proud and shy but that man as jo called him actually laughed and said coolly as he kissed the astonished newcomer sister jo congratulate us  that was adding insult to injury it was altogether too much and making some wild demonstration with her hands jo vanished without a word rushing upstairs she startled the invalids by exclaiming tragically as she burst into the room oh do somebody go down quick john brooke is acting dreadfully and meg likes it  mr and mrs march left the room with speed and casting herself upon the bed jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news to beth and amy the little girls however considered it a most agreeable and interesting event and jo got little comfort from them so she went up to her refuge in the garret and confided her troubles to the rats  nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon but a great deal of talking was done and quiet mr brooke astonished his friends by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit told his plans and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it  the tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which he meant to earn for meg and he proudly took her in to supper both looking so happy that jo hadnt the heart to be jealous or dismal amy was very much impressed by johns devotion and megs dignity beth beamed at them from a distance while mr and mrs march surveyed the young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly evident aunt march was right in calling them as unworldly as a pair of babies no one ate much but everyone looked very happy and the old room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the family began there  you cant say nothing pleasant ever happens now can you meg said amy trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a sketch she was planning to make  no im sure i cant how much has happened since i said that it seems a year ago answered meg who was in a blissful dream lifted far above such common things as bread and butter  the joys come close upon the sorrows this time and i rather think the changes have begun said mrs march in most families there comes now and then a year full of events this has been such a one but it ends well after all  hope the next will end better muttered jo who found it very hard to see meg absorbed in a stranger before her face for jo loved a few persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or lessened in any way  i hope the third year from this will end better i mean it shall if i live to work out my plans said mr brooke smiling at meg as if everything had become possible to him now  doesnt it seem very long to wait asked amy who was in a hurry for the wedding  ive got so much to learn before i shall be ready it seems a short time to me answered meg with a sweet gravity in her face never seen there before  you have only to wait i am to do the work said john beginning his labors by picking up megs napkin with an expression which caused jo to shake her head and then say to herself with an air of relief as the front door banged here comes laurie now we shall have some sensible conversation  but jo was mistaken for laurie came prancing in overflowing with good spirits bearing a great bridallooking bouquet for mrs john brooke and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had been brought about by his excellent management  i knew brooke would have it all his own way he always does for when he makes up his mind to accomplish anything its done though the sky falls said laurie when he had presented his offering and his congratulations  much obliged for that recommendation i take it as a good omen for the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot answered mr brooke who felt at peace with all mankind even his mischievous pupil  ill come if im at the ends of the earth for the sight of jos face alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey you dont look festive maam whats the matter asked laurie following her into a corner of the parlor whither all had adjourned to greet mr laurence  i dont approve of the match but ive made up my mind to bear it and shall not say a word against it said jo solemnly you cant know how hard it is for me to give up meg she continued with a little quiver in her voice  you dont give her up you only go halves said laurie consolingly  it can never be the same again ive lost my dearest friend sighed jo  youve got me anyhow im not good for much i know but ill stand by you jo all the days of my life upon my word i will and laurie meant what he said  i know you will and im ever so much obliged you are always a great comfort to me teddy returned jo gratefully shaking hands  well now dont be dismal theres a good fellow its all right you see meg is happy brooke will fly round and get settled immediately grandpa will attend to him and it will be very jolly to see meg in her own little house well have capital times after she is gone for i shall be through college before long and then well go abroad on some nice trip or other wouldnt that console you  i rather think it would but theres no knowing what may happen in three years said jo thoughtfully  thats true dont you wish you could take a look forward and see where we shall all be then i do returned laurie  i think not for i might see something sad and everyone looks so happy now i dont believe they could be much improved and jos eyes went slowly round the room brightening as they looked for the prospect was a pleasant one  father and mother sat together quietly reliving the first chapter of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago amy was drawing the lovers who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own the light of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not copy beth lay on her sofa talking cheerily with her old friend who held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead him along the peaceful way she walked jo lounged in her favorite low seat with the grave quiet look which best became her and laurie leaning on the back of her chair his chin on a level with her curly head smiled with his friendliest aspect and nodded at her in the long glass which reflected them both  so the curtain falls upon meg jo beth and amy whether it ever rises again depends upon the reception given the first act of the domestic drama called little women     part 2   in order that we may start afresh and go to megs wedding     chapter twentyfour gossip   in order that we may start afresh and go to megs wedding with free minds it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the marches and here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too much lovering in the story as i fear they may im not afraid the young folks will make that objection i can only say with mrs march what can you expect when i have four gay girls in the house and a dashing young neighbor over the way  the three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the quiet family the war is over and mr march safely at home busy with his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature as by grace a quiet studious man rich in the wisdom that is better than learning the charity which calls all mankind brother the piety that blossoms into character making it august and lovely  these attributes in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which shut him out from the more worldly successes attracted to him many admirable persons as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees and as naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard experience had distilled no bitter drop earnest young men found the grayheaded scholar as young at heart as they thoughtful or troubled women instinctively brought their doubts to him sure of finding the gentlest sympathy the wisest counsel sinners told their sins to the purehearted old man and were both rebuked and saved gifted men found a companion in him ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions than their own and even worldlings confessed that his beliefs were beautiful and true although they wouldnt pay  to outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house and so they did in many things but the quiet scholar sitting among his books was still the head of the family the household conscience anchor and comforter for to him the busy anxious women always turned in troublous times finding him in the truest sense of those sacred words husband and father  the girls gave their hearts into their mothers keeping their souls into their fathers and to both parents who lived and labored so faithfully for them they gave a love that grew with their growth and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and outlives death  mrs march is as brisk and cheery though rather grayer than when we saw her last and just now so absorbed in megs affairs that the hospitals and homes still full of wounded boys and soldiers widows decidedly miss the motherly missionarys visits  john brooke did his duty manfully for a year got wounded was sent home and not allowed to return he received no stars or bars but he deserved them for he cheerfully risked all he had and life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom perfectly resigned to his discharge he devoted himself to getting well preparing for business and earning a home for meg with the good sense and sturdy independence that characterized him he refused mr laurences more generous offers and accepted the place of bookkeeper feeling better satisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any risks with borrowed money  meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting growing womanly in character wise in housewifely arts and prettier than ever for love is a great beautifier she had her girlish ambitions and hopes and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin ned moffat had just married sallie gardiner and meg couldnt help contrasting their fine house and carriage many gifts and splendid outfit with her own and secretly wishing she could have the same but somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the patient love and labor john had put into the little home awaiting her and when they sat together in the twilight talking over their small plans the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot sallies splendor and felt herself the richest happiest girl in christendom  jo never went back to aunt march for the old lady took such a fancy to amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of the best teachers going and for the sake of this advantage amy would have served a far harder mistress so she gave her mornings to duty her afternoons to pleasure and prospered finely jo meantime devoted herself to literature and beth who remained delicate long after the fever was a thing of the past not an invalid exactly but never again the rosy healthy creature she had been yet always hopeful happy and serene and busy with the quiet duties she loved everyones friend and an angel in the house long before those who loved her most had learned to know it  as long as the spread eagle paid her a dollar a column for her rubbish as she called it jo felt herself a woman of means and spun her little romances diligently but great plans fermented in her busy brain and ambitious mind and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript which was one day to place the name of march upon the roll of fame  laurie having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather was now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please himself a universal favorite thanks to money manners much talent and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to get other people out of them he stood in great danger of being spoiled and probably would have been like many another promising boy if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in his success the motherly friend who watched over him as if he were her son and last but not least by any means the knowledge that four innocent girls loved admired and believed in him with all their hearts  being only a glorious human boy of course he frolicked and flirted grew dandified aquatic sentimental or gymnastic as college fashions ordained hazed and was hazed talked slang and more than once came perilously near suspension and expulsion but as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes of these pranks he always managed to save himself by frank confession honorable atonement or the irresistible power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection in fact he rather prided himself on his narrow escapes and liked to thrill the girls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors dignified professors and vanquished enemies the men of my class were heroes in the eyes of the girls who never wearied of the exploits of our fellows and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these great creatures when laurie brought them home with him  amy especially enjoyed this high honor and became quite a belle among them for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of fascination with which she was endowed meg was too much absorbed in her private and particular john to care for any other lords of creation and beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how amy dared to order them about so but jo felt quite in her own element and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes phrases and feats which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed for young ladies they all liked jo immensely but never fell in love with her though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at amys shrine and speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the dovecote  that was the name of the little brown house mr brooke had prepared for megs first home laurie had christened it saying it was highly appropriate to the gentle lovers who went on together like a pair of turtledoves with first a bill and then a coo it was a tiny house with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket handkerchief in the front here meg meant to have a fountain shrubbery and a profusion of lovely flowers though just at present the fountain was represented by a weatherbeaten urn very like a dilapidated slopbowl the shrubbery consisted of several young larches undecided whether to live or die and the profusion of flowers was merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted but inside it was altogether charming and the happy bride saw no fault from garret to cellar to be sure the hall was so narrow it was fortunate that they had no piano for one never could have been got in whole the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of precipitating both servants and china pellmell into the coalbin but once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing could be more complete for good sense and good taste had presided over the furnishing and the result was highly satisfactory there were no marbletopped tables long mirrors or lace curtains in the little parlor but simple furniture plenty of books a fine picture or two a stand of flowers in the bay window and scattered all about the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the loving messages they brought  i dont think the parian psyche laurie gave lost any of its beauty because john put up the bracket it stood upon that any upholsterer could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than amys artistic hand or that any storeroom was ever better provided with good wishes merry words and happy hopes than that in which jo and her mother put away megs few boxes barrels and bundles and i am morally certain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and neat if hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over and laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute mis brooke came home i also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a supply of dusters holders and piece bags for beth made enough to last till the silver wedding came round and invented three different kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china  people who hire all these things done for them never know what they lose for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them and meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table was eloquent of home love and tender forethought  what happy times they had planning together what solemn shopping excursions what funny mistakes they made and what shouts of laughter arose over lauries ridiculous bargains in his love of jokes this young gentleman though nearly through college was a much of a boy as ever his last whim had been to bring with him on his weekly visits some new useful and ingenious article for the young housekeeper now a bag of remarkable clothespins next a wonderful nutmeg grater which fell to pieces at the first trial a knife cleaner that spoiled all the knives or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left the dirt laborsaving soap that took the skin off ones hands infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the deluded buyer and every kind of tinware from a toy savings bank for odd pennies to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own steam with every prospect of exploding in the process  in vain meg begged him to stop john laughed at him and jo called him mr toodles he was possessed with a mania for patronizing yankee ingenuity and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth so each week beheld some fresh absurdity  everything was done at last even to amys arranging different colored soaps to match the different colored rooms and beths setting the table for the first meal  are you satisfied does it seem like home and do you feel as if you should be happy here asked mrs march as she and her daughter went through the new kingdom arm in arm for just then they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever  yes mother perfectly satisfied thanks to you all and so happy that i cant talk about it with a look that was far better than words  if she only had a servant or two it would be all right said amy coming out of the parlor where she had been trying to decide whether the bronze mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece  mother and i have talked that over and i have made up my mind to try her way first there will be so little to do that with lotty to run my errands and help me here and there i shall only have enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick answered meg tranquilly  sallie moffat has four began amy  if meg had four the house wouldnt hold them and master and missis would have to camp in the garden broke in jo who enveloped in a big blue pinafore was giving the last polish to the door handles  sallie isnt a poor mans wife and many maids are in keeping with her fine establishment meg and john begin humbly but i have a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big one its a great mistake for young girls like meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress give orders and gossip when i was first married i used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn so that i might have the pleasure of mending them for i got heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief  why didnt you go into the kitchen and make messes as sallie says she does to amuse herself though they never turn out well and the servants laugh at her said meg  i did after a while not to mess but to learn of hannah how things should be done that my servants need not laugh at me it was play then but there came a time when i was truly grateful that i not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little girls and help myself when i could no longer afford to hire help you begin at the other end meg dear but the lessons you learn now will be of use to you byandby when john is a richer man for the mistress of a house however splendid should know how work ought to be done if she wishes to be well and honestly served  yes mother im sure of that said meg listening respectfully to the little lecture for the best of women will hold forth upon the all absorbing subject of house keeping do you know i like this room most of all in my baby house added meg a minute after as they went upstairs and she looked into her wellstored linen closet  beth was there laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and exulting over the goodly array all three laughed as meg spoke for that linen closet was a joke you see having said that if meg married that brooke she shouldnt have a cent of her money aunt march was rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her vow she never broke her word and was much exercised in her mind how to get round it and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy herself mrs carrol florences mamma was ordered to buy have made and marked a generous supply of house and table linen and send it as her present all of which was faithfully done but the secret leaked out and was greatly enjoyed by the family for aunt march tried to look utterly unconscious and insisted that she could give nothing but the oldfashioned pearls long promised to the first bride  thats a housewifely taste which i am glad to see i had a young friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets but she had finger bowls for company and that satisfied her said mrs march patting the damask tablecloths with a truly feminine appreciation of their fineness  i havent a single finger bowl but this is a setout that will last me all my days hannah says and meg looked quite contented as well she might  a tall broadshouldered young fellow with a cropped head a felt basin of a hat and a flyaway coat came tramping down the road at a great pace walked over the low fence without stopping to open the gate straight up to mrs march with both hands out and a hearty  here i am mother yes its all right  the last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him a kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the little ceremony closed as usual with a motherly kiss  for mrs john brooke with the makers congratulations and compliments bless you beth what a refreshing spectacle you are jo amy you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady  as laurie spoke he delivered a brown paper parcel to meg pulled beths hair ribbon stared at jos big pinafore and fell into an attitude of mock rapture before amy then shook hands all round and everyone began to talk  where is john asked meg anxiously  stopped to get the license for tomorrow maam  which side won the last match teddy inquired jo who persisted in feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years  ours of course wish youd been there to see  how is the lovely miss randal asked amy with a significant smile  more cruel than ever dont you see how im pining away and laurie gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh  whats the last joke undo the bundle and see meg said beth eying the knobby parcel with curiosity  its a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves observed laurie as a watchmans rattle appeared amid the laughter of the girls  any time when john is away and you get frightened mrs meg just swing that out of the front window and it will rouse the neighborhood in a jiffy nice thing isnt it and laurie gave them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears  theres gratitude for you and speaking of gratitude reminds me to mention that you may thank hannah for saving your wedding cake from destruction i saw it going into your house as i came by and if she hadnt defended it manfully id have had a pick at it for it looked like a remarkably plummy one  i wonder if you will ever grow up laurie said meg in a matronly tone  im doing my best maam but cant get much higher im afraid as six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days responded the young gentleman whose head was about level with the little chandelier  i suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this spickandspan bower so as im tremendously hungry i propose an adjournment he added presently  mother and i are going to wait for john there are some last things to settle said meg bustling away  beth and i are going over to kitty bryants to get more flowers for tomorrow added amy tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque curls and enjoying the effect as much as anybody  come jo dont desert a fellow im in such a state of exhaustion i cant get home without help dont take off your apron whatever you do its peculiarly becoming said laurie as jo bestowed his especial aversion in her capacious pocket and offered her arm to support his feeble steps  now teddy i want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow began jo as they strolled away together you must promise to behave well and not cut up any pranks and spoil our plans  not a prank  and dont say funny things when we ought to be sober  i never do you are the one for that  and i implore you not to look at me during the ceremony i shall certainly laugh if you do  you wont see me youll be crying so hard that the thick fog round you will obscure the prospect  i never cry unless for some great affliction  such as fellows going to college hey cut in laurie with suggestive laugh  dont be a peacock i only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company  exactly i say jo how is grandpa this week pretty amiable  very why have you got into a scrape and want to know how hell take it asked jo rather sharply  now jo do you think id look your mother in the face and say all right if it wasnt and laurie stopped short with an injured air  no i dont  then dont go and be suspicious i only want some money said laurie walking on again appeased by her hearty tone  you spend a great deal teddy  bless you i dont spend it it spends itself somehow and is gone before i know it  you are so generous and kindhearted that you let people borrow and cant say no to anyone we heard about henshaw and all you did for him if you always spent money in that way no one would blame you said jo warmly  oh he made a mountain out of a molehill you wouldnt have me let that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little help when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps would you  of course not but i dont see the use of your having seventeen waistcoats endless neckties and a new hat every time you come home i thought youd got over the dandy period but every now and then it breaks out in a new spot just now its the fashion to be hideous to make your head look like a scrubbing brush wear a strait jacket orange gloves and clumping squaretoed boots if it was cheap ugliness id say nothing but it costs as much as the other and i dont get any satisfaction out of it  laurie threw back his head and laughed so heartily at this attack that the felt hat fell off and jo walked on it which insult only afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a roughandready costume as he folded up the maltreated hat and stuffed it into his pocket  dont lecture any more theres a good soul i have enough all through the week and like to enjoy myself when i come home ill get myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction to my friends  ill leave you in peace if youll only let your hair grow im not aristocratic but i do object to being seen with a person who looks like a young prize fighter observed jo severely  this unassuming style promotes study thats why we adopt it returned laurie who certainly could not be accused of vanity having voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for quarterinchlong stubble  by the way jo i think that little parker is really getting desperate about amy he talks of her constantly writes poetry and moons about in a most suspicious manner hed better nip his little passion in the bud hadnt he added laurie in a confidential elder brotherly tone after a minutes silence  of course he had we dont want any more marrying in this family for years to come mercy on us what are the children thinking of and jo looked as much scandalized as if amy and little parker were not yet in their teens  its a fast age and i dont know what we are coming to maam you are a mere infant but youll go next jo and well be left lamenting said laurie shaking his head over the degeneracy of the times  dont be alarmed im not one of the agreeable sort nobody will want me and its a mercy for there should always be one old maid in a family  you wont give anyone a chance said laurie with a sidelong glance and a little more color than before in his sunburned face you wont show the soft side of your character and if a fellow gets a peep at it by accident and cant help showing that he likes it you treat him as mrs gummidge did her sweetheart throw cold water over him and get so thorny no one dares touch or look at you  i dont like that sort of thing im too busy to be worried with nonsense and i think its dreadful to break up families so now dont say any more about it megs wedding has turned all our heads and we talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities i dont wish to get cross so lets change the subject and jo looked quite ready to fling cold water on the slightest provocation  whatever his feelings might have been laurie found a vent for them in a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted at the gate mark my words jo youll go next     chapter twentyfive the first wedding   the june roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that morning rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine like friendly little neighbors as they were quite flushed with excitement were their ruddy faces as they swung in the wind whispering to one another what they had seen for some peeped in at the dining room windows where the feast was spread some climbed up to nod and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride others waved a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden porch and hall and all from the rosiest fullblown flower to the palest baby bud offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had loved and tended them so long  meg looked very like a rose herself for all that was best and sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day making it fair and tender with a charm more beautiful than beauty neither silk lace nor orange flowers would she have i dont want a fashionable wedding but only those about me whom i love and to them i wish to look and be my familiar self  so she made her wedding gown herself sewing into it the tender hopes and innocent romances of a girlish heart her sisters braided up her pretty hair and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the valley which her john liked best of all the flowers that grew  you do look just like our own dear meg only so very sweet and lovely that i should hug you if it wouldnt crumple your dress cried amy surveying her with delight when all was done  then i am satisfied but please hug and kiss me everyone and dont mind my dress i want a great many crumples of this sort put into it today and meg opened her arms to her sisters who clung about her with april faces for a minute feeling that the new love had not changed the old  now im going to tie johns cravat for him and then to stay a few minutes with father quietly in the study and meg ran down to perform these little ceremonies and then to follow her mother wherever she went conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face there was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the first bird from the nest  as the younger girls stand together giving the last touches to their simple toilet it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which three years have wrought in their appearance for all are looking their best just now  jos angles are much softened she has learned to carry herself with ease if not grace the curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure there is a fresh color in her brown cheeks a soft shine in her eyes and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today  beth has grown slender pale and more quiet than ever the beautiful kind eyes are larger and in them lies an expression that saddens one although it is not sad itself it is the shadow of pain which touches the young face with such pathetic patience but beth seldom complains and always speaks hopefully of being better soon  amy is with truth considered the flower of the family for at sixteen she has the air and bearing of a fullgrown woman not beautiful but possessed of that indescribable charm called grace one saw it in the lines of her figure the make and motion of her hands the flow of her dress the droop of her hair unconscious yet harmonious and as attractive to many as beauty itself amys nose still afflicted her for it never would grow grecian so did her mouth being too wide and having a decided chin these offending features gave character to her whole face but she never could see it and consoled herself with her wonderfully fair complexion keen blue eyes and curls more golden and abundant than ever  all three wore suits of thin silver gray their best gowns for the summer with blush roses in hair and bosom and all three looked just what they were freshfaced happyhearted girls pausing a moment in their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the romance of womanhood  there were to be no ceremonious performances everything was to be as natural and homelike as possible so when aunt march arrived she was scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down and to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm  upon my word heres a state of things cried the old lady taking the seat of honor prepared for her and settling the folds of her lavender moire with a great rustle you oughtnt to be seen till the last minute child  im not a show aunty and no one is coming to stare at me to criticize my dress or count the cost of my luncheon im too happy to care what anyone says or thinks and im going to have my little wedding just as i like it john dear heres your hammer and away went meg to help that man in his highly improper employment  mr brooke didnt even say thank you but as he stooped for the unromantic tool he kissed his little bride behind the folding door with a look that made aunt march whisk out her pocket handkerchief with a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes  a crash a cry and a laugh from laurie accompanied by the indecorous exclamation jupiter ammon jos upset the cake again caused a momentary flurry which was hardly over when a flock of cousins arrived and the party came in as beth used to say when a child  dont let that young giant come near me he worries me worse than mosquitoes whispered the old lady to amy as the rooms filled and lauries black head towered above the rest  he has promised to be very good today and he can be perfectly elegant if he likes returned amy and gliding away to warn hercules to beware of the dragon which warning caused him to haunt the old lady with a devotion that nearly distracted her  there was no bridal procession but a sudden silence fell upon the room as mr march and the young couple took their places under the green arch mother and sisters gathered close as if loath to give meg up the fatherly voice broke more than once which only seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn the bridegrooms hand trembled visibly and no one heard his replies but meg looked straight up in her husbands eyes and said i will with such tender trust in her own face and voice that her mothers heart rejoiced and aunt march sniffed audibly  jo did not cry though she was very near it once and was only saved from a demonstration by the consciousness that laurie was staring fixedly at her with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his wicked black eyes beth kept her face hidden on her mothers shoulder but amy stood like a graceful statue with a most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair  it wasnt at all the thing im afraid but the minute she was fairly married meg cried the first kiss for marmee and turning gave it with her heart on her lips during the next fifteen minutes she looked more like a rose than ever for everyone availed themselves of their privileges to the fullest extent from mr laurence to old hannah who adorned with a headdress fearfully and wonderfully made fell upon her in the hall crying with a sob and a chuckle bless you deary a hundred times the cake aint hurt a mite and everything looks lovely  everybody cleared up after that and said something brilliant or tried to which did just as well for laughter is ready when hearts are light there was no display of gifts for they were already in the little house nor was there an elaborate breakfast but a plentiful lunch of cake and fruit dressed with flowers mr laurence and aunt march shrugged and smiled at one another when water lemonade and coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three hebes carried round no one said anything till laurie who insisted on serving the bride appeared before her with a loaded salver in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face  has jo smashed all the bottles by accident he whispered or am i merely laboring under a delusion that i saw some lying about loose this morning  no your grandfather kindly offered us his best and aunt march actually sent some but father put away a little for beth and dispatched the rest to the soldiers home you know he thinks that wine should be used only in illness and mother says that neither she nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof  meg spoke seriously and expected to see laurie frown or laugh but he did neither for after a quick look at her he said in his impetuous way i like that for ive seen enough harm done to wish other women would think as you do  you are not made wise by experience i hope and there was an anxious accent in megs voice  no i give you my word for it dont think too well of me either this is not one of my temptations being brought up where wine is as common as water and almost as harmless i dont care for it but when a pretty girl offers it one doesnt like to refuse you see  but you will for the sake of others if not for your own come laurie promise and give me one more reason to call this the happiest day of my life  a demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment for ridicule is often harder to bear than selfdenial meg knew that if he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs and feeling her power used it as a woman may for her friends good she did not speak but she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness and a smile which said no one can refuse me anything today  laurie certainly could not and with an answering smile he gave her his hand saying heartily i promise mrs brooke  i thank you very very much  and i drink long life to your resolution teddy cried jo baptizing him with a splash of lemonade as she waved her glass and beamed approvingly upon him  so the toast was drunk the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of many temptations for with instinctive wisdom the girls seized a happy moment to do their friend a service for which he thanked them all his life  after lunch people strolled about by twos and threes through the house and garden enjoying the sunshine without and within meg and john happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass plot when laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing touch to this unfashionable wedding  all the married people take hands and dance round the newmade husband and wife as the germans do while we bachelors and spinsters prance in couples outside cried laurie promenading down the path with amy with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their example without a murmur mr and mrs march aunt and uncle carrol began it others rapidly joined in even sallie moffat after a moments hesitation threw her train over her arm and whisked ned into the ring but the crowning joke was mr laurence and aunt march for when the stately old gentleman chasseed solemnly up to the old lady she just tucked her cane under her arm and hopped briskly away to join hands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair while the young folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day  want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close and then people began to go  i wish you well my dear i heartily wish you well but i think youll be sorry for it said aunt march to meg adding to the bridegroom as he led her to the carriage youve got a treasure young man see that you deserve it  that is the prettiest wedding ive been to for an age ned and i dont see why for there wasnt a bit of style about it observed mrs moffat to her husband as they drove away  laurie my lad if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing get one of those little girls to help you and i shall be perfectly satisfied said mr laurence settling himself in his easy chair to rest after the excitement of the morning  ill do my best to gratify you sir was lauries unusually dutiful reply as he carefully unpinned the posy jo had put in his buttonhole  the little house was not far away and the only bridal journey meg had was the quiet walk with john from the old home to the new when she came down looking like a pretty quakeress in her dovecolored suit and straw bonnet tied with white they all gathered about her to say goodby as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour  dont feel that i am separated from you marmee dear or that i love you any the less for loving john so much she said clinging to her mother with full eyes for a moment i shall come every day father and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts though i am married beth is going to be with me a great deal and the other girls will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles thank you all for my happy wedding day goodby goodby  they stood watching her with faces full of love and hope and tender pride as she walked away leaning on her husbands arm with her hands full of flowers and the june sunshine brightening her happy faceand so megs married life began     chapter twentysix artistic attempts   it takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and genius especially ambitious young men and women amy was learning this distinction through much tribulation for mistaking enthusiasm for inspiration she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity for a long time there was a lull in the mudpie business and she devoted herself to the finest penandink drawing in which she showed such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant and profitable but overstrained eyes caused pen and ink to be laid aside for a bold attempt at pokersketching while this attack lasted the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration for the odor of burning wood pervaded the house at all hours smoke issued from attic and shed with alarming frequency redhot pokers lay about promiscuously and hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and the dinner bell at her door in case of fire raphaels face was found boldly executed on the underside of the moulding board and bacchus on the head of a beer barrel a chanting cherub adorned the cover of the sugar bucket and attempts to portray romeo and juliet supplied kindling for some time  from fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers and amy fell to painting with undiminished ardor an artist friend fitted her out with his castoff palettes brushes and colors and she daubed away producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on land or sea her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken prizes at an agricultural fair and the perilous pitching of her vessels would have produced seasickness in the most nautical observer if the utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging had not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance swarthy boys and darkeyed madonnas staring at you from one corner of the studio suggested murillo oily brown shadows of faces with a lurid streak in the wrong place meant rembrandt buxom ladies and dropiscal infants rubens and turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder orange lightning brown rain and purple clouds with a tomatocolored splash in the middle which might be the sun or a bouy a sailors shirt or a kings robe as the spectator pleased  charcoal portraits came next and the entire family hung in a row looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin softened into crayon sketches they did better for the likenesses were good and amys hair jos nose megs mouth and lauries eyes were pronounced wonderfully fine a return to clay and plaster followed and ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house or tumbled off closet shelves onto peoples heads children were enticed in as models till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings caused miss amy to be regarded in the light of a young ogress her efforts in this line however were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident which quenched her ardor other models failing her for a time she undertook to cast her own pretty foot and the family were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running to the rescue found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed with her foot held fast in a pan full of plaster which had hardened with unexpected rapidity with much difficulty and some danger she was dug out for jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that her knife went too far cut the poor foot and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt at least  after this amy subsided till a mania for sketching from nature set her to haunting river field and wood for picturesque studies and sighing for ruins to copy she caught endless colds sitting on damp grass to book a delicious bit composed of a stone a stump one mushroom and a broken mullein stalk or a heavenly mass of clouds that looked like a choice display of featherbeds when done she sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun to study light and shade and got a wrinkle over her nose trying after points of sight or whatever the squintandstring performance is called  if genius is eternal patience as michelangelo affirms amy had some claim to the divine attribute for she persevered in spite of all obstacles failures and discouragements firmly believing that in time she should do something worthy to be called high art  she was learning doing and enjoying other things meanwhile for she had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman even if she never became a great artist here she succeeded better for she was one of those happily created beings who please without effort make friends everywhere and take life so gracefully and easily that less fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky star everybody liked her for among her good gifts was tact she had an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper always said the right thing to the right person did just what suited the time and place and was so selfpossessed that her sisters used to say if amy went to court without any rehearsal beforehand shed know exactly what to do  one of her weaknesses was a desire to move in our best society without being quite sure what the best really was money position fashionable accomplishments and elegant manners were most desirable things in her eyes and she liked to associate with those who possessed them often mistaking the false for the true and admiring what was not admirable never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman she cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings so that when the opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which poverty now excluded her  my lady as her friends called her sincerely desired to be a genuine lady and was so at heart but had yet to learn that money cannot buy refinement of nature that rank does not always confer nobility and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks  i want to ask a favor of you mamma amy said coming in with an important air one day  well little girl what is it replied her mother in whose eyes the stately young lady still remained the baby  our drawing class breaks up next week and before the girls separate for the summer i want to ask them out here for a day they are wild to see the river sketch the broken bridge and copy some of the things they admire in my book they have been very kind to me in many ways and i am grateful for they are all rich and i know i am poor yet they never made any difference  why should they and mrs march put the question with what the girls called her maria theresa air  you know as well as i that it does make a difference with nearly everyone so dont ruffle up like a dear motherly hen when your chickens get pecked by smarter birds the ugly duckling turned out a swan you know and amy smiled without bitterness for she possessed a happy temper and hopeful spirit  mrs march laughed and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked well my swan what is your plan  i should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week to take them for a drive to the places they want to see a row on the river perhaps and make a little artistic fete for them  that looks feasible what do you want for lunch cake sandwiches fruit and coffee will be all that is necessary i suppose  oh dear no we must have cold tongue and chicken french chocolate and ice cream besides the girls are used to such things and i want my lunch to be proper and elegant though i do work for my living  how many young ladies are there asked her mother beginning to look sober  twelve or fourteen in the class but i dare say they wont all come  bless me child you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them about  why mother how can you think of such a thing not more than six or eight will probably come so i shall hire a beach wagon and borrow mr laurences cherrybounce hannahs pronunciation of charabanc  all of this will be expensive amy  not very ive calculated the cost and ill pay for it myself  dont you think dear that as these girls are used to such things and the best we can do will be nothing new that some simpler plan would be pleasanter to them as a change if nothing more and much better for us than buying or borrowing what we dont need and attempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances  if i cant have it as i like i dont care to have it at all i know that i can carry it out perfectly well if you and the girls will help a little and i dont see why i cant if im willing to pay for it said amy with the decision which opposition was apt to change into obstinacy  mrs march knew that experience was an excellent teacher and when it was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she would gladly have made easier if they had not objected to taking advice as much as they did salts and senna  very well amy if your heart is set upon it and you see your way through without too great an outlay of money time and temper ill say no more talk it over with the girls and whichever way you decide ill do my best to help you  thanks mother you are always so kind and away went amy to lay her plan before her sisters  meg agreed at once and promised her aid gladly offering anything she possessed from her little house itself to her very best saltspoons but jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with it at first  why in the world should you spend your money worry your family and turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who dont care a sixpence for you i thought you had too much pride and sense to truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears french boots and rides in a coupe said jo who being called from the tragic climax of her novel was not in the best mood for social enterprises  i dont truckle and i hate being patronized as much as you do returned amy indignantly for the two still jangled when such questions arose the girls do care for me and i for them and theres a great deal of kindness and sense and talent among them in spite of what you call fashionable nonsense you dont care to make people like you to go into good society and cultivate your manners and tastes i do and i mean to make the most of every chance that comes you can go through the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air and call it independence if you like thats not my way  when amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the best of it for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side while jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to such an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an argument amys definition of jos idea of independence was such a good hit that both burst out laughing and the discussion took a more amiable turn much against her will jo at length consented to sacrifice a day to mrs grundy and help her sister through what she regarded as a nonsensical business  the invitations were sent nearly all accepted and the following monday was set apart for the grand event hannah was out of humor because her weeks work was deranged and prophesied that ef the washin and ironin warnt done reglar nothin would go well anywheres this hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had a bad effect upon the whole concern but amys motto was nil desperandum and having made up her mind what to do she proceeded to do it in spite of all obstacles to begin with hannahs cooking didnt turn out well the chicken was tough the tongue too salty and the chocolate wouldnt froth properly then the cake and ice cost more than amy expected so did the wagon and various other expenses which seemed trifling at the outset counted up rather alarmingly afterward beth got a cold and took to her bed meg had an unusual number of callers to keep her at home and jo was in such a divided state of mind that her breakages accidents and mistakes were uncommonly numerous serious and trying  if it was not fair on monday the young ladies were to come on tuesday an arrangement which aggravated jo and hannah to the last degree on monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more exasperating than a steady pour it drizzled a little shone a little blew a little and didnt make up its mind till it was too late for anyone else to make up theirs amy was up at dawn hustling people out of their beds and through their breakfasts that the house might be got in order the parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby but without stopping to sigh for what she had not she skillfully made the best of what she had arranging chairs over the worn places in the carpet covering stains on the walls with homemade statuary which gave an artistic air to the room as did the lovely vases of flowers jo scattered about  the lunch looked charming and as she surveyed it she sincerely hoped it would taste well and that the borrowed glass china and silver would get safely home again the carriages were promised meg and mother were all ready to do the honors beth was able to help hannah behind the scenes jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an absent mind and aching head and a very decided disapproval of everybody and everything would allow and as she wearily dressed amy cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when lunch safely over she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights for the cherry bounce and the broken bridge were her strong points  then came the hours of suspense during which she vibrated from parlor to porch while public opinion varied like the weathercock a smart shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young ladies who were to arrive at twelve for nobody came and at two the exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the perishable portions of the feast that nothing might be lost  no doubt about the weather today they will certainly come so we must fly round and be ready for them said amy as the sun woke her next morning she spoke briskly but in her secret soul she wished she had said nothing about tuesday for her interest like her cake was getting a little stale  i cant get any lobsters so you will have to do without salad today said mr march coming in half an hour later with an expression of placid despair  use the chicken then the toughness wont matter in a salad advised his wife  hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute and the kittens got at it im very sorry amy added beth who was still a patroness of cats  then i must have a lobster for tongue alone wont do said amy decidedly  shall i rush into town and demand one asked jo with the magnanimity of a martyr  youd come bringing it home under your arm without any paper just to try me ill go myself answered amy whose temper was beginning to fail  shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket she departed feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit and fit her for the labors of the day after some delay the object of her desire was procured likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further loss of time at home and off she drove again well pleased with her own forethought  as the omnibus contained only one other passenger a sleepy old lady amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to find out where all her money had gone to so busy was she with her card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a newcomer who entered without stopping the vehicle till a masculine voice said good morning miss march and looking up she beheld one of lauries most elegant college friends fervently hoping that he would get out before she did amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet and congratulating herself that she had on her new traveling dress returned the young mans greeting with her usual suavity and spirit  they got on excellently for amys chief care was soon set at rest by learning that the gentleman would leave first and she was chatting away in a peculiarly lofty strain when the old lady got out in stumbling to the door she upset the basket andoh horrorthe lobster in all its vulgar size and brilliancy was revealed to the highborn eyes of a tudor  by jove shes forgotten her dinner cried the unconscious youth poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane and preparing to hand out the basket after the old lady  please dontitsits mine murmured amy with a face nearly as red as her fish  oh really i beg pardon its an uncommonly fine one isnt it said tudor with great presence of mind and an air of sober interest that did credit to his breeding  amy recovered herself in a breath set her basket boldly on the seat and said laughing dont you wish you were to have some of the salad hes going to make and to see the charming young ladies who are to eat it  now that was tact for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind were touched the lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of pleasing reminiscences and curiosity about the charming young ladies diverted his mind from the comical mishap  i suppose hell laugh and joke over it with laurie but i shant see them thats a comfort thought amy as tudor bowed and departed  she did not mention this meeting at home though she discovered that thanks to the upset her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of dressing that meandered down the skirt but went through with the preparations which now seemed more irksome than before and at twelve oclock all was ready again feeling that the neighbors were interested in her movements she wished to efface the memory of yesterdays failure by a grand success today so she ordered the cherry bounce and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests to the banquet  theres the rumble theyre coming ill go onto the porch and meet them it looks hospitable and i want the poor child to have a good time after all her trouble said mrs march suiting the action to the word but after one glance she retired with an indescribable expression for looking quite lost in the big carriage sat amy and one young lady  run beth and help hannah clear half the things off the table it will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl cried jo hurrying away to the lower regions too excited to stop even for a laugh  in came amy quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who had kept her promise the rest of the family being of a dramatic turn played their parts equally well and miss eliott found them a most hilarious set for it was impossible to control entirely the merriment which possessed them the remodeled lunch being gaily partaken of the studio and garden visited and art discussed with enthusiasm amy ordered a buggy alas for the elegant cherrybounce and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset when the party went out  as she came walking in looking very tired but as composed as ever she observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had disappeared except a suspicious pucker about the corners of jos mouth  youve had a loverly afternoon for your drive dear said her mother as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come  miss eliott is a very sweet girl and seemed to enjoy herself i thought observed beth with unusual warmth  could you spare me some of your cake i really need some i have so much company and i cant make such delicious stuff as yours asked meg soberly  take it all im the only one here who likes sweet things and it will mold before i can dispose of it answered amy thinking with a sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this  its a pity laurie isnt here to help us began jo as they sat down to ice cream and salad for the second time in two days  a warning look from her mother checked any further remarks and the whole family ate in heroic silence till mr march mildly observed salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients and evelyn here a general explosion of laughter cut short the history of salads to the great surprise of the learned gentleman  bundle everything into a basket and send it to the hummels germans like messes im sick of the sight of this and theres no reason you should all die of a surfeit because ive been a fool cried amy wiping her eyes  i thought i should have died when i saw you two girls rattling about in the whatyoucallit like two little kernels in a very big nutshell and mother waiting in state to receive the throng sighed jo quite spent with laughter  im very sorry you were disappointed dear but we all did our best to satisfy you said mrs march in a tone full of motherly regret  i am satisfied ive done what i undertook and its not my fault that it failed i comfort myself with that said amy with a little quiver in her voice i thank you all very much for helping me and ill thank you still more if you wont allude to it for a month at least  no one did for several months but the word fete always produced a general smile and lauries birthday gift to amy was a tiny coral lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard     chapter twentyseven literary lessons   fortune suddenly smiled upon jo and dropped a good luck penny in her path not a golden penny exactly but i doubt if half a million would have given more real happiness then did the little sum that came to her in this wise  every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room put on her scribbling suit and fall into a vortex as she expressed it writing away at her novel with all her heart and soul for till that was finished she could find no peace her scribbling suit consisted of a black woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will and a cap of the same material adorned with a cheerful red bow into which she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action this cap was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family who during these periods kept their distance merely popping in their heads semioccasionally to ask with interest does genius burn jo they did not always venture even to ask this question but took an observation of the cap and judged accordingly if this expressive article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead it was a sign that hard work was going on in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly askew and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off and cast upon the floor at such times the intruder silently withdrew and not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow did anyone dare address jo  she did not think herself a genius by any means but when the writing fit came on she gave herself up to it with entire abandon and led a blissful life unconscious of want care or bad weather while she sat safe and happy in an imaginary world full of friends almost as real and dear to her as any in the flesh sleep forsook her eyes meals stood untasted day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness which blessed her only at such times and made these hours worth living even if they bore no other fruit the divine afflatus usually lasted a week or two and then she emerged from her vortex hungry sleepy cross or despondent  she was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was prevailed upon to escort miss crocker to a lecture and in return for her virtue was rewarded with a new idea it was a peoples course the lecture on the pyramids and jo rather wondered at the choice of such a subject for such an audience but took it for granted that some great social evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding the glories of the pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy with the price of coal and flour and whose lives were spent in trying to solve harder riddles than that of the sphinx  they were early and while miss crocker set the heel of her stocking jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the seat with them on her left were two matrons with massive foreheads and bonnets to match discussing womens rights and making tatting beyond sat a pair of humble lovers artlessly holding each other by the hand a somber spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag and an old gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna on her right her only neighbor was a studious looking lad absorbed in a newspaper  it was a pictorial sheet and jo examined the work of art nearest her idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed the melodramatic illustration of an indian in full war costume tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat while two infuriated young gentlemen with unnaturally small feet and big eyes were stabbing each other close by and a disheveled female was flying away in the background with her mouth wide open pausing to turn a page the lad saw her looking and with boyish good nature offered half his paper saying bluntly want to read it thats a firstrate story  jo accepted it with a smile for she had never outgrown her liking for lads and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love mystery and murder for the story belonged to that class of light literature in which the passions have a holiday and when the authors invention fails a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the dramatis personae leaving the other half to exult over their downfall  prime isnt it asked the boy as her eye went down the last paragraph of her portion  i think you and i could do as well as that if we tried returned jo amused at his admiration of the trash  i should think i was a pretty lucky chap if i could she makes a good living out of such stories they say and he pointed to the name of mrs slang northbury under the title of the tale  do you know her asked jo with sudden interest  no but i read all her pieces and i know a fellow who works in the office where this paper is printed  do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this and jo looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly sprinkled exclamation points that adorned the page  guess she does she knows just what folks like and gets paid well for writing it  here the lecture began but jo heard very little of it for while professor sands was prosing away about belzoni cheops scarabei and hieroglyphics she was covertly taking down the address of the paper and boldly resolving to try for the hundreddollar prize offered in its columns for a sensational story by the time the lecture ended and the audience awoke she had built up a splendid fortune for herself not the first founded on paper and was already deep in the concoction of her story being unable to decide whether the duel should come before the elopement or after the murder  she said nothing of her plan at home but fell to work next day much to the disquiet of her mother who always looked a little anxious when genius took to burning jo had never tried this style before contenting herself with very mild romances for the spread eagle her experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now for they gave her some idea of dramatic effect and supplied plot language and costumes her story was as full of desperation and despair as her limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to make it and having located it in lisbon she wound up with an earthquake as a striking and appropriate denouement the manuscript was privately dispatched accompanied by a note modestly saying that if the tale didnt get the prize which the writer hardly dared expect she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth  six weeks is a long time to wait and a still longer time for a girl to keep a secret but jo did both and was just beginning to give up all hope of ever seeing her manuscript again when a letter arrived which almost took her breath away for on opening it a check for a hundred dollars fell into her lap for a minute she stared at it as if it had been a snake then she read her letter and began to cry if the amiable gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what intense happiness he was giving a fellow creature i think he would devote his leisure hours if he has any to that amusement for jo valued the letter more than the money because it was encouraging and after years of effort it was so pleasant to find that she had learned to do something though it was only to write a sensation story  a prouder young woman was seldom seen than she when having composed herself she electrified the family by appearing before them with the letter in one hand the check in the other announcing that she had won the prize of course there was a great jubilee and when the story came everyone read and praised it though after her father had told her that the language was good the romance fresh and hearty and the tragedy quite thrilling he shook his head and said in his unworldly way  you can do better than this jo aim at the highest and never mind the money  i think the money is the best part of it what will you do with such a fortune asked amy regarding the magic slip of paper with a reverential eye  send beth and mother to the seaside for a month or two answered jo promptly  to the seaside they went after much discussion and though beth didnt come home as plump and rosy as could be desired she was much better while mrs march declared she felt ten years younger so jo was satisfied with the investment of her prize money and fell to work with a cheery spirit bent on earning more of those delightful checks she did earn several that year and began to feel herself a power in the house for by the magic of a pen her rubbish turned into comforts for them all the dukes daughter paid the butchers bill a phantom hand put down a new carpet and the curse of the coventrys proved the blessing of the marches in the way of groceries and gowns  wealth is certainly a most desirable thing but poverty has its sunny side and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand and to the inspiration of necessity we owe half the wise beautiful and useful blessings of the world jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction and ceased to envy richer girls taking great comfort in the knowledge that she could supply her own wants and need ask no one for a penny  little notice was taken of her stories but they found a market and encouraged by this fact she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame and fortune having copied her novel for the fourth time read it to all her confidential friends and submitted it with fear and trembling to three publishers she at last disposed of it on condition that she would cut it down one third and omit all the parts which she particularly admired  now i must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold pay for printing it myself or chop it up to suit purchasers and get what i can for it fame is a very good thing to have in the house but cash is more convenient so i wish to take the sense of the meeting on this important subject said jo calling a family council  dont spoil your book my girl for there is more in it than you know and the idea is well worked out let it wait and ripen was her fathers advice and he practiced what he preached having waited patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen and being in no haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow  it seems to me that jo will profit more by taking the trial than by waiting said mrs march criticism is the best test of such work for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults and help her to do better next time we are too partial but the praise and blame of outsiders will prove useful even if she gets but little money  yes said jo knitting her brows thats just it ive been fussing over the thing so long i really dont know whether its good bad or indifferent it will be a great help to have cool impartial persons take a look at it and tell me what they think of it  i wouldnt leave a word out of it youll spoil it if you do for the interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the people and it will be all a muddle if you dont explain as you go on said meg who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable novel ever written  but mr allen says leave out the explanations make it brief and dramatic and let the characters tell the story interrupted jo turning to the publishers note  do as he tells you he knows what will sell and we dont make a good popular book and get as much money as you can byandby when youve got a name you can afford to digress and have philosophical and metaphysical people in your novels said amy who took a strictly practical view of the subject  well said jo laughing if my people are philosophical and metaphysical it isnt my fault for i know nothing about such things except what i hear father say sometimes if ive got some of his wise ideas jumbled up with my romance so much the better for me now beth what do you say  i should so like to see it printed soon was all beth said and smiled in saying it but there was an unconscious emphasis on the last word and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike candor which chilled jos heart for a minute with a forboding fear and decided her to make her little venture soon  so with spartan firmness the young authoress laid her firstborn on her table and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre in the hope of pleasing everyone she took everyones advice and like the old man and his donkey in the fable suited nobody  her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got into it so that was allowed to remain though she had her doubts about it her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description out therefore it came and with it many necessary links in the story meg admired the tragedy so jo piled up the agony to suit her while amy objected to the fun and with the best intentions in life jo quenched the spritly scenes which relieved the somber character of the story then to complicate the ruin she cut it down one third and confidingly sent the poor little romance like a picked robin out into the big busy world to try its fate  well it was printed and she got three hundred dollars for it likewise plenty of praise and blame both so much greater than she expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it took her some time to recover  you said mother that criticism would help me but how can it when its so contradictory that i dont know whether ive written a promising book or broken all the ten commandments cried poor jo turning over a heap of notices the perusal of which filled her with pride and joy one minute wrath and dismay the next this man says an exquisite book full of truth beauty and earnestness all is sweet pure and healthy continued the perplexed authoress the next the theory of the book is bad full of morbid fancies spiritualistic ideas and unnatural characters now as i had no theory of any kind dont believe in spiritualism and copied my characters from life i dont see how this critic can be right another says its one of the best american novels which has appeared for years i know better than that and the next asserts that though it is original and written with great force and feeling it is a dangerous book tisnt some make fun of it some overpraise and nearly all insist that i had a deep theory to expound when i only wrote it for the pleasure and the money i wish id printed the whole or not at all for i do hate to be so misjudged  her family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally yet it was a hard time for sensitive highspirited jo who meant so well and had apparently done so ill but it did her good for those whose opinion had real value gave her the criticism which is an authors best education and when the first soreness was over she could laugh at her poor little book yet believe in it still and feel herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had received  not being a genius like keats it wont kill me she said stoutly and ive got the joke on my side after all for the parts that were taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd and the scenes that i made up out of my own silly head are pronounced charmingly natural tender and true so ill comfort myself with that and when im ready ill up again and take another     chapter twentyeight domestic experiences   like most other young matrons meg began her married life with the determination to be a model housekeeper john should find home a paradise he should always see a smiling face should fare sumptuously every day and never know the loss of a button she brought so much love energy and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but succeed in spite of some obstacles her paradise was not a tranquil one for the little woman fussed was overanxious to please and bustled about like a true martha cumbered with many cares she was too tired sometimes even to smile john grew dyspeptic after a course of dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare as for buttons she soon learned to wonder where they went to shake her head over the carelessness of men and to threaten to make him sew them on himself and see if his work would stand impatient and clumsy fingers any better than hers  they were very happy even after they discovered that they couldnt live on love alone john did not find megs beauty diminished though she beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee pot nor did meg miss any of the romance from the daily parting when her husband followed up his kiss with the tender inquiry shall i send some veal or mutton for dinner darling the little house ceased to be a glorified bower but it became a home and the young couple soon felt that it was a change for the better at first they played keephouse and frolicked over it like children then john took steadily to business feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his shoulders and meg laid by her cambric wrappers put on a big apron and fell to work as before said with more energy than discretion  while the cooking mania lasted she went through mrs corneliuss receipt book as if it were a mathematical exercise working out the problems with patience and care sometimes her family were invited in to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes or lotty would be privately dispatched with a batch of failures which were to be concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little hummels an evening with john over the account books usually produced a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm and a frugal fit would ensue during which the poor man was put through a course of bread pudding hash and warmedover coffee which tried his soul although he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude before the golden mean was found however meg added to her domestic possessions what young couples seldom get on long without a family jar  fired with a housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with homemade preserves she undertook to put up her own currant jelly john was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra quantity of sugar for their own currants were ripe and were to be attended to at once as john firmly believed that my wife was equal to anything and took a natural pride in her skill he resolved that she should be gratified and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most pleasing form for winter use home came four dozen delightful little pots half a barrel of sugar and a small boy to pick the currants for her with her pretty hair tucked into a little cap arms bared to the elbow and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the bib the young housewife fell to work feeling no doubts about her success for hadnt she seen hannah do it hundreds of times the array of pots rather amazed her at first but john was so fond of jelly and the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf that meg resolved to fill them all and spent a long day picking boiling straining and fussing over her jelly she did her best she asked advice of mrs cornelius she racked her brain to remember what hannah did that she left undone she reboiled resugared and restrained but that dreadful stuff wouldnt jell  she longed to run home bib and all and ask mother to lend her a hand but john and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone with their private worries experiments or quarrels they had laughed over that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one but they had held to their resolve and whenever they could get on without help they did so and no one interfered for mrs march had advised the plan so meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats all that hot summer day and at five oclock sat down in her topsyturvey kitchen wrung her bedaubed hands lifted up her voice and wept  now in the first flush of the new life she had often said my husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he likes i shall always be prepared there shall be no flurry no scolding no discomfort but a neat house a cheerful wife and a good dinner john dear never stop to ask my leave invite whom you please and be sure of a welcome from me  how charming that was to be sure john quite glowed with pride to hear her say it and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a superior wife but although they had had company from time to time it never happened to be unexpected and meg had never had an opportunity to distinguish herself till now it always happens so in this vale of tears there is an inevitability about such things which we can only wonder at deplore and bear as we best can  if john had not forgotten all about the jelly it really would have been unpardonable in him to choose that day of all the days in the year to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly congratulating himself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning feeling sure that it would be ready to the minute and indulging in pleasant anticipations of the charming effect it would produce when his pretty wife came running out to meet him he escorted his friend to his mansion with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host and husband  it is a world of disappointments as john discovered when he reached the dovecote the front door usually stood hospitably open now it was not only shut but locked and yesterdays mud still adorned the steps the parlor windows were closed and curtained no picture of the pretty wife sewing on the piazza in white with a distracting little bow in her hair or a brighteyed hostess smiling a shy welcome as she greeted her guest nothing of the sort for not a soul appeared but a sanginarylooking boy asleep under the current bushes  im afraid something has happened step into the garden scott while i look up mrs brooke said john alarmed at the silence and solitude  round the house he hurried led by a pungent smell of burned sugar and mr scott strolled after him with a queer look on his face he paused discreetly at a distance when brooke disappeared but he could both see and hear and being a bachelor enjoyed the prospect mightily  in the kitchen reigned confusion and despair one edition of jelly was trickled from pot to pot another lay upon the floor and a third was burning gaily on the stove lotty with teutonic phlegm was calmly eating bread and currant wine for the jelly was still in a hopelessly liquid state while mrs brooke with her apron over her head sat sobbing dismally  my dearest girl what is the matter cried john rushing in with awful visions of scalded hands sudden news of affliction and secret consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden  oh john i am so tired and hot and cross and worried ive been at it till im all worn out do come and help me or i shall die and the exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast giving him a sweet welcome in every sense of the word for her pinafore had been baptized at the same time as the floor  what worries you dear has anything dreadful happened asked the anxious john tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap which was all askew  yes sobbed meg despairingly  tell me quick then dont cry i can bear anything better than that out with it love  the the jelly wont jell and i dont know what to do  john brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward and the derisive scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal which put the finishing stroke to poor megs woe  is that all fling it out of the window and dont bother any more about it ill buy you quarts if you want it but for heavens sake dont have hysterics for ive brought jack scott home to dinner and  john got no further for meg cast him off and clasped her hands with a tragic gesture as she fell into a chair exclaiming in a tone of mingled indignation reproach and dismay  a man to dinner and everything in a mess john brooke how could you do such a thing  hush hes in the garden i forgot the confounded jelly but it cant be helped now said john surveying the prospect with an anxious eye  you ought to have sent word or told me this morning and you ought to have remembered how busy i was continued meg petulantly for even turtledoves will peck when ruffled  i didnt know it this morning and there was no time to send word for i met him on the way out i never thought of asking leave when you have always told me to do as i liked i never tried it before and hang me if i ever do again added john with an aggrieved air  i should hope not take him away at once i cant see him and there isnt any dinner  well i like that wheres the beef and vegetables i sent home and the pudding you promised cried john rushing to the larder  i hadnt time to cook anything i meant to dine at mothers im sorry but i was so busy and megs tears began again  john was a mild man but he was human and after a long days work to come home tired hungry and hopeful to find a chaotic house an empty table and a cross wife was not exactly conducive to repose of mind or manner he restrained himself however and the little squall would have blown over but for one unlucky word  its a scrape i acknowledge but if you will lend a hand well pull through and have a good time yet dont cry dear but just exert yourself a bit and fix us up something to eat were both as hungry as hunters so we shant mind what it is give us the cold meat and bread and cheese we wont ask for jelly  he meant it to be a goodnatured joke but that one word sealed his fate meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure and the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke  you must get yourself out of the scrape as you can im too used up to exert myself for anyone its like a man to propose a bone and vulgar bread and cheese for company i wont have anything of the sort in my house take that scott up to mothers and tell him im away sick dead anything i wont see him and you two can laugh at me and my jelly as much as you like you wont have anything else here and having delivered her defiance all on one breath meg cast away her pinafore and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own room  what those two creatures did in her absence she never knew but mr scott was not taken up to mothers and when meg descended after they had strolled away together she found traces of a promiscuous lunch which filled her with horror lotty reported that they had eaten a much and greatly laughed and the master bid her throw away all the sweet stuff and hide the pots  meg longed to go and tell mother but a sense of shame at her own shortcomings of loyalty to john who might be cruel but nobody should know it restrained her and after a summary cleaning up she dressed herself prettily and sat down to wait for john to come and be forgiven  unfortunately john didnt come not seeing the matter in that light he had carried it off as a good joke with scott excused his little wife as well as he could and played the host so hospitably that his friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner and promised to come again but john was angry though he did not show it he felt that meg had deserted him in his hour of need it wasnt fair to tell a man to bring folks home any time with perfect freedom and when he took you at your word to flame up and blame him and leave him in the lurch to be laughed at or pitied no by george it wasnt and meg must know it  he had fumed inwardly during the feast but when the flurry was over and he strolled home after seeing scott off a milder mood came over him poor little thing it was hard upon her when she tried so heartily to please me she was wrong of course but then she was young i must be patient and teach her he hoped she had not gone homehe hated gossip and interference for a minute he was ruffled again at the mere thought of it and then the fear that meg would cry herself sick softened his heart and sent him on at a quicker pace resolving to be calm and kind but firm quite firm and show her where she had failed in her duty to her spouse  meg likewise resolved to be calm and kind but firm and show him his duty she longed to run to meet him and beg pardon and be kissed and comforted as she was sure of being but of course she did nothing of the sort and when she saw john coming began to hum quite naturally as she rocked and sewed like a lady of leisure in her best parlor  john was a little disappointed not to find a tender niobe but feeling that his dignity demanded the first apology he made none only came leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly relevant remark we are going to have a new moon my dear  ive no objection was megs equally soothing remark a few other topics of general interest were introduced by mr brooke and wetblanketed by mrs brooke and conversation languished john went to one window unfolded his paper and wrapped himself in it figuratively speaking meg went to the other window and sewed as if new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life neither spoke both looked quite calm and firm and both felt desperately uncomfortable  oh dear thought meg married life is very trying and does need infinite patience as well as love as mother says the word mother suggested other maternal counsels given long ago and received with unbelieving protests  john is a good man but he has his faults and you must learn to see and bear with them remembering your own he is very decided but never will be obstinate if you reason kindly not oppose impatiently he is very accurate and particular about the trutha good trait though you call him fussy never deceive him by look or word meg and he will give you the confidence you deserve the support you need he has a temper not like oursone flash and then all overbut the white still anger that is seldom stirred but once kindled is hard to quench be careful be very careful not to wake his anger against yourself for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect watch yourself be the first to ask pardon if you both err and guard against the little piques misunderstandings and hasty words that often pave the way for bitter sorrow and regret  these words came back to meg as she sat sewing in the sunset especially the last this was the first serious disagreement her own hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind as she recalled them her own anger looked childish now and thoughts of poor john coming home to such a scene quite melted her heart she glanced at him with tears in her eyes but he did not see them she put down her work and got up thinking i will be the first to say forgive me but he did not seem to hear her she went very slowly across the room for pride was hard to swallow and stood by him but he did not turn his head for a minute she felt as if she really couldnt do it then came the thought this is the beginning ill do my part and have nothing to reproach myself with and stooping down she softly kissed her husband on the forehead of course that settled it the penitent kiss was better than a world of words and john had her on his knee in a minute saying tenderly  it was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots forgive me dear i never will again  but he did oh bless you yes hundreds of times and so did meg both declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made for family peace was preserved in that little family jar  after this meg had mr scott to dinner by special invitation and served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first course on which occasion she was so gay and gracious and made everything go off so charmingly that mr scott told john he was a lucky fellow and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all the way home  in the autumn new trials and experiences came to meg sallie moffat renewed her friendship was always running out for a dish of gossip at the little house or inviting that poor dear to come in and spend the day at the big house it was pleasant for in dull weather meg often felt lonely all were busy at home john absent till night and nothing to do but sew or read or potter about so it naturally fell out that meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend seeing sallies pretty things made her long for such and pity herself because she had not got them sallie was very kind and often offered her the coveted trifles but meg declined them knowing that john wouldnt like it and then this foolish little woman went and did what john disliked even worse  she knew her husbands income and she loved to feel that he trusted her not only with his happiness but what some men seem to value morehis money she knew where it was was free to take what she liked and all he asked was that she should keep account of every penny pay bills once a month and remember that she was a poor mans wife till now she had done well been prudent and exact kept her little account books neatly and showed them to him monthly without fear but that autumn the serpent got into megs paradise and tempted her like many a modern eve not with apples but with dress meg didnt like to be pitied and made to feel poor it irritated her but she was ashamed to confess it and now and then she tried to console herself by buying something pretty so that sallie neednt think she had to economize she always felt wicked after it for the pretty things were seldom necessaries but then they cost so little it wasnt worth worrying about so the trifles increased unconsciously and in the shopping excursions she was no longer a passive lookeron  but the trifles cost more than one would imagine and when she cast up her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her john was busy that month and left the bills to her the next month he was absent but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up and meg never forgot it a few days before she had done a dreadful thing and it weighed upon her conscience sallie had been buying silks and meg longed for a new one just a handsome light one for parties her black silk was so common and thin things for evening wear were only proper for girls aunt march usually gave the sisters a present of twentyfive dollars apiece at new years that was only a month to wait and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain and she had the money if she only dared to take it john always said what was his was hers but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective fiveandtwenty but another fiveandtwenty out of the household fund that was the question sallie had urged her to do it had offered to lend the money and with the best intentions in life had tempted meg beyond her strength in an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely shimmering folds and said a bargain i assure you maam she answered ill take it and it was cut off and paid for and sallie had exulted and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no consequence and driven away feeling as if she had stolen something and the police were after her  when she got home she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by spreading forth the lovely silk but it looked less silvery now didnt become her after all and the words fifty dollars seemed stamped like a pattern down each breadth she put it away but it haunted her not delightfully as a new dress should but dreadfully like the ghost of a folly that was not easily laid when john got out his books that night megs heart sank and for the first time in her married life she was afraid of her husband the kind brown eyes looked as if they could be stern and though he was unusually merry she fancied he had found her out but didnt mean to let her know it the house bills were all paid the books all in order john had praised her and was undoing the old pocketbook which they called the bank when meg knowing that it was quite empty stopped his hand saying nervously  you havent seen my private expense book yet  john never asked to see it but she always insisted on his doing so and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women wanted and made him guess what piping was demand fiercely the meaning of a hugmetight or wonder how a little thing composed of three rosebuds a bit of velvet and a pair of strings could possibly be a bonnet and cost six dollars that night he looked as if he would like the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her extravagance as he often did being particularly proud of his prudent wife  the little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him meg got behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles out of his tired forehead and standing there she said with her panic increasing with every word  john dear im ashamed to show you my book for ive really been dreadfully extravagant lately i go about so much i must have things you know and sallie advised my getting it so i did and my new years money will partly pay for it but i was sorry after i had done it for i knew youd think it wrong in me  john laughed and drew her round beside him saying goodhumoredly dont go and hide i wont beat you if you have got a pair of killing boots im rather proud of my wifes feet and dont mind if she does pay eight or nine dollars for her boots if they are good ones  that had been one of her last trifles and johns eye had fallen on it as he spoke oh what will he say when he comes to that awful fifty dollars thought meg with a shiver  its worse than boots its a silk dress she said with the calmness of desperation for she wanted the worst over  well dear what is the demd total as mr mantalini says  that didnt sound like john and she knew he was looking up at her with the straightforward look that she had always been ready to meet and answer with one as frank till now she turned the page and her head at the same time pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough without the fifty but which was appalling to her with that added for a minute the room was very still then john said slowlybut she could feel it cost him an effort to express no displeasure    well i dont know that fifty is much for a dress with all the furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days  it isnt made or trimmed sighed meg faintly for a sudden recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her  twentyfive yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman but ive no doubt my wife will look as fine as ned moffats when she gets it on said john dryly  i know you are angry john but i cant help it i dont mean to waste your money and i didnt think those little things would count up so i cant resist them when i see sallie buying all she wants and pitying me because i dont i try to be contented but it is hard and im tired of being poor  the last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them but he did and they wounded him deeply for he had denied himself many pleasures for megs sake she could have bitten her tongue out the minute she had said it for john pushed the books away and got up saying with a little quiver in his voice i was afraid of this i do my best meg if he had scolded her or even shaken her it would not have broken her heart like those few words she ran to him and held him close crying with repentant tears oh john my dear kind hardworking boy i didnt mean it it was so wicked so untrue and ungrateful how could i say it oh how could i say it  he was very kind forgave her readily and did not utter one reproach but meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be forgotten soon although he might never allude to it again she had promised to love him for better or worse and then she his wife had reproached him with his poverty after spending his earnings recklessly it was dreadful and the worst of it was john went on so quietly afterward just as if nothing had happened except that he stayed in town later and worked at night when she had gone to cry herself to sleep a week of remorse nearly made meg sick and the discovery that john had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat reduced her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold he had simply said in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change i cant afford it my dear  meg said no more but a few minutes after he found her in the hall with her face buried in the old greatcoat crying as if her heart would break  they had a long talk that night and meg learned to love her husband better for his poverty because it seemed to have made a man of him given him the strength and courage to fight his own way and taught him a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings and failures of those he loved  next day she put her pride in her pocket went to sallie told the truth and asked her to buy the silk as a favor the goodnatured mrs moffat willingly did so and had the delicacy not to make her a present of it immediately afterward then meg ordered home the greatcoat and when john arrived she put it on and asked him how he liked her new silk gown one can imagine what answer he made how he received his present and what a blissful state of things ensued john came home early meg gadded no more and that greatcoat was put on in the morning by a very happy husband and taken off at night by a most devoted little wife so the year rolled round and at midsummer there came to meg a new experience the deepest and tenderest of a womans life  laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the dovecote one saturday with an excited face and was received with the clash of cymbals for hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the other  hows the little mamma where is everybody why didnt you tell me before i came home began laurie in a loud whisper  happy as a queen the dear every soul of em is upstairs a worshipin we didnt want no hurrycanes round now you go into the parlor and ill send em down to you with which somewhat involved reply hannah vanished chuckling ecstatically  presently jo appeared proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon a large pillow jos face was very sober but her eyes twinkled and there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed emotion of some sort  shut your eyes and hold out your arms she said invitingly  laurie backed precipitately into a corner and put his hands behind him with an imploring gesture no thank you id rather not i shall drop it or smash it as sure as fate  then you shant see your nevvy said jo decidedly turning as if to go  i will i will only you must be responsible for damages and obeying orders laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put into his arms a peal of laughter from jo amy mrs march hannah and john caused him to open them the next minute to find himself invested with two babies instead of one  no wonder they laughed for the expression of his face was droll enough to convulse a quaker as he stood and stared wildly from the unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that jo sat down on the floor and screamed  twins by jupiter was all he said for a minute then turning to the women with an appealing look that was comically piteous he added take em quick somebody im going to laugh and i shall drop em  jo rescued his babies and marched up and down with one on each arm as if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending while laurie laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks  its the best joke of the season isnt it i wouldnt have told you for i set my heart on surprising you and i flatter myself ive done it said jo when she got her breath  i never was more staggered in my life isnt it fun are they boys what are you going to name them lets have another look hold me up jo for upon my life its one too many for me returned laurie regarding the infants with the air of a big benevolent newfoundland looking at a pair of infantile kittens  boy and girl arent they beauties said the proud papa beaming upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels  most remarkable children i ever saw which is which and laurie bent like a wellsweep to examine the prodigies  amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl french fashion so you can always tell besides one has blue eyes and one brown kiss them uncle teddy said wicked jo  im afraid they mightnt like it began laurie with unusual timidity in such matters  of course they will they are used to it now do it this minute sir commanded jo fearing he might propose a proxy  laurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each little cheek that produced another laugh and made the babies squeal  there i knew they didnt like it thats the boy see him kick he hits out with his fists like a good one now then young brooke pitch into a man of your own size will you cried laurie delighted with a poke in the face from a tiny fist flapping aimlessly about  hes to be named john laurence and the girl margaret after mother and grandmother we shall call her daisey so as not to have two megs and i suppose the mannie will be jack unless we find a better name said amy with auntlike interest  name him demijohn and call him demi for short said laurie  daisy and demi just the thing i knew teddy would do it cried jo clapping her hands  teddy certainly had done it that time for the babies were daisy and demi to the end of the chapter     chapter twentynine calls   come jo its time  for what  you dont mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half a dozen calls with me today  ive done a good many rash and foolish things in my life but i dont think i ever was mad enough to say id make six calls in one day when a single one upsets me for a week  yes you did it was a bargain between us i was to finish the crayon of beth for you and you were to go properly with me and return our neighbors visits  if it was fair that was in the bond and i stand to the letter of my bond shylock there is a pile of clouds in the east its not fair and i dont go  now thats shirking its a lovely day no prospect of rain and you pride yourself on keeping promises so be honorable come and do your duty and then be at peace for another six months  at that minute jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking for she was mantuamaker general to the family and took especial credit to herself because she could use a needle as well as a pen it was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first tryingon and ordered out to make calls in her best array on a warm july day she hated calls of the formal sort and never made any till amy compelled her with a bargain bribe or promise in the present instance there was no escape and having clashed her scissors rebelliously while protesting that she smelled thunder she gave in put away her work and taking up her hat and gloves with an air of resignation told amy the victim was ready  jo march you are perverse enough to provoke a saint you dont intend to make calls in that state i hope cried amy surveying her with amazement  why not im neat and cool and comfortable quite proper for a dusty walk on a warm day if people care more for my clothes than they do for me i dont wish to see them you can dress for both and be as elegant as you please it pays for you to be fine it doesnt for me and furbelows only worry me  oh dear sighed amy now shes in a contrary fit and will drive me distracted before i can get her properly ready im sure its no pleasure to me to go today but its a debt we owe society and theres no one to pay it but you and me ill do anything for you jo if youll only dress yourself nicely and come and help me do the civil you can talk so well look so aristocratic in your best things and behave so beautifully if you try that im proud of you im afraid to go alone do come and take care of me  youre an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old sister in that way the idea of my being aristocratic and wellbred and your being afraid to go anywhere alone i dont know which is the most absurd well ill go if i must and do my best you shall be commander of the expedition and ill obey blindly will that satisfy you said jo with a sudden change from perversity to lamblike submission  youre a perfect cherub now put on all your best things and ill tell you how to behave at each place so that you will make a good impression i want people to like you and they would if youd only try to be a little more agreeable do your hair the pretty way and put the pink rose in your bonnet its becoming and you look too sober in your plain suit take your light gloves and the embroidered handkerchief well stop at megs and borrow her white sunshade and then you can have my dovecolored one  while amy dressed she issued her orders and jo obeyed them not without entering her protest however for she sighed as she rustled into her new organdie frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow wrestled viciously with pins as she put on her collar wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out the handkerchief whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the present mission was to her feelings and when she had squeezed her hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel as the last touch of elegance she turned to amy with an imbecile expression of countenance saying meekly  im perfectly miserable but if you consider me presentable i die happy  youre highly satisfactory turn slowly round and let me get a careful view jo revolved and amy gave a touch here and there then fell back with her head on one side observing graciously yes youll do your head is all i could ask for that white bonnet with the rose is quite ravishing hold back your shoulders and carry your hands easily no matter if your gloves do pinch theres one thing you can do well jo that is wear a shawl i cant but its very nice to see you and im so glad aunt march gave you that lovely one its simple but handsome and those folds over the arm are really artistic is the point of my mantle in the middle and have i looped my dress evenly i like to show my boots for my feet are pretty though my nose isnt  you are a thing of beauty and a joy forever said jo looking through her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the golden hair am i to drag my best dress through the dust or loop it up please maam  hold it up when you walk but drop it in the house the sweeping style suits you best and you must learn to trail your skirts gracefully you havent half buttoned one cuff do it at once youll never look finished if you are not careful about the little details for they make up the pleasing whole  jo sighed and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove in doing up her cuff but at last both were ready and sailed away looking as pretty as picters hannah said as she hung out of the upper window to watch them  now jo dear the chesters consider themselves very elegant people so i want you to put on your best deportment dont make any of your abrupt remarks or do anything odd will you just be calm cool and quiet thats safe and ladylike and you can easily do it for fifteen minutes said amy as they approached the first place having borrowed the white parasol and been inspected by meg with a baby on each arm  let me see calm cool and quiet yes i think i can promise that ive played the part of a prim young lady on the stage and ill try it off my powers are great as you shall see so be easy in your mind my child  amy looked relieved but naughty jo took her at her word for during the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed every fold correctly draped calm as a summer sea cool as a snowbank and as silent as the sphinx in vain mrs chester alluded to her charming novel and the misses chester introduced parties picnics the opera and the fashions each and all were answered by a smile a bow and a demure yes or no with the chill on in vain amy telegraphed the word talk tried to draw her out and administered covert pokes with her foot jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all with deportment like mauds face icily regular splendidly null  what a haughty uninteresting creature that oldest miss march is was the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies as the door closed upon their guests jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall but amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions and very naturally laid the blame upon jo  how could you mistake me so i merely meant you to be properly dignified and composed and you made yourself a perfect stock and stone try to be sociable at the lambs gossip as other girls do and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes up they move in the best society are valuable persons for us to know and i wouldnt fail to make a good impression there for anything  ill be agreeable ill gossip and giggle and have horrors and raptures over any trifle you like i rather enjoy this and now ill imitate what is called a charming girl i can do it for i have may chester as a model and ill improve upon her see if the lambs dont say what a lively nice creature that jo march is  amy felt anxious as well she might for when jo turned freakish there was no knowing where she would stop amys face was a study when she saw her sister skim into the next drawing room kiss all the young ladies with effusion beam graciously upon the young gentlemen and join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder amy was taken possession of by mrs lamb with whom she was a favorite and forced to hear a long account of lucretias last attack while three delightful young gentlemen hovered near waiting for a pause when they might rush in and rescue her so situated she was powerless to check jo who seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief and talked away as volubly as the lady a knot of heads gathered about her and amy strained her ears to hear what was going on for broken sentences filled her with curiosity and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the fun one may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this sort of conversation  she rides splendidly who taught her  no one she used to practice mounting holding the reins and sitting straight on an old saddle in a tree now she rides anything for she doesnt know what fear is and the stableman lets her have horses cheap because she trains them to carry ladies so well she has such a passion for it i often tell her if everything else fails she can be a horsebreaker and get her living so  at this awful speech amy contained herself with difficulty for the impression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady which was her especial aversion but what could she do for the old lady was in the middle of her story and long before it was done jo was off again making more droll revelations and committing still more fearful blunders  yes amy was in despair that day for all the good beasts were gone and of three left one was lame one blind and the other so balky that you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start nice animal for a pleasure party wasnt it  which did she choose asked one of the laughing gentlemen who enjoyed the subject  none of them she heard of a young horse at the farm house over the river and though a lady had never ridden him she resolved to try because he was handsome and spirited her struggles were really pathetic there was no one to bring the horse to the saddle so she took the saddle to the horse my dear creature she actually rowed it over the river put it on her head and marched up to the barn to the utter amazement of the old man  did she ride the horse  of course she did and had a capital time i expected to see her brought home in fragments but she managed him perfectly and was the life of the party  well i call that plucky and young mr lamb turned an approving glance upon amy wondering what his mother could be saying to make the girl look so red and uncomfortable  she was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after when a sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress one of the young ladies asked jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore to the picnic and stupid jo instead of mentioning the place where it was bought two years ago must needs answer with unnecessary frankness oh amy painted it you cant buy those soft shades so we paint ours any color we like its a great comfort to have an artistic sister  isnt that an original idea cried miss lamb who found jo great fun  thats nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances theres nothing the child cant do why she wanted a pair of blue boots for sallies party so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest shade of sky blue you ever saw and they looked exactly like satin added jo with an air of pride in her sisters accomplishments that exasperated amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her cardcase at her  we read a story of yours the other day and enjoyed it very much observed the elder miss lamb wishing to compliment the literary lady who did not look the character just then it must be confessed  any mention of her works always had a bad effect upon jo who either grew rigid and looked offended or changed the subject with a brusque remark as now sorry you could find nothing better to read i write that rubbish because it sells and ordinary people like it are you going to new york this winter  as miss lamb had enjoyed the story this speech was not exactly grateful or complimentary the minute it was made jo saw her mistake but fearing to make the matter worse suddenly remembered that it was for her to make the first move toward departure and did so with an abruptness that left three people with halffinished sentences in their mouths  amy we must go goodby dear do come and see us we are pining for a visit i dont dare to ask you mr lamb but if you should come i dont think i shall have the heart to send you away  jo said this with such a droll imitation of may chesters gushing style that amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible feeling a strong desire to laugh and cry at the same time  didnt i do well asked jo with a satisfied air as they walked away  nothing could have been worse was amys crushing reply what possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle and the hats and boots and all the rest of it  why its funny and amuses people they know we are poor so its no use pretending that we have grooms buy three or four hats a season and have things as easy and fine as they do  you neednt go and tell them all our little shifts and expose our poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way you havent a bit of proper pride and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to speak said amy despairingly  poor jo looked abashed and silently chafed the end of her nose with the stiff handkerchief as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors  how shall i behave here she asked as they approached the third mansion  just as you please i wash my hands of you was amys short answer  then ill enjoy myself the boys are at home and well have a comfortable time goodness knows i need a little change for elegance has a bad effect upon my constitution returned jo gruffly being disturbed by her failure to suit  an enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children speedily soothed her ruffled feelings and leaving amy to entertain the hostess and mr tudor who happened to be calling likewise jo devoted herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing she listened to college stories with deep interest caressed pointers and poodles without a murmur agreed heartily that tom brown was a brick regardless of the improper form of praise and when one lad proposed a visit to his turtle tank she went with an alacrity which caused mamma to smile upon her as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left in a ruinous condition by filial hugs bearlike but affectionate and dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an inspired frenchwoman  leaving her sister to her own devices amy proceeded to enjoy herself to her hearts content mr tudors uncle had married an english lady who was third cousin to a living lord and amy regarded the whole family with great respect for in spite of her american birth and breeding she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best of usthat unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming of a royal yellowhaired laddie some years ago and which still has something to do with the love the young country bears the old like that of a big son for an imperious little mother who held him while she could and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled but even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the british nobility did not render amy forgetful of time and when the proper number of minutes had passed she reluctantly tore herself from this aristocratic society and looked about for jo fervently hoping that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which should bring disgrace upon the name of march  it might have been worse but amy considered it bad for jo sat on the grass with an encampment of boys about her and a dirtyfooted dog reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress as she related one of lauries pranks to her admiring audience one small child was poking turtles with amys cherished parasol a second was eating gingerbread over jos best bonnet and a third playing ball with her gloves but all were enjoying themselves and when jo collected her damaged property to go her escort accompanied her begging her to come again it was such fun to hear about lauries larks  capital boys arent they i feel quite young and brisk again after that said jo strolling along with her hands behind her partly from habit partly to conceal the bespattered parasol  why do you always avoid mr tudor asked amy wisely refraining from any comment upon jos dilapidated appearance  dont like him he puts on airs snubs his sisters worries his father and doesnt speak respectfully of his mother laurie says he is fast and i dont consider him a desirable acquaintance so i let him alone  you might treat him civilly at least you gave him a cool nod and just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to tommy chamberlain whose father keeps a grocery store if you had just reversed the nod and the bow it would have been right said amy reprovingly  no it wouldnt returned jo i neither like respect nor admire tudor though his grandfathers uncles nephews niece was a third cousin to a lord tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever i think well of him and like to show that i do for he is a gentleman in spite of the brown paper parcels  its no use trying to argue with you began amy  not the least my dear interrupted jo so let us look amiable and drop a card here as the kings are evidently out for which im deeply grateful  the family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on and jo uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house and being told that the young ladies were engaged  now let us go home and never mind aunt march today we can run down there any time and its really a pity to trail through the dust in our best bibs and tuckers when we are tired and cross  speak for yourself if you please aunt march likes to have us pay her the compliment of coming in style and making a formal call its a little thing to do but it gives her pleasure and i dont believe it will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping boys spoil them stoop down and let me take the crumbs off of your bonnet  what a good girl you are amy said jo with a repentant glance from her own damaged costume to that of her sister which was fresh and spotless still i wish it was as easy for me to do little things to please people as it is for you i think of them but it takes too much time to do them so i wait for a chance to confer a great favor and let the small ones slip but they tell best in the end i fancy  amy smiled and was mollified at once saying with a maternal air women should learn to be agreeable particularly poor ones for they have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive if youd remember that and practice it youd be better liked than i am because there is more of you  im a crotchety old thing and always shall be but im willing to own that you are right only its easier for me to risk my life for a person than to be pleasant to him when i dont feel like it its a great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes isnt it  its a greater not to be able to hide them i dont mind saying that i dont approve of tudor any more than you do but im not called upon to tell him so neither are you and there is no use in making yourself disagreeable because he is  but i think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men and how can they do it except by their manners preaching does not do any good as i know to my sorrow since ive had teddie to manage but there are many little ways in which i can influence him without a word and i say we ought to do it to others if we can  teddy is a remarkable boy and cant be taken as a sample of other boys said amy in a tone of solemn conviction which would have convulsed the remarkable boy if he had heard it if we were belles or women of wealth and position we might do something perhaps but for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we dont approve of them and smile upon another set because we do wouldnt have a particle of effect and we should only be considered odd and puritanical  so we are to countenance things and people which we detest merely because we are not belles and millionaires are we thats a nice sort of morality  i cant argue about it i only know that its the way of the world and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their pains i dont like reformers and i hope you never try to be one  i do like them and i shall be one if i can for in spite of the laughing the world would never get on without them we cant agree about that for you belong to the old set and i to the new you will get on the best but i shall have the liveliest time of it i should rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting i think  well compose yourself now and dont worry aunt with your new ideas  ill try not to but im always possessed to burst out with some particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her its my doom and i cant help it  they found aunt carrol with the old lady both absorbed in some very interesting subject but they dropped it as the girls came in with a conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their nieces jo was not in a good humor and the perverse fit returned but amy who had virtuously done her duty kept her temper and pleased everybody was in a most angelic frame of mind this amiable spirit was felt at once and both aunts my deared her affectionately looking what they afterward said emphatically that child improves every day  are you going to help about the fair dear asked mrs carrol as amy sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like so well in the young  yes aunt mrs chester asked me if i would and i offered to tend a table as i have nothing but my time to give  im not put in jo decidedly i hate to be patronized and the chesters think its a great favor to allow us to help with their highly connected fair i wonder you consented amy they only want you to work  i am willing to work its for the freedmen as well as the chesters and i think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant  quite right and proper i like your grateful spirit my dear its a pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts some do not and that is trying observed aunt march looking over her spectacles at jo who sat apart rocking herself with a somewhat morose expression  if jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance for one of them she would have turned dovelike in a minute but unfortunately we dont have windows in our breasts and cannot see what goes on in the minds of our friends better for us that we cannot as a general thing but now and then it would be such a comfort such a saving of time and temper by her next speech jo deprived herself of several years of pleasure and received a timely lesson in the art of holding her tongue  i dont like favors they oppress and make me feel like a slave id rather do everything for myself and be perfectly independent  ahem coughed aunt carrol softly with a look at aunt march  i told you so said aunt march with a decided nod to aunt carrol  mercifully unconscious of what she had done jo sat with her nose in the air and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting  do you speak french dear asked mrs carrol laying a hand on amys  pretty well thanks to aunt march who lets esther talk to me as often as i like replied amy with a grateful look which caused the old lady to smile affably  how are you about languages asked mrs carrol of jo  dont know a word im very stupid about studying anything cant bear french its such a slippery silly sort of language was the brusque reply  another look passed between the ladies and aunt march said to amy you are quite strong and well now dear i believe eyes dont trouble you any more do they  not at all thank you maam im very well and mean to do great things next winter so that i may be ready for rome whenever that joyful time arrives  good girl you deserve to go and im sure you will some day said aunt march with an approving pat on the head as amy picked up her ball for her  crosspatch draw the latch sit by the fire and spin   squalled polly bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to peep into jos face with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry that it was impossible to help laughing  most observing bird said the old lady  come and take a walk my dear cried polly hopping toward the china closet with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar  thank you i will come amy and jo brought the visit to an end feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon her constitution she shook hands in a gentlemanly manner but amy kissed both the aunts and the girls departed leaving behind them the impression of shadow and sunshine which impression caused aunt march to say as they vanished  youd better do it mary ill supply the money and aunt carrol to reply decidedly i certainly will if her father and mother consent     chapter thirty consequences   mrs chesters fair was so very elegant and select that it was considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be invited to take a table and everyone was much interested in the matter amy was asked but jo was not which was fortunate for all parties as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily the haughty uninteresting creature was let severely alone but amys talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the art table and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable contributions to it  everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost impossible to avoid when some fiveandtwenty women old and young with all their private piques and prejudices try to work together  may chester was rather jealous of amy because the latter was a greater favorite than herself and just at this time several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling amys dainty penandink work entirely eclipsed mays painted vasesthat was one thorn then the all conquering tudor had danced four times with amy at a late party and only once with maythat was thorn number two but the chief grievance that rankled in her soul and gave an excuse for her unfriendly conduct was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered to her that the march girls had made fun of her at the lambs all the blame of this should have fallen upon jo for her naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection and the frolicsome lambs had permitted the joke to escape no hint of this had reached the culprits however and amys dismay can be imagined when the very evening before the fair as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table mrs chester who of course resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter said in a bland tone but with a cold look  i find dear that there is some feeling among the young ladies about my giving this table to anyone but my girls as this is the most prominent and some say the most attractive table of all and they are the chief gettersup of the fair it is thought best for them to take this place im sorry but i know you are too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a little personal disappointment and you shall have another table if you like  mrs chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this little speech but when the time came she found it rather difficult to utter it naturally with amys unsuspicious eyes looking straight at her full of surprise and trouble  amy felt that there was something behind this but could not guess what and said quietly feeling hurt and showing that she did perhaps you had rather i took no table at all  now my dear dont have any ill feeling i beg its merely a matter of expediency you see my girls will naturally take the lead and this table is considered their proper place i think it very appropriate to you and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty but we must give up our private wishes of course and i will see that you have a good place elsewhere wouldnt you like the flower table the little girls undertook it but they are discouraged you could make a charming thing of it and the flower table is always attractive you know  especially to gentlemen added may with a look which enlightened amy as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor she colored angrily but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm and answered with unexpected amiability  it shall be as you please mrs chester ill give up my place here at once and attend to the flowers if you like  you can put your own things on your own table if you prefer began may feeling a little consciencestricken as she looked at the pretty racks the painted shells and quaint illuminations amy had so carefully made and so gracefully arranged she meant it kindly but amy mistook her meaning and said quickly  oh certainly if they are in your way and sweeping her contributions into her apron pellmell she walked off feeling that herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness  now shes mad oh dear i wish i hadnt asked you to speak mama said may looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table  girls quarrels are soon over returned her mother feeling a trifle ashamed of her own part in this one as well she might  the little girls hailed amy and her treasures with delight which cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit and she fell to work determined to succeed florally if she could not artistically but everything seemed against her it was late and she was tired everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her and the little girls were only hindrances for the dears fussed and chattered like so many magpies making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order the evergreen arch wouldnt stay firm after she got it up but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled her best tile got a splash of water which left a sepia tear on the cupids cheek she bruised her hands with hammering and got cold working in a draft which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor amy and wish her well through her task  there was great indignation at home when she told her story that evening her mother said it was a shame but told her she had done right beth declared she wouldnt go to the fair at all and jo demanded why she didnt take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to get on without her  because they are mean is no reason why i should be i hate such things and though i think ive a right to be hurt i dont intend to show it they will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy actions wont they marmee  thats the right spirit my dear a kiss for a blow is always best though its not very easy to give it sometimes said her mother with the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and practicing  in spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate amy adhered to her resolution all the next day bent on conquering her enemy by kindness she began well thanks to a silent reminder that came to her unexpectedly but most opportunely as she arranged her table that morning while the little girls were in the anteroom filling the baskets she took up her pet production a little book the antique cover of which her father had found among his treasures and in which on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts as she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable pride her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet blue and gold with little spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns and flowers were the words thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself  i ought but i dont thought amy as her eye went from the bright page to mays discontented face behind the big vases that could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled amy stood a minute turning the leaves in her hand reading on each some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street school office or home even a fair table may become a pulpit if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season amys conscience preached her a little sermon from that text then and there and she did what many of us do not always do took the sermon to heart and straightway put it in practice  a group of girls were standing about mays table admiring the pretty things and talking over the change of saleswomen they dropped their voices but amy knew they were speaking of her hearing one side of the story and judging accordingly it was not pleasant but a better spirit had come over her and presently a chance offered for proving it she heard may say sorrowfully  its too bad for there is no time to make other things and i dont want to fill up with odds and ends the table was just complete then now its spoiled  i dare say shed put them back if you asked her suggested someone  how could i after all the fuss began may but she did not finish for amys voice came across the hall saying pleasantly  you may have them and welcome without asking if you want them i was just thinking id offer to put them back for they belong to your table rather than mine here they are please take them and forgive me if i was hasty in carrying them away last night  as she spoke amy returned her contribution with a nod and a smile and hurried away again feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it  now i call that lovely of her dont you cried one girl  mays answer was inaudible but another young lady whose temper was evidently a little soured by making lemonade added with a disagreeable laugh very lovely for she knew she wouldnt sell them at her own table  now that was hard when we make little sacrifices we like to have them appreciated at least and for a minute amy was sorry she had done it feeling that virtue was not always its own reward but it is as she presently discovered for her spirits began to rise and her table to blossom under her skillful hands the girls were very kind and that one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly  it was a very long day and a hard one for amy as she sat behind her table often quite alone for the little girls deserted very soon few cared to buy flowers in summer and her bouquets began to droop long before night  the art table was the most attractive in the room there was a crowd about it all day long and the tenders were constantly flying to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes amy often looked wistfully across longing to be there where she felt at home and happy instead of in a corner with nothing to do it might seem no hardship to some of us but to a pretty blithe young girl it was not only tedious but very trying and the thought of laurie and his friends made it a real martyrdom  she did not go home till night and then she looked so pale and quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one though she made no complaint and did not even tell what she had done her mother gave her an extra cordial cup of tea beth helped her dress and made a charming little wreath for her hair while jo astonished her family by getting herself up with unusual care and hinting darkly that the tables were about to be turned  dont do anything rude pray jo i wont have any fuss made so let it all pass and behave yourself begged amy as she departed early hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little table  i merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one i know and to keep them in your corner as long as possible teddy and his boys will lend a hand and well have a good time yet returned jo leaning over the gate to watch for laurie presently the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk and she ran out to meet him  is that my boy  as sure as this is my girl and laurie tucked her hand under his arm with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified  oh teddy such doings and jo told amys wrongs with sisterly zeal  a flock of our fellows are going to drive over byandby and ill be hanged if i dont make them buy every flower shes got and camp down before her table afterward said laurie espousing her cause with warmth  the flowers are not at all nice amy says and the fresh ones may not arrive in time i dont wish to be unjust or suspicious but i shouldnt wonder if they never came at all when people do one mean thing they are very likely to do another observed jo in a disgusted tone  didnt hayes give you the best out of our gardens i told him to  i didnt know that he forgot i suppose and as your grandpa was poorly i didnt like to worry him by asking though i did want some  now jo how could you think there was any need of asking they are just as much yours as mine dont we always go halves in everything began laurie in the tone that always made jo turn thorny  gracious i hope not half of some of your things wouldnt suit me at all but we mustnt stand philandering here ive got to help amy so you go and make yourself splendid and if youll be so very kind as to let hayes take a few nice flowers up to the hall ill bless you forever  couldnt you do it now asked laurie so suggestively that jo shut the gate in his face with inhospitable haste and called through the bars go away teddy im busy  thanks to the conspirators the tables were turned that night for hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers with a lovely basket arranged in his best manner for a centerpiece then the march family turned out en masse and jo exerted herself to some purpose for people not only came but stayed laughing at her nonsense admiring amys taste and apparently enjoying themselves very much laurie and his friends gallantly threw themselves into the breach bought up the bouquets encamped before the table and made that corner the liveliest spot in the room amy was in her element now and out of gratitude if nothing more was as spritely and gracious as possible coming to the conclusion about that time that virtue was its own reward after all  jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety and when amy was happily surrounded by her guard of honor jo circulated about the hall picking up various bits of gossip which enlightened her upon the subject of the chester change of base she reproached herself for her share of the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate amy as soon as possible she also discovered what amy had done about the things in the morning and considered her a model of magnanimity as she passed the art table she glanced over it for her sisters things but saw no sign of them tucked away out of sight i dare say thought jo who could forgive her own wrongs but hotly resented any insult offered her family  good evening miss jo how does amy get on asked may with a conciliatory air for she wanted to show that she also could be generous  she has sold everything she had that was worth selling and now she is enjoying herself the flower table is always attractive you know especially to gentlemen jo couldnt resist giving that little slap but may took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after and fell to praising the great vases which still remained unsold  is amys illumination anywhere about i took a fancy to buy that for father said jo very anxious to learn the fate of her sisters work  everything of amys sold long ago i took care that the right people saw them and they made a nice little sum of money for us returned may who had overcome sundry small temptations as well as amy had that day  much gratified jo rushed back to tell the good news and amy looked both touched and surprised by the report of mays word and manner  now gentlemen i want you to go and do your duty by the other tables as generously as you have by mine especially the art table she said ordering out teddys own as the girls called the college friends  charge chester charge is the motto for that table but do your duty like men and youll get your moneys worth of art in every sense of the word said the irrepressible jo as the devoted phalanx prepared to take the field  to hear is to obey but march is fairer far than may said little parker making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender and getting promptly quenched by laurie who said  very well my son for a small boy and walked him off with a paternal pat on the head  buy the vases whispered amy to laurie as a final heaping of coals of fire on her enemys head  to mays great delight mr laurence not only bought the vases but pervaded the hall with one under each arm the other gentlemen speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles and wandered helplessly about afterward burdened with wax flowers painted fans filigree portfolios and other useful and appropriate purchases  aunt carrol was there heard the story looked pleased and said something to mrs march in a corner which made the latter lady beam with satisfaction and watch amy with a face full of mingled pride and anxiety though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till several days later  the fair was pronounced a success and when may bade amy goodnight she did not gush as usual but gave her an affectionate kiss and a look which said forgive and forget that satisfied amy and when she got home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a great bouquet in each the reward of merit for a magnanimous march as laurie announced with a flourish  youve a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character than i ever gave you credit for amy youve behaved sweetly and i respect you with all my heart said jo warmly as they brushed their hair together late that night  yes we all do and love her for being so ready to forgive it must have been dreadfully hard after working so long and setting your heart on selling your own pretty things i dont believe i could have done it as kindly as you did added beth from her pillow  why girls you neednt praise me so i only did as id be done by you laugh at me when i say i want to be a lady but i mean a true gentlewoman in mind and manners and i try to do it as far as i know how i cant explain exactly but i want to be above the little meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women im far from it now but i do my best and hope in time to be what mother is  amy spoke earnestly and jo said with a cordial hug i understand now what you mean and ill never laugh at you again you are getting on faster than you think and ill take lessons of you in true politeness for youve learned the secret i believe try away deary youll get your reward some day and no one will be more delighted than i shall  a week later amy did get her reward and poor jo found it hard to be delighted a letter came from aunt carrol and mrs marchs face was illuminated to such a degree when she read it that jo and beth who were with her demanded what the glad tidings were  aunt carrol is going abroad next month and wants  me to go with her burst in jo flying out of her chair in an uncontrollable rapture  no dear not you its amy  oh mother shes too young its my turn first ive wanted it so long it would do me so much good and be so altogether splendid i must go  im afraid its impossible jo aunt says amy decidedly and it is not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor  its always so amy has all the fun and i have all the work it isnt fair oh it isnt fair cried jo passionately  im afraid its partly your own fault dear when aunt spoke to me the other day she regretted your blunt manners and too independent spirit and here she writes as if quoting something you had saidi planned at first to ask jo but as favors burden her and she hates french i think i wont venture to invite her amy is more docile will make a good companion for flo and receive gratefully any help the trip may give her  oh my tongue my abominable tongue why cant i learn to keep it quiet groaned jo remembering words which had been her undoing when she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases mrs march said sorrowfully  i wish you could have gone but there is no hope of it this time so try to bear it cheerfully and dont sadden amys pleasure by reproaches or regrets  ill try said jo winking hard as she knelt down to pick up the basket she had joyfully upset ill take a leaf out of her book and try not only to seem glad but to be so and not grudge her one minute of happiness but it wont be easy for it is a dreadful disappointment and poor jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held with several very bitter tears  jo dear im very selfish but i couldnt spare you and im glad you are not going quite yet whispered beth embracing her basket and all with such a clinging touch and loving face that jo felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears and humbly beg aunt carrol to burden her with this favor and see how gratefully she would bear it  by the time amy came in jo was able to take her part in the family jubilation not quite as heartily as usual perhaps but without repinings at amys good fortune the young lady herself received the news as tidings of great joy went about in a solemn sort of rapture and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening leaving such trifles as clothes money and passports to those less absorbed in visions of art than herself  it isnt a mere pleasure trip to me girls she said impressively as she scraped her best palette it will decide my career for if i have any genius i shall find it out in rome and will do something to prove it  suppose you havent said jo sewing away with red eyes at the new collars which were to be handed over to amy  then i shall come home and teach drawing for my living replied the aspirant for fame with philosophic composure but she made a wry face at the prospect and scratched away at her palette as if bent on vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes  no you wont you hate hard work and youll marry some rich man and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days said jo  your predictions sometimes come to pass but i dont believe that one will im sure i wish it would for if i cant be an artist myself i should like to be able to help those who are said amy smiling as if the part of lady bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor drawing teacher  hum said jo with a sigh if you wish it youll have it for your wishes are always grantedmine never  would you like to go asked amy thoughtfully patting her nose with her knife  rather  well in a year or two ill send for you and well dig in the forum for relics and carry out all the plans weve made so many times  thank you ill remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes if it ever does returned jo accepting the vague but magnificent offer as gratefully as she could  there was not much time for preparation and the house was in a ferment till amy was off jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue ribbon vanished when she retired to her refuge the garret and cried till she couldnt cry any more amy likewise bore up stoutly till the steamer sailed then just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn it suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her and those who loved her best and she clung to laurie the last lingerer saying with a sob  oh take care of them for me and if anything should happen  i will dear i will and if anything happens ill come and comfort you whispered laurie little dreaming that he would be called upon to keep his word  so amy sailed away to find the old world which is always new and beautiful to young eyes while her father and friend watched her from the shore fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall the happyhearted girl who waved her hand to them till they could see nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea     chapter thirtyone our foreign correspondent   london   dearest people here i really sit at a front window of the bath hotel piccadilly its not a fashionable place but uncle stopped here years ago and wont go anywhere else however we dont mean to stay long so its no great matter oh i cant begin to tell you how i enjoy it all i never can so ill only give you bits out of my notebook for ive done nothing but sketch and scribble since i started   i sent a line from halifax when i felt pretty miserable but after that i got on delightfully seldom ill on deck all day with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me everyone was very kind to me especially the officers dont laugh jo gentlemen really are very necessary aboard ship to hold on to or to wait upon one and as they have nothing to do its a mercy to make them useful otherwise they would smoke themselves to death im afraid   aunt and flo were poorly all the way and liked to be let alone so when i had done what i could for them i went and enjoyed myself such walks on deck such sunsets such splendid air and waves it was almost as exciting as riding a fast horse when we went rushing on so grandly i wish beth could have come it would have done her so much good as for jo she would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib or whatever the high thing is called made friends with the engineers and tooted on the captains speaking trumpet shed have been in such a state of rapture   it was all heavenly but i was glad to see the irish coast and found it very lovely so green and sunny with brown cabins here and there ruins on some of the hills and gentlemens countryseats in the valleys with deer feeding in the parks it was early in the morning but i didnt regret getting up to see it for the bay was full of little boats the shore so picturesque and a rosy sky overhead i never shall forget it   at queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us mr lennox and when i said something about the lakes of killarney he sighed and sung with a look at me   oh have you eer heard of kate kearney she lives on the banks of killarney from the glance of her eye shun danger and fly for fatals the glance of kate kearney   wasnt that nonsensical   we only stopped at liverpool a few hours its a dirty noisy place and i was glad to leave it uncle rushed out and bought a pair of dogskin gloves some ugly thick shoes and an umbrella and got shaved à la mutton chop the first thing then he flattered himself that he looked like a true briton but the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes the little bootblack knew that an american stood in them and said with a grin there yer har sir ive given em the latest yankee shine it amused uncle immensely oh i must tell you what that absurd lennox did he got his friend ward who came on with us to order a bouquet for me and the first thing i saw in my room was a lovely one with robert lennoxs compliments on the card wasnt that fun girls i like traveling   i never shall get to london if i dont hurry the trip was like riding through a long picture gallery full of lovely landscapes the farmhouses were my delight with thatched roofs ivy up to the eaves latticed windows and stout women with rosy children at the doors the very cattle looked more tranquil than ours as they stood kneedeep in clover and the hens had a contented cluck as if they never got nervous like yankee biddies such perfect color i never saw the grass so green sky so blue grain so yellow woods so dark i was in a rapture all the way so was flo and we kept bouncing from one side to the other trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the rate of sixty miles an hour aunt was tired and went to sleep but uncle read his guidebook and wouldnt be astonished at anything this is the way we went on amy flying upoh that must be kenilworth that gray place among the trees flo darting to my windowhow sweet we must go there sometime wont we papa uncle calmly admiring his bootsno my dear not unless you want beer thats a brewery   a pausethen flo cried out bless me theres a gallows and a man going up where where shrieks amy staring out at two tall posts with a crossbeam and some dangling chains a colliery remarks uncle with a twinkle of the eye heres a lovely flock of lambs all lying down says amy see papa arent they pretty added flo sentimentally geese young ladies returns uncle in a tone that keeps us quiet till flo settles down to enjoy the flirtations of captain cavendish and i have the scenery all to myself   of course it rained when we got to london and there was nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas we rested unpacked and shopped a little between the showers aunt mary got me some new things for i came off in such a hurry i wasnt half ready a white hat and blue feather a muslin dress to match and the loveliest mantle you ever saw shopping in regent street is perfectly splendid things seem so cheap nice ribbons only sixpence a yard i laid in a stock but shall get my gloves in paris doesnt that sound sort of elegant and rich   flo and i for the fun of it ordered a hansom cab while aunt and uncle were out and went for a drive though we learned afterward that it wasnt the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone it was so droll for when we were shut in by the wooden apron the man drove so fast that flo was frightened and told me to stop him but he was up outside behind somewhere and i couldnt get at him he didnt hear me call nor see me flap my parasol in front and there we were quite helpless rattling away and whirling around corners at a breakneck pace at last in my despair i saw a little door in the roof and on poking it open a red eye appeared and a beery voice said   now then mum   i gave my order as soberly as i could and slamming down the door with an aye aye mum the man made his horse walk as if going to a funeral i poked again and said a little faster then off he went helterskelter as before and we resigned ourselves to our fate   today was fair and we went to hyde park close by for we are more aristocratic than we look the duke of devonshire lives near i often see his footmen lounging at the back gate and the duke of wellingtons house is not far off such sights as i saw my dear it was as good as punch for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and yellow coaches with gorgeous jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats up behind and powdered coachmen in front smart maids with the rosiest children i ever saw handsome girls looking half asleep dandies in queer english hats and lavender kids lounging about and tall soldiers in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side looking so funny i longed to sketch them   rotten row means route de roi or the kings way but now its more like a riding school than anything else the horses are splendid and the men especially the grooms ride well but the women are stiff and bounce which isnt according to our rules i longed to show them a tearing american gallop for they trotted solemnly up and down in their scant habits and high hats looking like the women in a toy noahs ark everyone ridesold men stout ladies little childrenand the young folks do a deal of flirting here i saw a pair exchange rose buds for its the thing to wear one in the buttonhole and i thought it rather a nice little idea   in the pm to westminster abbey but dont expect me to describe it thats impossible so ill only say it was sublime this evening we are going to see fechter which will be an appropriate end to the happiest day of my life   its very late but i cant let my letter go in the morning without telling you what happened last evening who do you think came in as we were at tea lauries english friends fred and frank vaughn i was so surprised for i shouldnt have known them but for the cards both are tall fellows with whiskers fred handsome in the english style and frank much better for he only limps slightly and uses no crutches they had heard from laurie where we were to be and came to ask us to their house but uncle wont go so we shall return the call and see them as we can they went to the theater with us and we did have such a good time for frank devoted himself to flo and fred and i talked over past present and future fun as if we had known each other all our days tell beth frank asked for her and was sorry to hear of her ill health fred laughed when i spoke of jo and sent his respectful compliments to the big hat neither of them had forgotten camp laurence or the fun we had there what ages ago it seems doesnt it   aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time so i must stop i really feel like a dissipated london fine lady writing here so late with my room full of pretty things and my head a jumble of parks theaters new gowns and gallant creatures who say ah and twirl their blond mustaches with the true english lordliness i long to see you all and in spite of my nonsense am as ever your loving   amy   paris   dear girls   in my last i told you about our london visit how kind the vaughns were and what pleasant parties they made for us i enjoyed the trips to hampton court and the kensington museum more than anything else for at hampton i saw raphaels cartoons and at the museum rooms full of pictures by turner lawrence reynolds hogarth and the other great creatures the day in richmond park was charming for we had a regular english picnic and i had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than i could copy also heard a nightingale and saw larks go up we did london to our hearts content thanks to fred and frank and were sorry to go away for though english people are slow to take you in when they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in hospitality i think the vaughns hope to meet us in rome next winter and i shall be dreadfully disappointed if they dont for grace and i are great friends and the boys very nice fellows especially fred   well we were hardly settled here when he turned up again saying he had come for a holiday and was going to switzerland aunt looked sober at first but he was so cool about it she couldnt say a word and now we get on nicely and are very glad he came for he speaks french like a native and i dont know what we should do without him uncle doesnt know ten words and insists on talking english very loud as if it would make people understand him aunts pronunciation is oldfashioned and flo and i though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good deal find we dont and are very grateful to have fred do the parley vooing as uncle calls it   such delightful times as we are having sightseeing from morning till night stopping for nice lunches in the gay cafes and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures rainy days i spend in the louvre revelling in pictures jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of the finest because she has no soul for art but i have and im cultivating eye and taste as fast as i can she would like the relics of great people better for ive seen her napoleons cocked hat and gray coat his babys cradle and his old toothbrush also marie antoinettes little shoe the ring of saint denis charlemagnes sword and many other interesting things ill talk for hours about them when i come but havent time to write   the palais royale is a heavenly place so full of bijouterie and lovely things that im nearly distracted because i cant buy them fred wanted to get me some but of course i didnt allow it then the bois and champs elysees are tres magnifique ive seen the imperial family several times the emperor an ugly hardlooking man the empress pale and pretty but dressed in bad taste i thoughtpurple dress green hat and yellow gloves little nap is a handsome boy who sits chatting to his tutor and kisses his hand to the people as he passes in his fourhorse barouche with postilions in red satin jackets and a mounted guard before and behind   we often walk in the tuileries gardens for they are lovely though the antique luxembourg gardens suit me better pere la chaise is very curious for many of the tombs are like small rooms and looking in one sees a table with images or pictures of the dead and chairs for the mourners to sit in when they come to lament that is so frenchy   our rooms are on the rue de rivoli and sitting on the balcony we look up and down the long brilliant street it is so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there when too tired with our days work to go out fred is very entertaining and is altogether the most agreeable young man i ever knewexcept laurie whose manners are more charming i wish fred was dark for i dont fancy light men however the vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent family so i wont find fault with their yellow hair as my own is yellower   next week we are off to germany and switzerland and as we shall travel fast i shall only be able to give you hasty letters i keep my diary and try to remember correctly and describe clearly all that i see and admire as father advised it is good practice for me and with my sketchbook will give you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles   adieu i embrace you tenderly votre amie   heidelberg   my dear mamma   having a quiet hour before we leave for berne ill try to tell you what has happened for some of it is very important as you will see   the sail up the rhine was perfect and i just sat and enjoyed it with all my might get fathers old guidebooks and read about it i havent words beautiful enough to describe it at coblentz we had a lovely time for some students from bonn with whom fred got acquainted on the boat gave us a serenade it was a moonlight night and about one oclock flo and i were waked by the most delicious music under our windows we flew up and hid behind the curtains but sly peeps showed us fred and the students singing away down below it was the most romantic thing i ever sawthe river the bridge of boats the great fortress opposite moonlight everywhere and music fit to melt a heart of stone   when they were done we threw down some flowers and saw them scramble for them kiss their hands to the invisible ladies and go laughing away to smoke and drink beer i suppose next morning fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket and looked very sentimental i laughed at him and said i didnt throw it but flo which seemed to disgust him for he tossed it out of the window and turned sensible again im afraid im going to have trouble with that boy it begins to look like it   the baths at nassau were very gay so was badenbaden where fred lost some money and i scolded him he needs someone to look after him when frank is not with him kate said once she hoped hed marry soon and i quite agree with her that it would be well for him frankfurt was delightful i saw goethes house schillers statue and danneckers famous ariadne it was very lovely but i should have enjoyed it more if i had known the story better i didnt like to ask as everyone knew it or pretended they did i wish jo would tell me all about it i ought to have read more for i find i dont know anything and it mortifies me   now comes the serious part for it happened here and fred has just gone he has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him i never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the serenade night since then ive begun to feel that the moonlight walks balcony talks and daily adventures were something more to him than fun i havent flirted mother truly but remembered what you said to me and have done my very best i cant help it if people like me i dont try to make them and it worries me if i dont care for them though jo says i havent got any heart now i know mother will shake her head and the girls say oh the mercenary little wretch but ive made up my mind and if fred asks me i shall accept him though im not madly in love i like him and we get on comfortably together he is handsome young clever enough and very richever so much richer than the laurences i dont think his family would object and i should be very happy for they are all kind wellbred generous people and they like me fred as the eldest twin will have the estate i suppose and such a splendid one it is a city house in a fashionable street not so showy as our big houses but twice as comfortable and full of solid luxury such as english people believe in i like it for its genuine ive seen the plate the family jewels the old servants and pictures of the country place with its park great house lovely grounds and fine horses oh it would be all i should ask and id rather have it than any title such as girls snap up so readily and find nothing behind i may be mercenary but i hate poverty and dont mean to bear it a minute longer than i can help one of us must marry well meg didnt jo wont beth cant yet so i shall and make everything okay all round i wouldnt marry a man i hated or despised you may be sure of that and though fred is not my model hero he does very well and in time i should get fond enough of him if he was very fond of me and let me do just as i liked so ive been turning the matter over in my mind the last week for it was impossible to help seeing that fred liked me he said nothing but little things showed it he never goes with flo always gets on my side of the carriage table or promenade looks sentimental when we are alone and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak to me yesterday at dinner when an austrian officer stared at us and then said something to his friend a rakishlooking baron about ein wonderschones blondchen fred looked as fierce as a lion and cut his meat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate he isnt one of the cool stiff englishmen but is rather peppery for he has scotch blood in him as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes   well last evening we went up to the castle about sunset at least all of us but fred who was to meet us there after going to the post restante for letters we had a charming time poking about the ruins the vaults where the monster tun is and the beautiful gardens made by the elector long ago for his english wife i liked the great terrace best for the view was divine so while the rest went to see the rooms inside i sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lions head on the wall with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it i felt as if id got into a romance sitting there watching the neckar rolling through the valley listening to the music of the austrian band below and waiting for my lover like a real storybook girl i had a feeling that something was going to happen and i was ready for it i didnt feel blushy or quakey but quite cool and only a little excited   byandby i heard freds voice and then he came hurrying through the great arch to find me he looked so troubled that i forgot all about myself and asked what the matter was he said hed just got a letter begging him to come home for frank was very ill so he was going at once on the night train and only had time to say goodby i was very sorry for him and disappointed for myself but only for a minute because he said as he shook hands and said it in a way that i could not mistake i shall soon come back you wont forget me amy   i didnt promise but i looked at him and he seemed satisfied and there was no time for anything but messages and goodbyes for he was off in an hour and we all miss him very much i know he wanted to speak but i think from something he once hinted that he had promised his father not to do anything of the sort yet a while for he is a rash boy and the old gentleman dreads a foreign daughterinlaw we shall soon meet in rome and then if i dont change my mind ill say yes thank you when he says will you please   of course this is all very private but i wished you to know what was going on dont be anxious about me remember i am your prudent amy and be sure i will do nothing rashly send me as much advice as you like ill use it if i can i wish i could see you for a good talk marmee love and trust me   ever your amy     chapter thirtytwo tender troubles   jo im anxious about beth  why mother she has seemed unusually well since the babies came  its not her health that troubles me now its her spirits im sure there is something on her mind and i want you to discover what it is  what makes you think so mother  she sits alone a good deal and doesnt talk to her father as much as she used i found her crying over the babies the other day when she sings the songs are always sad ones and now and then i see a look in her face that i dont understand this isnt like beth and it worries me  have you asked her about it  i have tried once or twice but she either evaded my questions or looked so distressed that i stopped i never force my childrens confidence and i seldom have to wait for long  mrs march glanced at jo as she spoke but the face opposite seemed quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but beths and after sewing thoughtfully for a minute jo said i think she is growing up and so begins to dream dreams and have hopes and fears and fidgets without knowing why or being able to explain them why mother beths eighteen but we dont realize it and treat her like a child forgetting shes a woman  so she is dear heart how fast you do grow up returned her mother with a sigh and a smile  cant be helped marmee so you must resign yourself to all sorts of worries and let your birds hop out of the nest one by one i promise never to hop very far if that is any comfort to you  its a great comfort jo i always feel strong when you are at home now meg is gone beth is too feeble and amy too young to depend upon but when the tug comes you are always ready  why you know i dont mind hard jobs much and there must always be one scrub in a family amy is splendid in fine works and im not but i feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up or half the family fall sick at once amy is distinguishing herself abroad but if anything is amiss at home im your man  i leave beth to your hands then for she will open her tender little heart to her jo sooner than to anyone else be very kind and dont let her think anyone watches or talks about her if she only would get quite strong and cheerful again i shouldnt have a wish in the world  happy woman ive got heaps  my dear what are they  ill settle bethys troubles and then ill tell you mine they are not very wearing so theyll keep and jo stitched away with a wise nod which set her mothers heart at rest about her for the present at least  while apparently absorbed in her own affairs jo watched beth and after many conflicting conjectures finally settled upon one which seemed to explain the change in her a slight incident gave jo the clue to the mystery she thought and lively fancy loving heart did the rest she was affecting to write busily one saturday afternoon when she and beth were alone together yet as she scribbled she kept her eye on her sister who seemed unusually quiet sitting at the window beths work often dropped into her lap and she leaned her head upon her hand in a dejected attitude while her eyes rested on the dull autumnal landscape suddenly some one passed below whistling like an operatic blackbird and a voice called out all serene coming in tonight  beth started leaned forward smiled and nodded watched the passerby till his quick tramp died away then said softly as if to herself how strong and well and happy that dear boy looks  hum said jo still intent upon her sisters face for the bright color faded as quickly as it came the smile vanished and presently a tear lay shining on the window ledge beth whisked it off and in her halfaverted face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill fearing to betray herself she slipped away murmuring something about needing more paper  mercy on me beth loves laurie she said sitting down in her own room pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had just made i never dreamed of such a thing what will mother say i wonder if her there jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden thought if he shouldnt love back again how dreadful it would be he must ill make him and she shook her head threateningly at the picture of the mischievouslooking boy laughing at her from the wall oh dear we are growing up with a vengeance heres meg married and a mamma amy flourishing away at paris and beth in love im the only one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief jo thought intently for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture then she smoothed out her wrinkled forehead and said with a decided nod at the face opposite no thank you sir youre very charming but youve no more stability than a weathercock so you neednt write touching notes and smile in that insinuating way for it wont do a bit of good and i wont have it  then she sighed and fell into a reverie from which she did not wake till the early twilight sent her down to take new observations which only confirmed her suspicion though laurie flirted with amy and joked with jo his manner to beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle but so was everybodys therefore no one thought of imagining that he cared more for her than for the others indeed a general impression had prevailed in the family of late that our boy was getting fonder than ever of jo who however wouldnt hear a word upon the subject and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it if they had known the various tender passages which had been nipped in the bud they would have had the immense satisfaction of saying i told you so but jo hated philandering and wouldnt allow it always having a joke or a smile ready at the least sign of impending danger  when laurie first went to college he fell in love about once a month but these small flames were as brief as ardent did no damage and much amused jo who took great interest in the alternations of hope despair and resignation which were confided to her in their weekly conferences but there came a time when laurie ceased to worship at many shrines hinted darkly at one allabsorbing passion and indulged occasionally in byronic fits of gloom then he avoided the tender subject altogether wrote philosophical notes to jo turned studious and gave out that he was going to dig intending to graduate in a blaze of glory this suited the young lady better than twilight confidences tender pressures of the hand and eloquent glances of the eye for with jo brain developed earlier than heart and she preferred imaginary heroes to real ones because when tired of them the former could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for and the latter were less manageable  things were in this state when the grand discovery was made and jo watched laurie that night as she had never done before if she had not got the new idea into her head she would have seen nothing unusual in the fact that beth was very quiet and laurie very kind to her but having given the rein to her lively fancy it galloped away with her at a great pace and common sense being rather weakened by a long course of romance writing did not come to the rescue as usual beth lay on the sofa and laurie sat in a low chair close by amusing her with all sorts of gossip for she depended on her weekly spin and he never disappointed her but that evening jo fancied that beths eyes rested on the lively dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure and that she listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting cricket match though the phrases caught off a tice stumped off his ground and the leg hit for three were as intelligible to her as sanskrit she also fancied having set her heart upon seeing it that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in lauries manner that he dropped his voice now and then laughed less than usual was a little absentminded and settled the afghan over beths feet with an assiduity that was really almost tender  who knows stranger things have happened thought jo as she fussed about the room she will make quite an angel of him and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear if they only love each other i dont see how he can help it and i do believe he would if the rest of us were out of the way  as everyone was out of the way but herself jo began to feel that she ought to dispose of herself with all speed but where should she go and burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion she sat down to settle that point  now the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofalong broad wellcushioned and low a trifle shabby as well it might be for the girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies fished over the back rode on the arms and had menageries under it as children and rested tired heads dreamed dreams and listened to tender talk on it as young women they all loved it for it was a family refuge and one corner had always been jos favorite lounging place among the many pillows that adorned the venerable couch was one hard round covered with prickly horsehair and furnished with a knobby button at each end this repulsive pillow was her especial property being used as a weapon of defense a barricade or a stern preventive of too much slumber  laurie knew this pillow well and had cause to regard it with deep aversion having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days when romping was allowed and now frequently debarred by it from the seat he most coveted next to jo in the sofa corner if the sausage as they called it stood on end it was a sign that he might approach and repose but if it lay flat across the sofa woe to man woman or child who dared disturb it that evening jo forgot to barricade her corner and had not been in her seat five minutes before a massive form appeared beside her and with both arms spread over the sofa back both long legs stretched out before him laurie exclaimed with a sigh of satisfaction  now this is filling at the price  no slang snapped jo slamming down the pillow but it was too late there was no room for it and coasting onto the floor it disappeared in a most mysterious manner  come jo dont be thorny after studying himself to a skeleton all the week a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it  beth will pet you im busy  no shes not to be bothered with me but you like that sort of thing unless youve suddenly lost your taste for it have you do you hate your boy and want to fire pillows at him  anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard but jo quenched her boy by turning on him with a stern query how many bouquets have you sent miss randal this week  not one upon my word shes engaged now then  im glad of it thats one of your foolish extravagances sending flowers and things to girls for whom you dont care two pins continued jo reprovingly  sensible girls for whom i do care whole papers of pins wont let me send them flowers and things so what can i do my feelings need a vent  mother doesnt approve of flirting even in fun and you do flirt desperately teddy  id give anything if i could answer so do you as i cant ill merely say that i dont see any harm in that pleasant little game if all parties understand that its only play  well it does look pleasant but i cant learn how its done ive tried because one feels awkward in company not to do as everybody else is doing but i dont seem to get on said jo forgetting to play mentor  take lessons of amy she has a regular talent for it  yes she does it very prettily and never seems to go too far i suppose its natural to some people to please without trying and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place  im glad you cant flirt its really refreshing to see a sensible straightforward girl who can be jolly and kind without making a fool of herself between ourselves jo some of the girls i know really do go on at such a rate im ashamed of them they dont mean any harm im sure but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward theyd mend their ways i fancy  they do the same and as their tongues are the sharpest you fellows get the worst of it for you are as silly as they every bit if you behaved properly they would but knowing you like their nonsense they keep it up and then you blame them  much you know about it maam said laurie in a superior tone we dont like romps and flirts though we may act as if we did sometimes the pretty modest girls are never talked about except respectfully among gentleman bless your innocent soul if you could be in my place for a month youd see things that would astonish you a trifle upon my word when i see one of those harumscarum girls i always want to say with our friend cock robin  out upon you fie upon you boldfaced jig   it was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between lauries chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind and his very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society showed him many samples jo knew that young laurence was regarded as a most eligible parti by worldly mamas was much smiled upon by their daughters and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb of him so she watched him rather jealously fearing he would be spoiled and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in modest girls returning suddenly to her admonitory tone she said dropping her voice if you must have a vent teddy go and devote yourself to one of the pretty modest girls whom you do respect and not waste your time with the silly ones  you really advise it and laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face  yes i do but youd better wait till you are through college on the whole and be fitting yourself for the place meantime youre not half good enough forwell whoever the modest girl may be and jo looked a little queer likewise for a name had almost escaped her  that im not acquiesced laurie with an expression of humility quite new to him as he dropped his eyes and absently wound jos apron tassel round his finger  mercy on us this will never do thought jo adding aloud go and sing to me im dying for some music and always like yours  id rather stay here thank you  well you cant there isnt room go and make yourself useful since you are too big to be ornamental i thought you hated to be tied to a womans apron string retorted jo quoting certain rebellious words of his own  ah that depends on who wears the apron and laurie gave an audacious tweak at the tassel  are you going demanded jo diving for the pillow  he fled at once and the minute it was well up with the bonnets of bonnie dundee she slipped away to return no more till the young gentleman departed in high dudgeon  jo lay long awake that night and was just dropping off when the sound of a stifled sob made her fly to beths bedside with the anxious inquiry what is it dear  i thought you were asleep sobbed beth  is it the old pain my precious  no its a new one but i can bear it and beth tried to check her tears  tell me all about it and let me cure it as i often did the other  you cant there is no cure there beths voice gave way and clinging to her sister she cried so despairingly that jo was frightened  where is it shall i call mother  no no dont call her dont tell her i shall be better soon lie down here and poor my head ill be quiet and go to sleep indeed i will  jo obeyed but as her hand went softly to and fro across beths hot forehead and wet eyelids her heart was very full and she longed to speak but young as she was jo had learned that hearts like flowers cannot be rudely handled but must open naturally so though she believed she knew the cause of beths new pain she only said in her tenderest tone does anything trouble you deary  yes jo after a long pause  wouldnt it comfort you to tell me what it is  not now not yet  then i wont ask but remember bethy that mother and jo are always glad to hear and help you if they can  i know it ill tell you byandby  is the pain better now  oh yes much better you are so comfortable jo  go to sleep dear ill stay with you  so cheek to cheek they fell asleep and on the morrow beth seemed quite herself again for at eighteen neither heads nor hearts ache long and a loving word can medicine most ills  but jo had made up her mind and after pondering over a project for some days she confided it to her mother  you asked me the other day what my wishes were ill tell you one of them marmee she began as they sat along together i want to go away somewhere this winter for a change  why jo and her mother looked up quickly as if the words suggested a double meaning  with her eyes on her work jo answered soberly i want something new i feel restless and anxious to be seeing doing and learning more than i am i brood too much over my own small affairs and need stirring up so as i can be spared this winter id like to hop a little way and try my wings  where will you hop  to new york i had a bright idea yesterday and this is it you know mrs kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her children and sew its rather hard to find just the thing but i think i should suit if i tried  my dear go out to service in that great boarding house and mrs march looked surprised but not displeased  its not exactly going out to service for mrs kirke is your friendthe kindest soul that ever livedand would make things pleasant for me i know her family is separate from the rest and no one knows me there dont care if they do its honest work and im not ashamed of it  nor i but your writing  all the better for the change i shall see and hear new things get new ideas and even if i havent much time there i shall bring home quantities of material for my rubbish  i have no doubt of it but are these your only reasons for this sudden fancy  no mother  may i know the others  jo looked up and jo looked down then said slowly with sudden color in her cheeks it may be vain and wrong to say it butim afraidlaurie is getting too fond of me  then you dont care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care for you and mrs march looked anxious as she put the question  mercy no i love the dear boy as i always have and am immensely proud of him but as for anything more its out of the question  im glad of that jo  why please  because dear i dont think you suited to one another as friends you are very happy and your frequent quarrels soon blow over but i fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life you are too much alike and too fond of freedom not to mention hot tempers and strong wills to get on happily together in a relation which needs infinite patience and forbearance as well as love  thats just the feeling i had though i couldnt express it im glad you think he is only beginning to care for me it would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy for i couldnt fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude could i  you are sure of his feeling for you  the color deepened in jos cheeks as she answered with the look of mingled pleasure pride and pain which young girls wear when speaking of first lovers im afraid it is so mother he hasnt said anything but he looks a great deal i think i had better go away before it comes to anything  i agree with you and if it can be managed you shall go  jo looked relieved and after a pause said smiling how mrs moffat would wonder at your want of management if she knew and how she will rejoice that annie may still hope  ah jo mothers may differ in their management but the hope is the same in allthe desire to see their children happy meg is so and i am content with her success you i leave to enjoy your liberty till you tire of it for only then will you find that there is something sweeter amy is my chief care now but her good sense will help her for beth i indulge no hopes except that she may be well by the way she seems brighter this last day or two have you spoken to her  yes she owned she had a trouble and promised to tell me byandby i said no more for i think i know it and jo told her little story  mrs march shook her head and did not take so romantic a view of the case but looked grave and repeated her opinion that for lauries sake jo should go away for a time  let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled then ill run away before he can collect his wits and be tragic beth must think im going to please myself as i am for i cant talk about laurie to her but she can pet and comfort him after im gone and so cure him of this romantic notion hes been through so many little trials of the sort hes used to it and will soon get over his lovelornity  jo spoke hopefully but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear that this little trial would be harder than the others and that laurie would not get over his lovelornity as easily as heretofore  the plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon for mrs kirke gladly accepted jo and promised to make a pleasant home for her the teaching would render her independent and such leisure as she got might be made profitable by writing while the new scenes and society would be both useful and agreeable jo liked the prospect and was eager to be gone for the home nest was growing too narrow for her restless nature and adventurous spirit when all was settled with fear and trembling she told laurie but to her surprise he took it very quietly he had been graver than usual of late but very pleasant and when jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf he answered soberly so i am and i mean this one shall stay turned  jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on just then and made her preparations with a lightened heart for beth seemed more cheerful and hoped she was doing the best for all  one thing i leave in your especial care she said the night before she left  you mean your papers asked beth  no my boy be very good to him wont you  of course i will but i cant fill your place and hell miss you sadly  it wont hurt him so remember i leave him in your charge to plague pet and keep in order  ill do my best for your sake promised beth wondering why jo looked at her so queerly  when laurie said goodby he whispered significantly it wont do a bit of good jo my eye is on you so mind what you do or ill come and bring you home     chapter thirtythree jos journal   new york november   dear marmee and beth   im going to write you a regular volume for ive got heaps to tell though im not a fine young lady traveling on the continent when i lost sight of fathers dear old face i felt a trifle blue and might have shed a briny drop or two if an irish lady with four small children all crying more or less hadnt diverted my mind for i amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their mouths to roar   soon the sun came out and taking it as a good omen i cleared up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart   mrs kirke welcomed me so kindly i felt at home at once even in that big house full of strangers she gave me a funny little sky parlorall she had but there is a stove in it and a nice table in a sunny window so i can sit here and write whenever i like a fine view and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs and i took a fancy to my den on the spot the nursery where i am to teach and sew is a pleasant room next mrs kirkes private parlor and the two little girls are pretty children rather spoiled i fancy but they took to me after telling them the seven bad pigs and ive no doubt i shall make a model governess   i am to have my meals with the children if i prefer it to the great table and for the present i do for i am bashful though no one will believe it   now my dear make yourself at home said mrs k in her motherly way im on the drive from morning to night as you may suppose with such a family but a great anxiety will be off my mind if i know the children are safe with you my rooms are always open to you and your own shall be as comfortable as i can make it there are some pleasant people in the house if you feel sociable and your evenings are always free come to me if anything goes wrong and be as happy as you can theres the tea bell i must run and change my cap and off she bustled leaving me to settle myself in my new nest   as i went downstairs soon after i saw something i liked the flights are very long in this tall house and as i stood waiting at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber up i saw a gentleman come along behind her take the heavy hod of coal out of her hand carry it all the way up put it down at a door near by and walk away saying with a kind nod and a foreign accent it goes better so the little back is too young to haf such heaviness   wasnt it good of him i like such things for as father says trifles show character when i mentioned it to mrs k that evening she laughed and said that must have been professor bhaer hes always doing things of that sort   mrs k told me he was from berlin very learned and good but poor as a church mouse and gives lessons to support himself and two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here according to the wishes of his sister who married an american not a very romantic story but it interested me and i was glad to hear that mrs k lends him her parlor for some of his scholars there is a glass door between it and the nursery and i mean to peep at him and then ill tell you how he looks hes almost forty so its no harm marmee   after tea and a gotobed romp with the little girls i attacked the big workbasket and had a quiet evening chatting with my new friend i shall keep a journalletter and send it once a week so goodnight and more tomorrow   tuesday eve   had a lively time in my seminary this morning for the children acted like sancho and at one time i really thought i should shake them all round some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics and i kept it up till they were glad to sit down and keep still after luncheon the girl took them out for a walk and i went to my needlework like little mabel with a willing mind i was thanking my stars that id learned to make nice buttonholes when the parlor door opened and shut and someone began to hum kennst du das land like a big bumblebee it was dreadfully improper i know but i couldnt resist the temptation and lifting one end of the curtain before the glass door i peeped in professor bhaer was there and while he arranged his books i took a good look at him a regular germanrather stout with brown hair tumbled all over his head a bushy beard good nose the kindest eyes i ever saw and a splendid big voice that does ones ears good after our sharp or slipshod american gabble his clothes were rusty his hands were large and he hadnt a really handsome feature in his face except his beautiful teeth yet i liked him for he had a fine head his linen was very nice and he looked like a gentleman though two buttons were off his coat and there was a patch on one shoe he looked sober in spite of his humming till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth bulbs toward the sun and stroke the cat who received him like an old friend then he smiled and when a tap came at the door called out in a loud brisk tone herein   i was just going to run when i caught sight of a morsel of a child carrying a big book and stopped to see what was going on   me wants me bhaer said the mite slamming down her book and running to meet him   thou shalt haf thy bhaer come then and take a goot hug from him my tina said the professor catching her up with a laugh and holding her so high over his head that she had to stoop her little face to kiss him   now me mus tuddy my lessin went on the funny little thing so he put her up at the table opened the great dictionary she had brought and gave her a paper and pencil and she scribbled away turning a leaf now and then and passing her little fat finger down the page as if finding a word so soberly that i nearly betrayed myself by a laugh while mr bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look that made me think she must be his own though she looked more french than german   another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my work and there i virtuously remained through all the noise and gabbling that went on next door one of the girls kept laughing affectedly and saying now professor in a coquettish tone and the other pronounced her german with an accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober   both seemed to try his patience sorely for more than once i heard him say emphatically no no it is not so you haf not attend to what i say and once there was a loud rap as if he struck the table with his book followed by the despairing exclamation prut it all goes bad this day   poor man i pitied him and when the girls were gone took just one more peep to see if he survived it he seemed to have thrown himself back in his chair tired out and sat there with his eyes shut till the clock struck two when he jumped up put his books in his pocket as if ready for another lesson and taking little tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his arms he carried her quietly away i fancy he has a hard life of it mrs kirke asked me if i wouldnt go down to the five oclock dinner and feeling a little bit homesick i thought i would just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me so i made myself respectable and tried to slip in behind mrs kirke but as she is short and im tall my efforts at concealment were rather a failure she gave me a seat by her and after my face cooled off i plucked up courage and looked about me the long table was full and every one intent on getting their dinner the gentlemen especially who seemed to be eating on time for they bolted in every sense of the word vanishing as soon as they were done there was the usual assortment of young men absorbed in themselves young couples absorbed in each other married ladies in their babies and old gentlemen in politics i dont think i shall care to have much to do with any of them except one sweetfaced maiden lady who looks as if she had something in her   cast away at the very bottom of the table was the professor shouting answers to the questions of a very inquisitive deaf old gentleman on one side and talking philosophy with a frenchman on the other if amy had been here shed have turned her back on him forever because sad to relate he had a great appetite and shoveled in his dinner in a manner which would have horrified her ladyship i didnt mind for i like to see folks eat with a relish as hannah says and the poor man must have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day   as i went upstairs after dinner two of the young men were settling their hats before the hall mirror and i heard one say low to the other whos the new party   governess or something of that sort   what the deuce is she at our table for   friend of the old ladys   handsome head but no style   not a bit of it give us a light and come on   i felt angry at first and then i didnt care for a governess is as good as a clerk and ive got sense if i havent style which is more than some people have judging from the remarks of the elegant beings who clattered away smoking like bad chimneys i hate ordinary people   thursday   yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching sewing and writing in my little room which is very cozy with a light and fire i picked up a few bits of news and was introduced to the professor it seems that tina is the child of the frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the laundry here the little thing has lost her heart to mr bhaer and follows him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home which delights him as he is very fond of children though a bacheldore kitty and minnie kirke likewise regard him with affection and tell all sorts of stories about the plays he invents the presents he brings and the splendid tales he tells the younger men quiz him it seems call him old fritz lager beer ursa major and make all manner of jokes on his name but he enjoys it like a boy mrs kirke says and takes it so goodnaturedly that they all like him in spite of his foreign ways   the maiden lady is a miss norton rich cultivated and kind she spoke to me at dinner today for i went to table again its such fun to watch people and asked me to come and see her at her room she has fine books and pictures knows interesting persons and seems friendly so i shall make myself agreeable for i do want to get into good society only it isnt the same sort that amy likes   i was in our parlor last evening when mr bhaer came in with some newspapers for mrs kirke she wasnt there but minnie who is a little old woman introduced me very prettily this is mammas friend miss march   yes and shes jolly and we like her lots added kitty who is an enfant terrible   we both bowed and then we laughed for the prim introduction and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast   ah yes i hear these naughty ones go to vex you mees marsch if so again call at me and i come he said with a threatening frown that delighted the little wretches   i promised i would and he departed but it seems as if i was doomed to see a good deal of him for today as i passed his door on my way out by accident i knocked against it with my umbrella it flew open and there he stood in his dressing gown with a big blue sock on one hand and a darning needle in the other he didnt seem at all ashamed of it for when i explained and hurried on he waved his hand sock and all saying in his loud cheerful way   you haf a fine day to make your walk bon voyage mademoiselle   i laughed all the way downstairs but it was a little pathetic also to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes the german gentlemen embroider i know but darning hose is another thing and not so pretty   saturday   nothing has happened to write about except a call on miss norton who has a room full of pretty things and who was very charming for she showed me all her treasures and asked me if i would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts as her escort if i enjoyed them she put it as a favor but im sure mrs kirke has told her about us and she does it out of kindness to me im as proud as lucifer but such favors from such people dont burden me and i accepted gratefully   when i got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the parlor that i looked in and there was mr bhaer down on his hands and knees with tina on his back kitty leading him with a jump rope and minnie feeding two small boys with seedcakes as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs   we are playing nargerie explained kitty   dis is mine effalunt added tina holding on by the professors hair   mamma always allows us to do what we like saturday afternoon when franz and emil come doesnt she mr bhaer said minnie   the effalunt sat up looking as much in earnest as any of them and said soberly to me i gif you my wort it is so if we make too large a noise you shall say hush to us and we go more softly   i promised to do so but left the door open and enjoyed the fun as much as they did for a more glorious frolic i never witnessed they played tag and soldiers danced and sang and when it began to grow dark they all piled onto the sofa about the professor while he told charming fairy stories of the storks on the chimney tops and the little koblods who ride the snowflakes as they fall i wish americans were as simple and natural as germans dont you   im so fond of writing i should go spinning on forever if motives of economy didnt stop me for though ive used thin paper and written fine i tremble to think of the stamps this long letter will need pray forward amys as soon as you can spare them my small news will sound very flat after her splendors but you will like them i know is teddy studying so hard that he cant find time to write to his friends take good care of him for me beth and tell me all about the babies and give heaps of love to everyone from your faithful jo   ps on reading over my letter it strikes me as rather bhaery but i am always interested in odd people and i really had nothing else to write about bless you   december   my precious betsey   as this is to be a scribblescrabble letter i direct it to you for it may amuse you and give you some idea of my goings on for though quiet they are rather amusing for which oh be joyful after what amy would call herculaneum efforts in the way of mental and moral agriculture my young ideas begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend as i could wish they are not so interesting to me as tina and the boys but i do my duty by them and they are fond of me franz and emil are jolly little lads quite after my own heart for the mixture of german and american spirit in them produces a constant state of effervescence saturday afternoons are riotous times whether spent in the house or out for on pleasant days they all go to walk like a seminary with the professor and myself to keep order and then such fun   we are very good friends now and ive begun to take lessons i really couldnt help it and it all came about in such a droll way that i must tell you to begin at the beginning mrs kirke called to me one day as i passed mr bhaers room where she was rummaging   did you ever see such a den my dear just come and help me put these books to rights for ive turned everything upside down trying to discover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs i gave him not long ago   i went in and while we worked i looked about me for it was a den to be sure books and papers everywhere a broken meerschaum and an old flute over the mantlepiece as if done with a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one window seat and a box of white mice adorned the other halffinished boats and bits of string lay among the manuscripts dirty little boots stood drying before the fire and traces of the dearly beloved boys for whom he makes a slave of himself were to be seen all over the room after a grand rummage three of the missing articles were found one over the bird cage one covered with ink and a third burned brown having been used as a holder   such a man laughed goodnatured mrs k as she put the relics in the rag bag i suppose the others are torn up to rig ships bandage cut fingers or make kite tails its dreadful but i cant scold him hes so absentminded and goodnatured he lets those boys ride over him roughshod i agreed to do his washing and mending but he forgets to give out his things and i forget to look them over so he comes to a sad pass sometimes   let me mend them said i i dont mind it and he neednt know id like to hes so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending books   so i have got his things in order and knit heels into two pairs of the socks for they were boggled out of shape with his queer darns nothing was said and i hoped he wouldnt find it out but one day last week he caught me at it hearing the lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much that i took a fancy to learn for tina runs in and out leaving the door open and i can hear i had been sitting near this door finishing off the last sock and trying to understand what he said to a new scholar who is as stupid as i am the girl had gone and i thought he had also it was so still and i was busily gabbling over a verb and rocking to and fro in a most absurd way when a little crow made me look up and there was mr bhaer looking and laughing quietly while he made signs to tina not to betray him   so he said as i stopped and stared like a goose you peep at me i peep at you and this is not bad but see i am not pleasanting when i say haf you a wish for german   yes but you are too busy i am too stupid to learn i blundered out as red as a peony   prut we will make the time and we fail not to find the sense at efening i shall gif a little lesson with much gladness for look you mees marsch i haf this debt to pay and he pointed to my work yes they say to one another these so kind ladies he is a stupid old fellow he will see not what we do he will never observe that his sock heels go not in holes any more he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall and believe that strings make theirselves ah but i haf an eye and i see much i haf a heart and i feel thanks for this come a little lesson then and now orno more good fairy works for me and mine   of course i couldnt say anything after that and as it really is a splendid opportunity i made the bargain and we began i took four lessons and then i stuck fast in a grammatical bog the professor was very patient with me but it must have been torment to him and now and then hed look at me with such an expression of mild despair that it was a tossup with me whether to laugh or cry i tried both ways and when it came to a sniff or utter mortification and woe he just threw the grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room i felt myself disgraced and deserted forever but didnt blame him a particle and was scrambling my papers together meaning to rush upstairs and shake myself hard when in he came as brisk and beaming as if id covered myself in glory   now we shall try a new way you and i will read these pleasant little marchen together and dig no more in that dry book that goes in the corner for making us trouble   he spoke so kindly and opened hans andersons fairy tales so invitingly before me that i was more ashamed than ever and went at my lesson in a neckornothing style that seemed to amuse him immensely i forgot my bashfulness and pegged away no other word will express it with all my might tumbling over long words pronouncing according to inspiration of the minute and doing my very best when i finished reading my first page and stopped for breath he clapped his hands and cried out in his hearty way das ist gut now we go well my turn i do him in german gif me your ear and away he went rumbling out the words with his strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well as hear fortunately the story was the constant tin soldier which is droll you know so i could laugh and i did though i didnt understand half he read for i couldnt help it he was so earnest i so excited and the whole thing so comical   after that we got on better and now i read my lessons pretty well for this way of studying suits me and i can see that the grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly i like it very much and he doesnt seem tired of it yet which is very good of him isnt it i mean to give him something on christmas for i dare not offer money tell me something nice marmee   im glad laurie seems so happy and busy that he has given up smoking and lets his hair grow you see beth manages him better than i did im not jealous dear do your best only dont make a saint of him im afraid i couldnt like him without a spice of human naughtiness read him bits of my letters i havent time to write much and that will do just as well thank heaven beth continues so comfortable   january   a happy new year to you all my dearest family which of course includes mr l and a young man by the name of teddy i cant tell you how much i enjoyed your christmas bundle for i didnt get it till night and had given up hoping your letter came in the morning but you said nothing about a parcel meaning it for a surprise so i was disappointed for id had a kind of feeling that you wouldnt forget me i felt a little low in my mind as i sat up in my room after tea and when the big muddy batteredlooking bundle was brought to me i just hugged it and pranced it was so homey and refreshing that i sat down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried in my usual absurd way the things were just what i wanted and all the better for being made instead of bought beths new ink bib was capital and hannahs box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure ill be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent marmee and read carefully the books father has marked thank you all heaps and heaps   speaking of books reminds me that im getting rich in that line for on new years day mr bhaer gave me a fine shakespeare it is one he values much and ive often admired it set up in the place of honor with his german bible plato homer and milton so you may imagine how i felt when he brought it down without its cover and showed me my own name in it from my friend friedrich bhaer   you say often you wish a library here i gif you one for between these lids he meant covers is many books in one read him well and he will help you much for the study of character in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen   i thanked him as well as i could and talk now about my library as if i had a hundred books i never knew how much there was in shakespeare before but then i never had a bhaer to explain it to me now dont laugh at his horrid name it isnt pronounced either bear or beer as people will say it but something between the two as only germans can give it im glad you both like what i tell you about him and hope you will know him some day mother would admire his warm heart father his wise head i admire both and feel rich in my new friend friedrich bhaer   not having much money or knowing what hed like i got several little things and put them about the room where he would find them unexpectedly they were useful pretty or funny a new standish on his table a little vase for his flower he always has one or a bit of green in a glass to keep him fresh he says and a holder for his blower so that he neednt burn up what amy calls mouchoirs i made it like those beth invented a big butterfly with a fat body and black and yellow wings worsted feelers and bead eyes it took his fancy immensely and he put it on his mantlepiece as an article of virtue so it was rather a failure after all poor as he is he didnt forget a servant or a child in the house and not a soul here from the french laundrywoman to miss norton forgot him i was so glad of that   they got up a masquerade and had a gay time new years eve i didnt mean to go down having no dress but at the last minute mrs kirke remembered some old brocades and miss norton lent me lace and feathers so i dressed up as mrs malaprop and sailed in with a mask on no one knew me for i disguised my voice and no one dreamed of the silent haughty miss march for they think i am very stiff and cool most of them and so i am to whippersnappers could dance and dress and burst out into a nice derangement of epitaphs like an allegory on the banks of the nile i enjoyed it very much and when we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me i heard one of the young men tell another that he knew id been an actress in fact he thought he remembered seeing me at one of the minor theaters meg will relish that joke mr bhaer was nick bottom and tina was titania a perfect little fairy in his arms to see them dance was quite a landscape to use a teddyism   i had a very happy new year after all and when i thought it over in my room i felt as if i was getting on a little in spite of my many failures for im cheerful all the time now work with a will and take more interest in other people than i used to which is satisfactory bless you all ever your loving jo     chapter thirtyfour friend   though very happy in the social atmosphere about her and very busy with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the effort jo still found time for literary labors the purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl but the means she took to gain her end were not the best she saw that money conferred power money and power therefore she resolved to have not to be used for herself alone but for those whom she loved more than life the dream of filling home with comforts giving beth everything she wanted from strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom going abroad herself and always having more than enough so that she might indulge in the luxury of charity had been for years jos most cherished castle in the air  the prizestory experience had seemed to open a way which might after long traveling and much uphill work lead to this delightful chateau en espagne but the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time for public opinion is a giant which has frightened stouterhearted jacks on bigger beanstalks than hers like that immortal hero she reposed awhile after the first attempt which resulted in a tumble and the least lovely of the giants treasures if i remember rightly but the up again and take another spirit was as strong in jo as in jack so she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more booty but nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the moneybags  she took to writing sensation stories for in those dark ages even allperfect america read rubbish she told no one but concocted a thrilling tale and boldly carried it herself to mr dashwood editor of the weekly volcano she had never read sartor resartus but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners so she dressed herself in her best and trying to persuade herself that she was neither excited nor nervous bravely climbed two pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room a cloud of cigar smoke and the presence of three gentlemen sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats which articles of dress none of them took the trouble to remove on her appearance somewhat daunted by this reception jo hesitated on the threshold murmuring in much embarrassment  excuse me i was looking for the weekly volcano office i wished to see mr dashwood  down went the highest pair of heels up rose the smokiest gentleman and carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers he advanced with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep feeling that she must get through the matter somehow jo produced her manuscript and blushing redder and redder with each sentence blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion  a friend of mine desired me to offera storyjust as an experimentwould like your opinionbe glad to write more if this suits  while she blushed and blundered mr dashwood had taken the manuscript and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers and casting critical glances up and down the neat pages  not a first attempt i take it observing that the pages were numbered covered only on one side and not tied up with a ribbonsure sign of a novice  no sir she has had some experience and got a prize for a tale in the blarneystone banner  oh did she and mr dashwood gave jo a quick look which seemed to take note of everything she had on from the bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots well you can leave it if you like weve more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present but ill run my eye over it and give you an answer next week  now jo did not like to leave it for mr dashwood didnt suit her at all but under the circumstances there was nothing for her to do but bow and walk away looking particularly tall and dignified as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed just then she was both for it was perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen that her little fiction of my friend was considered a good joke and a laugh produced by some inaudible remark of the editor as he closed the door completed her discomfiture half resolving never to return she went home and worked off her irritation by stitching pinafores vigorously and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh over the scene and long for next week  when she went again mr dashwood was alone whereat she rejoiced mr dashwood was much wider awake than before which was agreeable and mr dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners so the second interview was much more comfortable than the first  well take this editors never say i if you dont object to a few alterations its too long but omitting the passages ive marked will make it just the right length he said in a businesslike tone  jo hardly knew her own ms again so crumpled and underscored were its pages and paragraphs but feeling as a tender parent might on being asked to cut off her babys legs in order that it might fit into a new cradle she looked at the marked passages and was surprised to find that all the moral reflectionswhich she had carefully put in as ballast for much romancehad been stricken out  but sir i thought every story should have some sort of a moral so i took care to have a few of my sinners repent  mr dashwoodss editorial gravity relaxed into a smile for jo had forgotten her friend and spoken as only an author could  people want to be amused not preached at you know morals dont sell nowadays which was not quite a correct statement by the way  you think it would do with these alterations then  yes its a new plot and pretty well worked uplanguage good and so on was mr dashwoods affable reply  what do youthat is what compensation began jo not exactly knowing how to express herself  oh yes well we give from twentyfive to thirty for things of this sort pay when it comes out returned mr dashwood as if that point had escaped him such trifles do escape the editorial mind it is said  very well you can have it said jo handing back the story with a satisfied air for after the dollaracolumn work even twentyfive seemed good pay  shall i tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than this asked jo unconscious of her little slip of the tongue and emboldened by her success  well well look at it cant promise to take it tell her to make it short and spicy and never mind the moral what name would your friend like to put on it in a careless tone  none at all if you please she doesnt wish her name to appear and has no nom de plume said jo blushing in spite of herself  just as she likes of course the tale will be out next week will you call for the money or shall i send it asked mr dashwood who felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor might be  ill call good morning sir  as she departed mr dashwood put up his feet with the graceful remark poor and proud as usual but shell do  following mr dashwoods directions and making mrs northbury her model jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational literature but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend she came up again not much the worse for her ducking  like most young scribblers she went abroad for her characters and scenery and banditti counts gypsies nuns and duchesses appeared upon her stage and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit as could be expected her readers were not particular about such trifles as grammar punctuation and probability and mr dashwood graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices not thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks on being offered higher wages had basely left him in the lurch  she soon became interested in her work for her emaciated purse grew stout and the little hoard she was making to take beth to the mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed one thing disturbed her satisfaction and that was that she did not tell them at home she had a feeling that father and mother would not approve and preferred to have her own way first and beg pardon afterward it was easy to keep her secret for no name appeared with her stories mr dashwood had of course found it out very soon but promised to be dumb and for a wonder kept his word  she thought it would do her no harm for she sincerely meant to write nothing of which she would be ashamed and quieted all pricks of conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her earnings and laugh over her wellkept secret  but mr dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales and as thrills could not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers history and romance land and sea science and art police records and lunatic asylums had to be ransacked for the purpose jo soon found that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world which underlies society so regarding it in a business light she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy eager to find material for stories and bent on making them original in plot if not masterly in execution she searched newspapers for accidents incidents and crimes she excited the suspicions of public librarians by asking for works on poisons she studied faces in the street and characters good bad and indifferent all about her she delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they were as good as new and introduced herself to folly sin and misery as well as her limited opportunities allowed she thought she was prospering finely but unconsciously she was beginning to desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a womans character she was living in bad society and imaginary though it was its influence affected her for she was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food and was fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side of life which comes soon enough to all of us  she was beginning to feel rather than see this for much describing of other peoples passions and feelings set her to studying and speculating about her own a morbid amusement in which healthy young minds do not voluntarily indulge wrongdoing always brings its own punishment and when jo most needed hers she got it  i dont know whether the study of shakespeare helped her to read character or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest brave and strong but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every perfection under the sun jo was discovering a live hero who interested her in spite of many human imperfections mr bhaer in one of their conversations had advised her to study simple true and lovely characters wherever she found them as good training for a writer jo took him at his word for she coolly turned round and studied hima proceeding which would have much surprised him had he known it for the worthy professor was very humble in his own conceit  why everybody liked him was what puzzled jo at first he was neither rich nor great young nor handsome in no respect what is called fascinating imposing or brilliant and yet he was as attractive as a genial fire and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about a warm hearth he was poor yet always appeared to be giving something away a stranger yet everyone was his friend no longer young but as happyhearted as a boy plain and peculiar yet his face looked beautiful to many and his oddities were freely forgiven for his sake jo often watched him trying to discover the charm and at last decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle if he had any sorrow it sat with its head under its wing and he turned only his sunny side to the world there were lines upon his forehead but time seemed to have touched him gently remembering how kind he was to others the pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many friendly words and cheery laughs his eyes were never cold or hard and his big hand had a warm strong grasp that was more expressive than words  his very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the wearer they looked as if they were at ease and liked to make him comfortable his capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart underneath his rusty coat had a social air and the baggy pockets plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full his very boots were benevolent and his collars never stiff and raspy like other peoples  thats it said jo to herself when she at length discovered that genuine good will toward ones fellow men could beautify and dignify even a stout german teacher who shoveled in his dinner darned his own socks and was burdened with the name of bhaer  jo valued goodness highly but she also possessed a most feminine respect for intellect and a little discovery which she made about the professor added much to her regard for him he never spoke of himself and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much honored and esteemed for learning and integrity till a countryman came to see him he never spoke of himself and in a conversation with miss norton divulged the pleasing fact from her jo learned it and liked it all the better because mr bhaer had never told it she felt proud to know that he was an honored professor in berlin though only a poor languagemaster in america and his homely hardworking life was much beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most unexpected manner miss norton had the entree into most society which jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her the solitary woman felt an interest in the ambitious girl and kindly conferred many favors of this sort both on jo and the professor she took them with her one night to a select symposium held in honor of several celebrities  jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off but her reverence for genius received a severe shock that night and it took her some time to recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and women after all imagine her dismay on stealing a glance of timid admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on spirit fire and dew to behold him devouring his supper with an ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance turning as from a fallen idol she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her romantic illusions the great novelist vibrated between two decanters with the regularity of a pendulum the famous divine flirted openly with one of the madame de staels of the age who looked daggers at another corinne who was amiably satirizing her after outmaneuvering her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher who imbibed tea johnsonianly and appeared to slumber the loquacity of the lady rendering speech impossible the scientific celebrities forgetting their mollusks and glacial periods gossiped about art while devoting themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy the young musician who was charming the city like a second orpheus talked horses and the specimen of the british nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of the party  before the evening was half over jo felt so completely disillusioned that she sat down in a corner to recover herself mr bhaer soon joined her looking rather out of his element and presently several of the philosophers each mounted on his hobby came ambling up to hold an intellectual tournament in the recess the conversations were miles beyond jos comprehension but she enjoyed it though kant and hegel were unknown gods the subjective and objective unintelligible terms and the only thing evolved from her inner consciousness was a bad headache after it was all over it dawned upon her gradually that the world was being picked to pieces and put together on new and according to the talkers on infinitely better principles than before that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness and intellect was to be the only god jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any sort but a curious excitement half pleasurable half painful came over her as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift into time and space like a young balloon out on a holiday  she looked round to see how the professor liked it and found him looking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear he shook his head and beckoned her to come away but she was fascinated just then by the freedom of speculative philosophy and kept her seat trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs  now mr bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions not because they were unsettled but too sincere and earnest to be lightly spoken as he glanced from jo to several other young people attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics he knit his brows and longed to speak fearing that some inflammable young soul would be led astray by the rockets to find when the display was over that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand  he bore it as long as he could but when he was appealed to for an opinion he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion with all the eloquence of truthan eloquence which made his broken english musical and his plain face beautiful he had a hard fight for the wise men argued well but he didnt know when he was beaten and stood to his colors like a man somehow as he talked the world got right again to jo the old beliefs that had lasted so long seemed better than the new god was not a blind force and immortality was not a pretty fable but a blessed fact she felt as if she had solid ground under her feet again and when mr bhaer paused outtalked but not one whit convinced jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him  she did neither but she remembered the scene and gave the professor her heartiest respect for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out then and there because his conscience would not let him be silent she began to see that character is a better possession than money rank intellect or beauty and to feel that if greatness is what a wise man has defined it to be truth reverence and good will then her friend friedrich bhaer was not only good but great  this belief strengthened daily she valued his esteem she coveted his respect she wanted to be worthy of his friendship and just when the wish was sincerest she came near to losing everything it all grew out of a cocked hat for one evening the professor came in to give jo her lesson with a paper soldier cap on his head which tina had put there and he had forgotten to take off  its evident he doesnt look in his glass before coming down thought jo with a smile as he said goot efening and sat soberly down quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his headgear for he was going to read her the death of wallenstein  she said nothing at first for she liked to hear him laugh out his big hearty laugh when anything funny happened so she left him to discover it for himself and presently forgot all about it for to hear a german read schiller is rather an absorbing occupation after the reading came the lesson which was a lively one for jo was in a gay mood that night and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment the professor didnt know what to make of her and stopped at last to ask with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible    mees marsch for what do you laugh in your masters face haf you no respect for me that you go on so bad  how can i be respectful sir when you forget to take your hat off said jo  lifting his hand to his head the absentminded professor gravely felt and removed the little cocked hat looked at it a minute and then threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol  ah i see him now it is that imp tina who makes me a fool with my cap well it is nothing but see you if this lesson goes not well you too shall wear him  but the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because mr bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat and unfolding it said with great disgust i wish these papers did not come in the house they are not for children to see nor young people to read it is not well and i haf no patience with those who make this harm  jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a lunatic a corpse a villain and a viper she did not like it but the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but fear because for a minute she fancied the paper was the volcano it was not however and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if it had been and one of her own tales in it there would have been no name to betray her she had betrayed herself however by a look and a blush for though an absent man the professor saw a good deal more than people fancied he knew that jo wrote and had met her down among the newspaper offices more than once but as she never spoke of it he asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work now it occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own and it troubled him he did not say to himself it is none of my business ive no right to say anything as many people would have done he only remembered that she was young and poor a girl far away from mothers love and fathers care and he was moved to help her with an impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to save a baby from a puddle all this flashed through his mind in a minute but not a trace of it appeared in his face and by the time the paper was turned and jos needle threaded he was ready to say quite naturally but very gravely  yes you are right to put it from you i do not think that good young girls should see such things they are made pleasant to some but i would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad trash  all may not be bad only silly you know and if there is a demand for it i dont see any harm in supplying it many very respectable people make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories said jo scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits followed her pin  there is a demand for whisky but i think you and i do not care to sell it if the respectable people knew what harm they did they would not feel that the living was honest they haf no right to put poison in the sugarplum and let the small ones eat it no they should think a little and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing  mr bhaer spoke warmly and walked to the fire crumpling the paper in his hands jo sat still looking as if the fire had come to her for her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and gone harmlessly up the chimney  i should like much to send all the rest after him muttered the professor coming back with a relieved air  jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make and her hardearned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute then she thought consolingly to herself mine are not like that they are only silly never bad so i wont be worried and taking up her book she said with a studious face shall we go on sir ill be very good and proper now  i shall hope so was all he said but he meant more than she imagined and the grave kind look he gave her made her feel as if the words weekly volcano were printed in large type on her forehead  as soon as she went to her room she got out her papers and carefully reread every one of her stories being a little shortsighted mr bhaer sometimes used eye glasses and jo had tried them once smiling to see how they magnified the fine print of her book now she seemed to have on the professors mental or moral spectacles also for the faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her with dismay  they are trash and will soon be worse trash if i go on for each is more sensational than the last ive gone blindly on hurting myself and other people for the sake of money i know its so for i cant read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it and what should i do if they were seen at home or mr bhaer got hold of them  jo turned hot at the bare idea and stuffed the whole bundle into her stove nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze  yes thats the best place for such inflammable nonsense id better burn the house down i suppose than let other people blow themselves up with my gunpowder she thought as she watched the demon of the jura whisk away a little black cinder with fiery eyes  but when nothing remained of all her three months work except a heap of ashes and the money in her lap jo looked sober as she sat on the floor wondering what she ought to do about her wages  i think i havent done much harm yet and may keep this to pay for my time she said after a long meditation adding impatiently i almost wish i hadnt any conscience its so inconvenient if i didnt care about doing right and didnt feel uncomfortable when doing wrong i should get on capitally i cant help wishing sometimes that mother and father hadnt been so particular about such things  ah jo instead of wishing that thank god that father and mother were particular and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to impatient youth but which will prove sure foundations to build character upon in womanhood  jo wrote no more sensational stories deciding that the money did not pay for her share of the sensation but going to the other extreme as is the way with people of her stamp she took a course of mrs sherwood miss edgeworth and hannah more and then produced a tale which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon so intensely moral was it she had her doubts about it from the beginning for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and cumbrous costume of the last century she sent this didactic gem to several markets but it found no purchaser and she was inclined to agree with mr dashwood that morals didnt sell  then she tried a childs story which she could easily have disposed of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it the only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to convert all the world to his particular belief but much as she liked to write for children jo could not consent to depict all her naughty boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did not go to a particular sabbath school nor all the good infants who did go as rewarded by every kind of bliss from gilded gingerbread to escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons on their lisping tongues so nothing came of these trials and jo corked up her inkstand and said in a fit of very wholesome humility  i dont know anything ill wait until i do before i try again and meantime sweep mud in the street if i cant do better thats honest at least which decision proved that her second tumble down the beanstalk had done her some good  while these internal revolutions were going on her external life had been as busy and uneventful as usual and if she sometimes looked serious or a little sad no one observed it but professor bhaer he did it so quietly that jo never knew he was watching to see if she would accept and profit by his reproof but she stood the test and he was satisfied for though no words passed between them he knew that she had given up writing not only did he guess it by the fact that the second finger of her right hand was no longer inky but she spent her evenings downstairs now was met no more among newspaper offices and studied with a dogged patience which assured him that she was bent on occupying her mind with something useful if not pleasant  he helped her in many ways proving himself a true friend and jo was happy for while her pen lay idle she was learning other lessons besides german and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her own life  it was a pleasant winter and a long one for she did not leave mrs kirke till june everyone seemed sorry when the time came the children were inconsolable and mr bhaers hair stuck straight up all over his head for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind  going home ah you are happy that you haf a home to go in he said when she told him and sat silently pulling his beard in the corner while she held a little levee on that last evening  she was going early so she bade them all goodbye overnight and when his turn came she said warmly now sir you wont forget to come and see us if you ever travel our way will you ill never forgive you if you do for i want them all to know my friend  do you shall i come he asked looking down at her with an eager expression which she did not see  yes come next month laurie graduates then and youd enjoy commencement as something new  that is your best friend of whom you speak he said in an altered tone  yes my boy teddy im very proud of him and should like you to see him  jo looked up then quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another something in mr bhaers face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find laurie more than a best friend and simply because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was the matter she involuntarily began to blush and the more she tried not to the redder she grew if it had not been for tina on her knee she didnt know what would have become of her fortunately the child was moved to hug her so she managed to hide her face an instant hoping the professor did not see it but he did and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression as he said cordially  i fear i shall not make the time for that but i wish the friend much success and you all happiness gott bless you and with that he shook hands warmly shouldered tina and went away  but after the boys were abed he sat long before his fire with the tired look on his face and the heimweh or homesickness lying heavy at his heart once when he remembered jo as she sat with the little child in her lap and that new softness in her face he leaned his head on his hands a minute and then roamed about the room as if in search of something that he could not find  it is not for me i must not hope it now he said to himself with a sigh that was almost a groan then as if reproaching himself for the longing that he could not repress he went and kissed the two tousled heads upon the pillow took down his seldomused meerschaum and opened his plato  he did his best and did it manfully but i dont think he found that a pair of rampant boys a pipe or even the divine plato were very satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home  early as it was he was at the station next morning to see jo off and thanks to him she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell a bunch of violets to keep her company and best of all the happy thought well the winters gone and ive written no books earned no fortune but ive made a friend worth having and ill try to keep him all my life     chapter thirtyfive heartache   whatever his motive might have been laurie studied to some purpose that year for he graduated with honor and gave the latin oration with the grace of a phillips and the eloquence of a demosthenes so his friends said they were all there his grandfatheroh so proudmr and mrs march john and meg jo and beth and all exulted over him with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time but fail to win from the world by any aftertriumphs  ive got to stay for this confounded supper but i shall be home early tomorrow youll come and meet me as usual girls laurie said as he put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over he said girls but he meant jo for she was the only one who kept up the old custom she had not the heart to refuse her splendid successful boy anything and answered warmly  ill come teddy rain or shine and march before you playing hail the conquering hero comes on a jewsharp  laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden panic oh deary me i know hell say something and then what shall i do  evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears and having decided that she wouldnt be vain enough to think people were going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her answer would be she set forth at the appointed time hoping teddy wouldnt do anything to make her hurt his poor feelings a call at megs and a refreshing sniff and sip at the daisy and demijohn still further fortified her for the teteatete but when she saw a stalwart figure looming in the distance she had a strong desire to turn about and run away  wheres the jewsharp jo cried laurie as soon as he was within speaking distance  i forgot it and jo took heart again for that salutation could not be called loverlike  she always used to take his arm on these occasions now she did not and he made no complaint which was a bad sign but talked on rapidly about all sorts of faraway subjects till they turned from the road into the little path that led homeward through the grove then he walked more slowly suddenly lost his fine flow of language and now and then a dreadful pause occurred to rescue the conversation from one of the wells of silence into which it kept falling jo said hastily now you must have a good long holiday  i intend to  something in his resolute tone made jo look up quickly to find him looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded moment had come and made her put out her hand with an imploring no teddy please dont  i will and you must hear me its no use jo weve got to have it out and the sooner the better for both of us he answered getting flushed and excited all at once  say what you like then ill listen said jo with a desperate sort of patience  laurie was a young lover but he was in earnest and meant to have it out if he died in the attempt so he plunged into the subject with characteristic impetuousity saying in a voice that would get choky now and then in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady  ive loved you ever since ive known you jo couldnt help it youve been so good to me ive tried to show it but you wouldnt let me now im going to make you hear and give me an answer for i cant go on so any longer  i wanted to save you this i thought youd understand began jo finding it a great deal harder than she expected  i know you did but the girls are so queer you never know what they mean they say no when they mean yes and drive a man out of his wits just for the fun of it returned laurie entrenching himself behind an undeniable fact  i dont i never wanted to make you care for me so and i went away to keep you from it if i could  i thought so it was like you but it was no use i only loved you all the more and i worked hard to please you and i gave up billiards and everything you didnt like and waited and never complained for i hoped youd love me though im not half good enough here there was a choke that couldnt be controlled so he decapitated buttercups while he cleared his confounded throat  you you are youre a great deal too good for me and im so grateful to you and so proud and fond of you i dont know why i cant love you as you want me to ive tried but i cant change the feeling and it would be a lie to say i do when i dont  really truly jo  he stopped short and caught both her hands as he put his question with a look that she did not soon forget  really truly dear  they were in the grove now close by the stile and when the last words fell reluctantly from jos lips laurie dropped her hands and turned as if to go on but for once in his life the fence was too much for him so he just laid his head down on the mossy post and stood so still that jo was frightened  oh teddy im sorry so desperately sorry i could kill myself if it would do any good i wish you wouldnt take it so hard i cant help it you know its impossible for people to make themselves love other people if they dont cried jo inelegantly but remorsefully as she softly patted his shoulder remembering the time when he had comforted her so long ago  they do sometimes said a muffled voice from the post i dont believe its the right sort of love and id rather not try it was the decided answer  there was a long pause while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow by the river and the tall grass rustled in the wind presently jo said very soberly as she sat down on the step of the stile laurie i want to tell you something  he started as if he had been shot threw up his head and cried out in a fierce tone dont tell me that jo i cant bear it now  tell what she asked wondering at his violence  that you love that old man  what old man demanded jo thinking he must mean his grandfather  that devilish professor you were always writing about if you say you love him i know i shall do something desperate and he looked as if he would keep his word as he clenched his hands with a wrathful spark in his eyes  jo wanted to laugh but restrained herself and said warmly for she too was getting excited with all this dont swear teddy he isnt old nor anything bad but good and kind and the best friend ive got next to you pray dont fly into a passion i want to be kind but i know i shall get angry if you abuse my professor i havent the least idea of loving him or anybody else  but you will after a while and then what will become of me  youll love someone else too like a sensible boy and forget all this trouble  i cant love anyone else and ill never forget you jo never never with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words  what shall i do with him sighed jo finding that emotions were more unmanagable than she expected you havent heard what i wanted to tell you sit down and listen for indeed i want to do right and make you happy she said hoping to soothe him with a little reason which proved that she knew nothing about love  seeing a ray of hope in that last speech laurie threw himself down on the grass at her feet leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile and looked up at her with an expectant face now that arrangement was not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on jos part for how could she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes full of love and longing and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or two her hardness of heart had wrung from him she gently turned his head away saying as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed to grow for her sakehow touching that was to be sure i agree with mother that you and i are not suited to each other because our quick tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable if we were so foolish as to jo paused a little over the last word but laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression  marryno we shouldnt if you loved me jo i should be a perfect saint for you could make me anything you like  no i cant ive tried and failed and i wont risk our happiness by such a serious experiment we dont agree and we never shall so well be good friends all our lives but we wont go and do anything rash  yes we will if we get the chance muttered laurie rebelliously  now do be reasonable and take a sensible view of the case implored jo almost at her wits end  i wont be reasonable i dont want to take what you call a sensible view it wont help me and it only makes it harder i dont believe youve got any heart  i wish i hadnt  there was a little quiver in jos voice and thinking it a good omen laurie turned round bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he said in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously wheedlesome before dont disappoint us dear everyone expects it grandpa has set his heart upon it your people like it and i cant get on without you say you will and lets be happy do do  not until months afterward did jo understand how she had the strength of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that she did not love her boy and never could it was very hard to do but she did it knowing that delay was both useless and cruel  i cant say yes truly so i wont say it at all youll see that im right byandby and thank me for it she began solemnly  ill be hanged if i do and laurie bounced up off the grass burning with indignation at the very idea  yes you will persisted jo youll get over this after a while and find some lovely accomplished girl who will adore you and make a fine mistress for your fine house i shouldnt im homely and awkward and odd and old and youd be ashamed of me and we should quarrelwe cant help it even now you seeand i shouldnt like elegant society and you would and youd hate my scribbling and i couldnt get on without it and we should be unhappy and wish we hadnt done it and everything would be horrid  anything more asked laurie finding it hard to listen patiently to this prophetic burst  nothing more except that i dont believe i shall ever marry im happy as i am and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to give it up for any mortal man  i know better broke in laurie you think so now but therell come a time when you will care for somebody and youll love him tremendously and live and die for him i know you will its your way and i shall have to stand by and see it and the despairing lover cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical if his face had not been so tragic  yes i will live and die for him if he ever comes and makes me love him in spite of myself and you must do the best you can cried jo losing patience with poor teddy ive done my best but you wont be reasonable and its selfish of you to keep teasing for what i cant give i shall always be fond of you very fond indeed as a friend but ill never marry you and the sooner you believe it the better for both of usso now  that speech was like gunpowder laurie looked at her a minute as if he did not quite know what to do with himself then turned sharply away saying in a desperate sort of tone youll be sorry some day jo  oh where are you going she cried for his face frightened her  to the devil was the consoling answer  for a minute jos heart stood still as he swung himself down the bank toward the river but it takes much folly sin or misery to send a young man to a violent death and laurie was not one of the weak sort who are conquered by a single failure he had no thought of a melodramatic plunge but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and coat into his boat and row away with all his might making better time up the river than he had done in any race jo drew a long breath and unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip the trouble which he carried in his heart  that will do him good and hell come home in such a tender penitent state of mind that i shant dare to see him she said adding as she went slowly home feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing and buried it under the leaves now i must go and prepare mr laurence to be very kind to my poor boy i wish hed love beth perhaps he may in time but i begin to think i was mistaken about her oh dear how can girls like to have lovers and refuse them i think its dreadful  being sure that no one could do it so well as herself she went straight to mr laurence told the hard story bravely through and then broke down crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind old gentleman though sorely disappointed did not utter a reproach he found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving laurie and hoped she would change her mind but he knew even better than jo that love cannot be forced so he shook his head sadly and resolved to carry his boy out of harms way for young impetuositys parting words to jo disturbed him more than he would confess  when laurie came home dead tired but quite composed his grandfather met him as if he knew nothing and kept up the delusion very successfully for an hour or two but when they sat together in the twilight the time they used to enjoy so much it was hard work for the old man to ramble on as usual and harder still for the young one to listen to praises of the last years success which to him now seemed like loves labor lost he bore it as long as he could then went to his piano and began to play the windows were open and jo walking in the garden with beth for once understood music better than her sister for he played the sonata pathetique and played it as he never did before  thats very fine i dare say but its sad enough to make one cry give us something gayer lad said mr laurence whose kind old heart was full of sympathy which he longed to show but knew not how  laurie dashed into a livelier strain played stormily for several minutes and would have got through bravely if in a momentary lull mrs marchs voice had not been heard calling jo dear come in i want you  just what laurie longed to say with a different meaning as he listened he lost his place the music ended with a broken chord and the musician sat silent in the dark  i cant stand this muttered the old gentleman up he got groped his way to the piano laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders and said as gently as a woman i know my boy i know  no answer for an instant then laurie asked sharply who told you  jo herself  then theres an end of it and he shook off his grandfathers hands with an impatient motion for though grateful for the sympathy his mans pride could not bear a mans pity  not quite i want to say one thing and then there shall be an end of it returned mr laurence with unusual mildness you wont care to stay at home now perhaps  i dont intend to run away from a girl jo cant prevent my seeing her and i shall stay and do it as long as i like interrupted laurie in a defiant tone  not if you are the gentleman i think you im disappointed but the girl cant help it and the only thing left for you to do is to go away for a time where will you go  anywhere i dont care what becomes of me and laurie got up with a reckless laugh that grated on his grandfathers ear  take it like a man and dont do anything rash for gods sake why not go abroad as you planned and forget it  i cant  but youve been wild to go and i promised you should when you got through college  ah but i didnt mean to go alone and laurie walked fast through the room with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see  i dont ask you to go alone theres someone ready and glad to go with you anywhere in the world  who sir stopping to listen  myself  laurie came back as quickly as he went and put out his hand saying huskily im a selfish brute butyou knowgrandfather  lord help me yes i do know for ive been through it all before once in my own young days and then with your father now my dear boy just sit quietly down and hear my plan its all settled and can be carried out at once said mr laurence keeping hold of the young man as if fearful that he would break away as his father had done before him  well sir what is it and laurie sat down without a sign of interest in face or voice  there is business in london that needs looking after i meant you should attend to it but i can do it better myself and things here will get on very well with brooke to manage them my partners do almost everything im merely holding on until you take my place and can be off at any time  but you hate traveling sir i cant ask it of you at your age began laurie who was grateful for the sacrifice but much preferred to go alone if he went at all  the old gentleman knew that perfectly well and particularly desired to prevent it for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices so stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind him he said stoutly bless your soul im not superannuated yet i quite enjoy the idea it will do me good and my old bones wont suffer for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as sitting in a chair  a restless movement from laurie suggested that his chair was not easy or that he did not like the plan and made the old man add hastily i dont mean to be a marplot or a burden i go because i think youd feel happier than if i was left behind i dont intend to gad about with you but leave you free to go where you like while i amuse myself in my own way ive friends in london and paris and should like to visit them meantime you can go to italy germany switzerland where you will and enjoy pictures music scenery and adventures to your hearts content  now laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and the world a howling wilderness but at the sound of certain words which the old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence the broken heart gave an unexpected leap and a green oasis or two suddenly appeared in the howling wilderness he sighed and then said in a spiritless tone just as you like sir it doesnt matter where i go or what i do  it does to me remember that my lad i give you entire liberty but i trust you to make an honest use of it promise me that laurie  anything you like sir  good thought the old gentleman you dont care now but therell come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief or im much mistaken  being an energetic individual mr laurence struck while the iron was hot and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel they were off during the time necessary for preparation laurie bore himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases he was moody irritable and pensive by turns lost his appetite neglected his dress and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano avoided jo but consoled himself by staring at her from his window with a tragic face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a heavy sense of guilt by day unlike some sufferers he never spoke of his unrequited passion and would allow no one not even mrs march to attempt consolation or offer sympathy on some accounts this was a relief to his friends but the weeks before his departure were very uncomfortable and everyone rejoiced that the poor dear fellow was going away to forget his trouble and come home happy of course he smiled darkly at their delusion but passed it by with the sad superiority of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was unalterable  when the parting came he affected high spirits to conceal certain inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves this gaiety did not impose upon anybody but they tried to look as if it did for his sake and he got on very well till mrs march kissed him with a whisper full of motherly solicitude then feeling that he was going very fast he hastily embraced them all round not forgetting the afflicted hannah and ran downstairs as if for his life jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round he did look round came back put his arms about her as she stood on the step above him and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal eloquent and pathetic  oh jo cant you  teddy dear i wish i could  that was all except a little pause then laurie straightened himself up said its all right never mind and went away without another word ah but it wasnt all right and jo did mind for while the curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer she felt as if she had stabbed her dearest friend and when he left her without a look behind him she knew that the boy laurie never would come again     chapter thirtysix beths secret   when jo came home that spring she had been struck with the change in beth no one spoke of it or seemed aware of it for it had come too gradually to startle those who saw her daily but to eyes sharpened by absence it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on jos heart as she saw her sisters face it was no paler and but littler thinner than in the autumn yet there was a strange transparent look about it as if the mortal was being slowly refined away and the immortal shining through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty jo saw and felt it but said nothing at the time and soon the first impression lost much of its power for beth seemed happy no one appeared to doubt that she was better and presently in other cares jo for a time forgot her fear  but when laurie was gone and peace prevailed again the vague anxiety returned and haunted her she had confessed her sins and been forgiven but when she showed her savings and proposed a mountain trip beth had thanked her heartily but begged not to go so far away from home another little visit to the seashore would suit her better and as grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies jo took beth down to the quiet place where she could live much in the open air and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little color into her pale cheeks  it was not a fashionable place but even among the pleasant people there the girls made few friends preferring to live for one another beth was too shy to enjoy society and jo too wrapped up in her to care for anyone else so they were all in all to each other and came and went quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about them who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the feeble one always together as if they felt instinctively that a long separation was not far away  they did feel it yet neither spoke of it for often between ourselves and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is very hard to overcome jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart and beths but when she put out her hand to lift it up there seemed something sacred in the silence and she waited for beth to speak she wondered and was thankful also that her parents did not seem to see what she saw and during the quiet weeks when the shadows grew so plain to her she said nothing of it to those at home believing that it would tell itself when beth came back no better she wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth and what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks with her head in jos lap while the winds blew healthfully over her and the sea made music at her feet  one day beth told her jo thought she was asleep she lay so still and putting down her book sat looking at her with wistful eyes trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on beths cheeks but she could not find enough to satisfy her for the cheeks were very thin and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells they had been collecting it came to her then more bitterly than ever that beth was slowly drifting away from her and her arms instinctively tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed for a minute her eyes were too dim for seeing and when they cleared beth was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say jo dear im glad you know it ive tried to tell you but i couldnt  there was no answer except her sisters cheek against her own not even tears for when most deeply moved jo did not cry she was the weaker then and beth tried to comfort and sustain her with her arms about her and the soothing words she whispered in her ear  ive known it for a good while dear and now im used to it it isnt hard to think of or to bear try to see it so and dont be troubled about me because its best indeed it is  is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn beth you did not feel it then and keep it to yourself so long did you asked jo refusing to see or say that it was best but glad to know that laurie had no part in beths trouble  yes i gave up hoping then but i didnt like to own it i tried to think it was a sick fancy and would not let it trouble anyone but when i saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans it was hard to feel that i could never be like you and then i was miserable jo  oh beth and you didnt tell me didnt let me comfort and help you how could you shut me out bear it all alone  jos voice was full of tender reproach and her heart ached to think of the solitary struggle that must have gone on while beth learned to say goodbye to health love and life and take up her cross so cheerfully  perhaps it was wrong but i tried to do right i wasnt sure no one said anything and i hoped i was mistaken it would have been selfish to frighten you all when marmee was so anxious about meg and amy away and you so happy with laurieat least i thought so then  and i thought you loved him beth and i went away because i couldnt cried jo glad to say all the truth  beth looked so amazed at the idea that jo smiled in spite of her pain and added softly then you didnt dearie i was afraid it was so and imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all that while  why jo how could i when he was so fond of you asked beth as innocently as a child i do love him dearly he is so good to me how can i help it but he could never be anything to me but my brother i hope he truly will be sometime  not through me said jo decidedly amy is left for him and they would suit excellently but i have no heart for such things now i dont care what becomes of anybody but you beth you must get well  i want to oh so much i try but every day i lose a little and feel more sure that i shall never gain it back its like the tide jo when it turns it goes slowly but it cant be stopped  it shall be stopped your tide must not turn so soon nineteen is too young beth i cant let you go ill work and pray and fight against it ill keep you in spite of everything there must be ways it cant be too late god wont be so cruel as to take you from me cried poor jo rebelliously for her spirit was far less piously submissive than beths  simple sincere people seldom speak much of their piety it shows itself in acts rather than in words and has more influence than homilies or protestations beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life and cheerfully wait for death like a confiding child she asked no questions but left everything to god and nature father and mother of us all feeling sure that they and they only could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come she did not rebuke jo with saintly speeches only loved her better for her passionate affection and clung more closely to the dear human love from which our father never means us to be weaned but through which he draws us closer to himself she could not say im glad to go for life was very sweet for her she could only sob out i try to be willing while she held fast to jo as the first bitter wave of this great sorrow broke over them together  by and by beth said with recovered serenity youll tell them this when we go home  i think they will see it without words sighed jo for now it seemed to her that beth changed every day  perhaps not ive heard that the people who love best are often blindest to such things if they dont see it you will tell them for me i dont want any secrets and its kinder to prepare them meg has john and the babies to comfort her but you must stand by father and mother wont you jo  if i can but beth i dont give up yet im going to believe that it is a sick fancy and not let you think its true said jo trying to speak cheerfully  beth lay a minute thinking and then said in her quiet way i dont know how to express myself and shouldnt try to anyone but you because i cant speak out except to my jo i only mean to say that i have a feeling that it never was intended i should live long im not like the rest of you i never made any plans about what id do when i grew up i never thought of being married as you all did i couldnt seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little beth trotting about at home of no use anywhere but there i never wanted to go away and the hard part now is the leaving you all im not afraid but it seems as if i should be homesick for you even in heaven  jo could not speak and for several minutes there was no sound but the sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide a whitewinged gull flew by with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast beth watched it till it vanished and her eyes were full of sadness a little graycoated sand bird came tripping over the beach peeping softly to itself as if enjoying the sun and sea it came quite close to beth and looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone dressing its wet feathers quite at home beth smiled and felt comforted for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed  dear little bird see jo how tame it is i like peeps better than the gulls they are not so wild and handsome but they seem happy confiding little things i used to call them my birds last summer and mother said they reminded her of mebusy quakercolored creatures always near the shore and always chirping that contented little song of theirs you are the gull jo strong and wild fond of the storm and the wind flying far out to sea and happy all alone meg is the turtledove and amy is like the lark she writes about trying to get up among the clouds but always dropping down into its nest again dear little girl shes so ambitious but her heart is good and tender and no matter how high she flies she never will forget home i hope i shall see her again but she seems so far away  she is coming in the spring and i mean that you shall be all ready to see and enjoy her im going to have you well and rosy by that time began jo feeling that of all the changes in beth the talking change was the greatest for it seemed to cost no effort now and she thought aloud in a way quite unlike bashful beth  jo dear dont hope any more it wont do any good im sure of that we wont be miserable but enjoy being together while we wait well have happy times for i dont suffer much and i think the tide will go out easily if you help me  jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face and with that silent kiss she dedicated herself soul and body to beth  she was right there was no need of any words when they got home for father and mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be saved from seeing tired with her short journey beth went at once to bed saying how glad she was to be home and when jo went down she found that she would be spared the hard task of telling beths secret her father stood leaning his head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she came in but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help and jo went to comfort her without a word     chapter thirtyseven new impressions   at three oclock in the afternoon all the fashionable world at nice may be seen on the promenade des anglaisa charming place for the wide walk bordered with palms flowers and tropical shrubs is bounded on one side by the sea on the other by the grand drive lined with hotels and villas while beyond lie orange orchards and the hills many nations are represented many languages spoken many costumes worn and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a carnival haughty english lively french sober germans handsome spaniards ugly russians meek jews freeandeasy americans all drive sit or saunter here chatting over the news and criticizing the latest celebrity who has arrivedristori or dickens victor emmanuel or the queen of the sandwich islands the equipages are as varied as the company and attract as much attention especially the low basket barouches in which ladies drive themselves with a pair of dashing ponies gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from overflowing the diminutive vehicles and little grooms on the perch behind  along this walk on christmas day a tall young man walked slowly with his hands behind him and a somewhat absent expression of countenance he looked like an italian was dressed like an englishman and had the independent air of an americana combination which caused sundry pairs of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him and sundry dandies in black velvet suits with rosecolored neckties buff gloves and orange flowers in their buttonholes to shrug their shoulders and then envy him his inches there were plenty of pretty faces to admire but the young man took little notice of them except to glance now and then at some blonde girl in blue presently he strolled out of the promenade and stood a moment at the crossing as if undecided whether to go and listen to the band in the jardin publique or to wander along the beach toward castle hill the quick trot of ponies feet made him look up as one of the little carriages containing a single young lady came rapidly down the street the lady was young blonde and dressed in blue he stared a minute then his whole face woke up and waving his hat like a boy he hurried forward to meet her  oh laurie is it really you i thought youd never come cried amy dropping the reins and holding out both hands to the great scandalization of a french mamma who hastened her daughters steps lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these mad english  i was detained by the way but i promised to spend christmas with you and here i am  how is your grandfather when did you come where are you staying  very welllast nightat the chauvain i called at your hotel but you were out  i have so much to say i dont know where to begin get in and we can talk at our ease i was going for a drive and longing for company flos saving up for tonight  what happens then a ball  a christmas party at our hotel there are many americans there and they give it in honor of the day youll go with us of course aunt will be charmed  thank you where now asked laurie leaning back and folding his arms a proceeding which suited amy who preferred to drive for her parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies backs afforded her infinite satisfaction  im going to the bankers first for letters and then to castle hill the view is so lovely and i like to feed the peacocks have you ever been there  often years ago but i dont mind having a look at it  now tell me all about yourself the last i heard of you your grandfather wrote that he expected you from berlin  yes i spent a month there and then joined him in paris where he has settled for the winter he has friends there and finds plenty to amuse him so i go and come and we get on capitally  thats a sociable arrangement said amy missing something in lauries manner though she couldnt tell what  why you see he hates to travel and i hate to keep still so we each suit ourselves and there is no trouble i am often with him and he enjoys my adventures while i like to feel that someone is glad to see me when i get back from my wanderings dirty old hole isnt it he added with a look of disgust as they drove along the boulevard to the place napoleon in the old city  the dirt is picturesque so i dont mind the river and the hills are delicious and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets are my delight now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass its going to the church of st john  while laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their canopies whiteveiled nuns bearing lighted tapers and some brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked amy watched him and felt a new sort of shyness steal over her for he was changed and she could not find the merryfaced boy she left in the moodylooking man beside her he was handsomer than ever and greatly improved she thought but now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over he looked tired and spiritlessnot sick nor exactly unhappy but older and graver than a year or two of prosperous life should have made him she couldnt understand it and did not venture to ask questions so she shook her head and touched up her ponies as the procession wound away across the arches of the paglioni bridge and vanished in the church  que pensezvous she said airing her french which had improved in quantity if not in quality since she came abroad  that mademoiselle has made good use of her time and the result is charming replied laurie bowing with his hand on his heart and an admiring look  she blushed with pleasure but somehow the compliment did not satisfy her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home when he promenaded round her on festival occasions and told her she was altogether jolly with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the head she didnt like the new tone for though not blase it sounded indifferent in spite of the look  if thats the way hes going to grow up i wish hed stay a boy she thought with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay  at avigdors she found the precious home letters and giving the reins to laurie read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road between green hedges where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in june  beth is very poorly mother says i often think i ought to go home but they all say stay so i do for i shall never have another chance like this said amy looking sober over one page  i think you are right there you could do nothing at home and it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy and enjoying so much my dear  he drew a little nearer and looked more like his old self as he said that and the fear that sometimes weighed on amys heart was lightened for the look the act the brotherly my dear seemed to assure her that if any trouble did come she would not be alone in a strange land presently she laughed and showed him a small sketch of jo in her scribbling suit with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap and issuing from her mouth the words genius burns  laurie smiled took it put it in his vest pocket to keep it from blowing away and listened with interest to the lively letter amy read him  this will be a regularly merry christmas to me with presents in the morning you and letters in the afternoon and a party at night said amy as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort and a flock of splendid peacocks came trooping about them tamely waiting to be fed while amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs to the brilliant birds laurie looked at her as she had looked at him with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had wrought he found nothing to perplex or disappoint much to admire and approve for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and manner she was as sprightly and graceful as ever with the addition of that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call elegance always mature for her age she had gained a certain aplomb in both carriage and conversation which made her seem more of a woman of the world than she was but her old petulance now and then showed itself her strong will still held its own and her native frankness was unspoiled by foreign polish  laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him and carried away a pretty little picture of a brightfaced girl standing in the sunshine which brought out the soft hue of her dress the fresh color of her cheeks the golden gloss of her hair and made her a prominent figure in the pleasant scene  as they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill amy waved her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt and said pointing here and there do you remember the cathedral and the corso the fishermen dragging their nets in the bay and the lovely road to villa franca schuberts tower just below and best of all that speck far out to sea which they say is corsica  i remember its not much changed he answered without enthusiasm  what jo would give for a sight of that famous speck said amy feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also  yes was all he said but he turned and strained his eyes to see the island which a greater usurper than even napoleon now made interesting in his sight  take a good look at it for her sake and then come and tell me what you have been doing with yourself all this while said amy seating herself ready for a good talk  but she did not get it for though he joined her and answered all her questions freely she could only learn that he had roved about the continent and been to greece so after idling away an hour they drove home again and having paid his respects to mrs carrol laurie left them promising to return in the evening  it must be recorded of amy that she deliberately prinked that night time and absence had done its work on both the young people she had seen her old friend in a new light not as our boy but as a handsome and agreeable man and she was conscious of a very natural desire to find favor in his sight amy knew her good points and made the most of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty woman  tarlatan and tulle were cheap at nice so she enveloped herself in them on such occasions and following the sensible english fashion of simple dress for young girls got up charming little toilettes with fresh flowers a few trinkets and all manner of dainty devices which were both inexpensive and effective it must be confessed that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman and indulged in antique coiffures statuesque attitudes and classic draperies but dear heart we all have our little weaknesses and find it easy to pardon such in the young who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness and keep our hearts merry with their artless vanities  i do want him to think i look well and tell them so at home said amy to herself as she put on flos old white silk ball dress and covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion out of which her white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect her hair she had the sense to let alone after gathering up the thick waves and curls into a hebelike knot at the back of her head  its not the fashion but its becoming and i cant afford to make a fright of myself she used to say when advised to frizzle puff or braid as the latest style commanded  having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion amy looped her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea and framed the white shoulders in delicate green vines remembering the painted boots she surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction and chasseed down the room admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself  my new fan just matches my flowers my gloves fit to a charm and the real lace on aunts mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress if i only had a classical nose and mouth i should be perfectly happy she said surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in each hand  in spite of this affliction she looked unusually gay and graceful as she glided away she seldom ranit did not suit her style she thought for being tall the stately and junoesque was more appropriate than the sportive or piquante she walked up and down the long saloon while waiting for laurie and once arranged herself under the chandelier which had a good effect upon her hair then she thought better of it and went away to the other end of the room as if ashamed of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one it so happened that she could not have done a better thing for laurie came in so quietly she did not hear him and as she stood at the distant window with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress the slender white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a wellplaced statue  good evening diana said laurie with the look of satisfaction she liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her  good evening apollo she answered smiling back at him for he too looked unusually debonair and the thought of entering the ballroom on the arm of such a personable man caused amy to pity the four plain misses davis from the bottom of her heart  here are your flowers i arranged them myself remembering that you didnt like what hannah calls a sotbookay said laurie handing her a delicate nosegay in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily passed it in cardiglias window  how kind you are she exclaimed gratefully if id known you were coming id have had something ready for you today though not as pretty as this im afraid  thank you it isnt what it should be but you have improved it he added as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist  please dont  i thought you liked that sort of thing  not from you it doesnt sound natural and i like your old bluntness better  im glad of it he answered with a look of relief then buttoned her gloves for her and asked if his tie was straight just as he used to do when they went to parties together at home  the company assembled in the long salle a manger that evening was such as one sees nowhere but on the continent the hospitable americans had invited every acquaintance they had in nice and having no prejudice against titles secured a few to add luster to their christmas ball  a russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk with a massive lady dressed like hamlets mother in black velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin a polish count aged eighteen devoted himself to the ladies who pronounced him a fascinating dear and a german serene something having come to supper alone roamed vaguely about seeking what he might devour baron rothschilds private secretary a largenosed jew in tight boots affably beamed upon the world as if his masters name crowned him with a golden halo a stout frenchman who knew the emperor came to indulge his mania for dancing and lady de jones a british matron adorned the scene with her little family of eight of course there were many lightfooted shrillvoiced american girls handsome lifelesslooking english ditto and a few plain but piquante french demoiselles likewise the usual set of traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily while mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly when they danced with their daughters  any young girl can imagine amys state of mind when she took the stage that night leaning on lauries arm she knew she looked well she loved to dance she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a ballroom and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by virtue of beauty youth and womanhood she did pity the davis girls who were awkward plain and destitute of escort except a grim papa and three grimmer maiden aunts and she bowed to them in her friendliest manner as she passed which was good of her as it permitted them to see her dress and burn with curiosity to know who her distinguishedlooking friend might be with the first burst of the band amys color rose her eyes began to sparkle and her feet to tap the floor impatiently for she danced well and wanted laurie to know it therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than described when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone do you care to dance  one usually does at a ball  her amazed look and quick answer caused laurie to repair his error as fast as possible  i meant the first dance may i have the honor  i can give you one if i put off the count he dances divinely but he will excuse me as you are an old friend said amy hoping that the name would have a good effect and show laurie that she was not to be trifled with  nice little boy but rather a short pole to support  a daughter of the gods devinely tall and most divinely fair   was all the satisfaction she got however  the set in which they found themselves was composed of english and amy was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion feeling all the while as if she could dance the tarantella with relish laurie resigned her to the nice little boy and went to do his duty to flo without securing amy for the joys to come which reprehensible want of forethought was properly punished for she immediately engaged herself till supper meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence she showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he strolled instead of rushed up to claim her for the next a glorious polka redowa but his polite regrets didnt impose upon her and when she galloped away with the count she saw laurie sit down by her aunt with an actual expression of relief  that was unpardonable and amy took no more notice of him for a long while except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between the dances for a necessary pin or a moments rest her anger had a good effect however for she hid it under a smiling face and seemed unusually blithe and brilliant lauries eyes followed her with pleasure for she neither romped nor sauntered but danced with spirit and grace making the delightsome pastime what it should be he very naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view and before the evening was half over had decided that little amy was going to make a very charming woman  it was a lively scene for soon the spirit of the social season took possession of everyone and christmas merriment made all faces shine hearts happy and heels light the musicians fiddled tooted and banged as if they enjoyed it everybody danced who could and those who couldnt admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth the air was dark with davises and many joneses gamboled like a flock of young giraffes the golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor with a dashing frenchwoman who carpeted the floor with her pink satin train the serene teuton found the suppertable and was happy eating steadily through the bill of fare and dismayed the garcons by the ravages he committed but the emperors friend covered himself with glory for he danced everything whether he knew it or not and introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him the boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold for though he carried weight he danced like an indiarubber ball he ran he flew he pranced his face glowed his bald head shown his coattails waved wildly his pumps actually twinkled in the air and when the music stopped he wiped the drops from his brow and beamed upon his fellow men like a french pickwick without glasses  amy and her pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more graceful agility and laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as indefatigably as if winged when little vladimir finally relinquished her with assurances that he was desolated to leave so early she was ready to rest and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment  it had been successful for at threeandtwenty blighted affections find a balm in friendly society and young nerves will thrill young blood dance and healthy young spirits rise when subjected to the enchantment of beauty light music and motion laurie had a wakedup look as he rose to give her his seat and when he hurried away to bring her some supper she said to herself with a satisfied smile ah i thought that would do him good  you look like balzacs femme peinte par ellememe he said as he fanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup in the other  my rouge wont come off and amy rubbed her brilliant cheek and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh outright  what do you call this stuff he asked touching a fold of her dress that had blown over his knee  illusion  good name for it its very prettynew thing isnt it  its as old as the hills you have seen it on dozens of girls and you never found out that it was pretty till nowstupide  i never saw it on you before which accounts for the mistake you see  none of that it is forbidden id rather take coffee than compliments just now no dont lounge it makes me nervous  laurie sat bold upright and meekly took her empty plate feeling an odd sort of pleasure in having little amy order him about for she had lost her shyness now and felt an irrestible desire to trample on him as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any signs of subjection  where did you learn all this sort of thing he asked with a quizzical look  as this sort of thing is rather a vague expression would you kindly explain returned amy knowing perfectly well what he meant but wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable  wellthe general air the style the selfpossession thetheillusionyou know laughed laurie breaking down and helping himself out of his quandary with the new word  amy was gratified but of course didnt show it and demurely answered foreign life polishes one in spite of ones self i study as well as play and as for thiswith a little gesture toward her dresswhy tulle is cheap posies to be had for nothing and i am used to making the most of my poor little things  amy rather regretted that last sentence fearing it wasnt in good taste but laurie liked her better for it and found himself both admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of opportunity and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly nor why he filled up her book with his own name and devoted himself to her for the rest of the evening in the most delightful manner but the impulse that wrought this agreeable change was the result of one of the new impressions which both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving     chapter thirtyeight on the shelf   in france the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married when vive la liberte becomes their motto in america as everyone knows girls early sign the declaration of independence and enjoy their freedom with republican zest but the young matrons usually abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion almost as close as a french nunnery though by no means as quiet whether they like it or not they are virtually put upon the shelf as soon as the wedding excitement is over and most of them might exclaim as did a very pretty woman the other day im as handsome as ever but no one takes any notice of me because im married  not being a belle or even a fashionable lady meg did not experience this affliction till her babies were a year old for in her little world primitive customs prevailed and she found herself more admired and beloved than ever  as she was a womanly little woman the maternal instinct was very strong and she was entirely absorbed in her children to the utter exclusion of everything and everybody else day and night she brooded over them with tireless devotion and anxiety leaving john to the tender mercies of the help for an irish lady now presided over the kitchen department being a domestic man john decidedly missed the wifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive but as he adored his babies he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored but three months passed and there was no return of repose meg looked worn and nervous the babies absorbed every minute of her time the house was neglected and kitty the cook who took life aisy kept him on short commons when he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma if he came gaily in at night eager to embrace his family he was quenched by a hush they are just asleep after worrying all day if he proposed a little amusement at home no it would disturb the babies if he hinted at a lecture or a concert he was answered with a reproachful look and a decidedleave my children for pleasure never his sleep was broken by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night his meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the presiding genius who deserted him halfhelped if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above and when he read his paper of an evening demis colic got into the shipping list and daisys fall affected the price of stocks for mrs brooke was only interested in domestic news  the poor man was very uncomfortable for the children had bereft him of his wife home was merely a nursery and the perpetual hushing made him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred precincts of babyland he bore it very patiently for six months and when no signs of amendment appeared he did what other paternal exiles dotried to get a little comfort elsewhere scott had married and gone to housekeeping not far off and john fell into the way of running over for an hour or two of an evening when his own parlor was empty and his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end mrs scott was a lively pretty girl with nothing to do but be agreeable and she performed her mission most successfully the parlor was always bright and attractive the chessboard ready the piano in tune plenty of gay gossip and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style  john would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so lonely but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and enjoyed his neighbors society  meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first and found it a relief to know that john was having a good time instead of dozing in the parlor or tramping about the house and waking the children but byandby when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep at proper hours leaving mamma time to rest she began to miss john and find her workbasket dull company when he was not sitting opposite in his old dressing gown comfortably scorching his slippers on the fender she would not ask him to stay at home but felt injured because he did not know that she wanted him without being told entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain she was nervous and worn out with watching and worry and in that unreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares oppress them want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness and too much devotion to that idol of american women the teapot makes them feel as if they were all nerve and no muscle  yes she would say looking in the glass im getting old and ugly john doesnt find me interesting any longer so he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor who has no incumbrances well the babies love me they dont care if i am thin and pale and havent time to crimp my hair they are my comfort and some day john will see what ive gladly sacrificed for them wont he my precious  to which pathetic appeal daisy would answer with a coo or demi with a crow and meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel which soothed her solitude for the time being but the pain increased as politics absorbed john who was always running over to discuss interesting points with scott quite unconscious that meg missed him not a word did she say however till her mother found her in tears one day and insisted on knowing what the matter was for megs drooping spirits had not escaped her observation  i wouldnt tell anyone except you mother but i really do need advice for if john goes on much longer i might as well be widowed replied mrs brooke drying her tears on daisys bib with an injured air  goes on how my dear asked her mother anxiously  hes away all day and at night when i want to see him he is continually going over to the scotts it isnt fair that i should have the hardest work and never any amusement men are very selfish even the best of them  so are women dont blame john till you see where you are wrong yourself  but it cant be right for him to neglect me  dont you neglect him  why mother i thought youd take my part  so i do as far as sympathizing goes but i think the fault is yours meg  i dont see how  let me show you did john ever neglect you as you call it while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening his only leisure time  no but i cant do it now with two babies to tend  i think you could dear and i think you ought may i speak quite freely and will you remember that its mother who blames as well as mother who sympathizes  indeed i will speak to me as if i were little meg again i often feel as if i needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for everything  meg drew her low chair beside her mothers and with a little interruption in either lap the two women rocked and talked lovingly together feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than ever  you have only made the mistake that most young wives makeforgotten your duty to your husband in your love for your children a very natural and forgivable mistake meg but one that had better be remedied before you take to different ways for children should draw you nearer than ever not separate you as if they were all yours and john had nothing to do but support them ive seen it for some weeks but have not spoken feeling sure it would come right in time  im afraid it wont if i ask him to stay hell think im jealous and i wouldnt insult him by such an idea he doesnt see that i want him and i dont know how to tell him without words  make it so pleasant he wont want to go away my dear hes longing for his little home but it isnt home without you and you are always in the nursery  oughtnt i to be there  not all the time too much confinement makes you nervous and then you are unfitted for everything besides you owe something to john as well as to the babies dont neglect husband for children dont shut him out of the nursery but teach him how to help in it his place is there as well as yours and the children need him let him feel that he has a part to do and he will do it gladly and faithfully and it will be better for you all  you really think so mother  i know it meg for ive tried it and i seldom give advice unless ive proved its practicability when you and jo were little i went on just as you are feeling as if i didnt do my duty unless i devoted myself wholly to you poor father took to his books after i had refused all offers of help and left me to try my experiment alone i struggled along as well as i could but jo was too much for me i nearly spoiled her by indulgence you were poorly and i worried about you till i fell sick myself then father came to the rescue quietly managed everything and made himself so helpful that i saw my mistake and never have been able to get on without him since that is the secret of our home happiness he does not let business wean him from the little cares and duties that affect us all and i try not to let domestic worries destroy my interest in his pursuits each do our part alone in many things but at home we work together always  it is so mother and my great wish is to be to my husband and children what you have been to yours show me how ill do anything you say  you always were my docile daughter well dear if i were you id let john have more to do with the management of demi for the boy needs training and its none too soon to begin then id do what i have often proposed let hannah come and help you she is a capital nurse and you may trust the precious babies to her while you do more housework you need the exercise hannah would enjoy the rest and john would find his wife again go out more keep cheerful as well as busy for you are the sunshinemaker of the family and if you get dismal there is no fair weather then id try to take an interest in whatever john likestalk with him let him read to you exchange ideas and help each other in that way dont shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman but understand what is going on and educate yourself to take your part in the worlds work for it all affects you and yours  john is so sensible im afraid he will think im stupid if i ask questions about politics and things  i dont believe he would love covers a multitude of sins and of whom could you ask more freely than of him try it and see if he doesnt find your society far more agreeable than mrs scotts suppers  i will poor john im afraid i have neglected him sadly but i thought i was right and he never said anything  he tried not to be selfish but he has felt rather forlorn i fancy this is just the time meg when young married people are apt to grow apart and the very time when they ought to be most together for the first tenderness soon wears off unless care is taken to preserve it and no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years of the little lives given to them to train dont let john be a stranger to the babies for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else and through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should now dear goodby think over mothers preachment act upon it if it seems good and god bless you all  meg did think it over found it good and acted upon it though the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it of course the children tyrannized over her and ruled the house as soon as they found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they wanted mamma was an abject slave to their caprices but papa was not so easily subjugated and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son for demi inherited a trifle of his sires firmness of character we wont call it obstinacy and when he made up his little mind to have or to do anything all the kings horses and all the kings men could not change that pertinacious little mind mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer his prejudices but papa believed that it never was too soon to learn obedience so master demi early discovered that when he undertook to wrastle with parpar he always got the worst of it yet like the englishman baby respected the man who conquered him and loved the father whose grave no no was more impressive than all mammas love pats  a few days after the talk with her mother meg resolved to try a social evening with john so she ordered a nice supper set the parlor in order dressed herself prettily and put the children to bed early that nothing should interfere with her experiment but unfortunately demis most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed and that night he decided to go on a rampage so poor meg sang and rocked told stories and tried every sleepprevoking wile she could devise but all in vain the big eyes wouldnt shut and long after daisy had gone to byelow like the chubby little bunch of good nature she was naughty demi lay staring at the light with the most discouragingly wideawake expression of countenance  will demi lie still like a good boy while mamma runs down and gives poor papa his tea asked meg as the hall door softly closed and the wellknown step went tiptoeing into the dining room  me has tea said demi preparing to join in the revel  no but ill save you some little cakies for breakfast if youll go byebye like daisy will you lovey  iss and demi shut his eyes tight as if to catch sleep and hurry the desired day  taking advantage of the propitious moment meg slipped away and ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow in her hair which was his especial admiration he saw it at once and said with pleased surprise why little mother how gay we are tonight do you expect company  only you dear  is it a birthday anniversary or anything  no im tired of being dowdy so i dressed up as a change you always make yourself nice for table no matter how tired you are so why shouldnt i when i have the time  i do it out of respect for you my dear said oldfashioned john  ditto ditto mr brooke laughed meg looking young and pretty again as she nodded to him over the teapot  well its altogether delightful and like old times this tastes right i drink your health dear and john sipped his tea with an air of reposeful rapture which was of very short duration however for as he put down his cup the door handle rattled mysteriously and a little voice was heard saying impatiently  opy doy mes tummin  its that naughty boy i told him to go to sleep alone and here he is downstairs getting his death acold pattering over that canvas said meg answering the call  mornin now announced demi in joyful tone as he entered with his long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table eyeing the cakies with loving glances  no it isnt morning yet you must go to bed and not trouble poor mamma then you can have the little cake with sugar on it  me loves parpar said the artful one preparing to climb the paternal knee and revel in forbidden joys but john shook his head and said to meg  if you told him to stay up there and go to sleep alone make him do it or he will never learn to mind you  yes of course come demi and meg led her son away feeling a strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as soon as they reached the nursery  nor was he disappointed for that shortsighted woman actually gave him a lump of sugar tucked him into his bed and forbade any more promenades till morning  iss said demi the perjured blissfully sucking his sugar and regarding his first attempt as eminently successful  meg returned to her place and supper was progressing pleasantly when the little ghost walked again and exposed the maternal delinquencies by boldly demanding more sudar marmar  now this wont do said john hardening his heart against the engaging little sinner we shall never know any peace till that child learns to go to bed properly you have made a slave of yourself long enough give him one lesson and then there will be an end of it put him in his bed and leave him meg  he wont stay there he never does unless i sit by him  ill manage him demi go upstairs and get into your bed as mamma bids you  sant replied the young rebel helping himself to the coveted cakie and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity  you must never say that to papa i shall carry you if you dont go yourself  go way me dont love parpar and demi retired to his mothers skirts for protection  but even that refuge proved unavailing for he was delivered over to the enemy with a be gentle with him john which struck the culprit with dismay for when mamma deserted him then the judgment day was at hand bereft of his cake defrauded of his frolic and borne away by a strong hand to that detested bed poor demi could not restrain his wrath but openly defied papa and kicked and screamed lustily all the way upstairs the minute he was put into bed on one side he rolled out on the other and made for the door only to be ignominiously caught up by the tail of his little toga and put back again which lively performance was kept up till the young mans strength gave out when he devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice this vocal exercise usually conquered meg but john sat as unmoved as the post which is popularly believed to be deaf no coaxing no sugar no lullaby no story even the light was put out and only the red glow of the fire enlivened the big dark which demi regarded with curiosity rather than fear this new order of things disgusted him and he howled dismally for marmar as his angry passions subsided and recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat the plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to megs heart and she ran up to say beseechingly  let me stay with him hell be good now john  no my dear ive told him he must go to sleep as you bid him and he must if i stay here all night  but hell cry himself sick pleaded meg reproaching herself for deserting her boy  no he wont hes so tired he will soon drop off and then the matter is settled for he will understand that he has got to mind dont interfere ill manage him  hes my child and i cant have his spirit broken by harshness  hes my child and i wont have his temper spoiled by indulgence go down my dear and leave the boy to me  when john spoke in that masterful tone meg always obeyed and never regretted her docility  please let me kiss him once john  certainly demi say good night to mamma and let her go and rest for she is very tired with taking care of you all day  meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory for after it was given demi sobbed more quietly and lay quite still at the bottom of the bed whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind  poor little man hes worn out with sleep and crying ill cover him up and then go and set megs heart at rest thought john creeping to the bedside hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep  but he wasnt for the moment his father peeped at him demis eyes opened his little chin began to quiver and he put up his arms saying with a penitent hiccough mes dood now  sitting on the stairs outside meg wondered at the long silence which followed the uproar and after imagining all sorts of impossible accidents she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest demi lay fast asleep not in his usual spreadeagle attitude but in a subdued bunch cuddled close in the circle of his fathers arm and holding his fathers finger as if he felt that justice was tempered with mercy and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby so held john had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold and while waiting had fallen asleep more tired by that tussle with his son than with his whole days work  as meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow she smiled to herself and then slipped away again saying in a satisfied tone i never need fear that john will be too harsh with my babies he does know how to manage them and will be a great help for demi is getting too much for me  when john came down at last expecting to find a pensive or reproachful wife he was agreeably surprised to find meg placidly trimming a bonnet and to be greeted with the request to read something about the election if he was not too tired john saw in a minute that a revolution of some kind was going on but wisely asked no questions knowing that meg was such a transparent little person she couldnt keep a secret to save her life and therefore the clue would soon appear he read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and then explained it in his most lucid manner while meg tried to look deeply interested to ask intelligent questions and keep her thoughts from wandering from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet in her secret soul however she decided that politics were as bad as mathematics and that the mission of politicians seemed to be calling each other names but she kept these feminine ideas to herself and when john paused shook her head and said with what she thought diplomatic ambiguity well i really dont see what we are coming to  john laughed and watched her for a minute as she poised a pretty little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand and regarded it with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken  she is trying to like politics for my sake so ill try and like millinery for hers thats only fair thought john the just adding aloud thats very pretty is it what you call a breakfast cap  my dear man its a bonnet my very best gotoconcertandtheater bonnet  i beg your pardon it was so small i naturally mistook it for one of the flyaway things you sometimes wear how do you keep it on  these bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud so and meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him with an air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible  its a love of a bonnet but i prefer the face inside for it looks young and happy again and john kissed the smiling face to the great detriment of the rosebud under the chin  im glad you like it for i want you to take me to one of the new concerts some night i really need some music to put me in tune will you please  of course i will with all my heart or anywhere else you like you have been shut up so long it will do you no end of good and i shall enjoy it of all things what put it into your head little mother  well i had a talk with marmee the other day and told her how nervous and cross and out of sorts i felt and she said i needed change and less care so hannah is to help me with the children and im to see to things about the house more and now and then have a little fun just to keep me from getting to be a fidgety brokendown old woman before my time its only an experiment john and i want to try it for your sake as much as for mine because ive neglected you shamefully lately and im going to make home what it used to be if i can you dont object i hope  never mind what john said or what a very narrow escape the little bonnet had from utter ruin all that we have any business to know is that john did not appear to object judging from the changes which gradually took place in the house and its inmates it was not all paradise by any means but everyone was better for the division of labor system the children throve under the paternal rule for accurate steadfast john brought order and obedience into babydom while meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of wholesome exercise a little pleasure and much confidential conversation with her sensible husband home grew homelike again and john had no wish to leave it unless he took meg with him the scotts came to the brookes now and everyone found the little house a cheerful place full of happiness content and family love even sallie moffatt liked to go there it is always so quiet and pleasant here it does me good meg she used to say looking about her with wistful eyes as if trying to discover the charm that she might use it in her great house full of splendid loneliness for there were no riotous sunnyfaced babies there and ned lived in a world of his own where there was no place for her  this household happiness did not come all at once but john and meg had found the key to it and each year of married life taught them how to use it unlocking the treasuries of real home love and mutual helpfulness which the poorest may possess and the richest cannot buy this is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent to be laid safe from the restless fret and fever of the world finding loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them undaunted by sorrow poverty or age walking side by side through fair and stormy weather with a faithful friend who is in the true sense of the good old saxon word the houseband and learning as meg learned that a womans happiest kingdom is home her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen but as a wise wife and mother     chapter thirtynine lazy laurence   laurie went to nice intending to stay a week and remained a month he was tired of wandering about alone and amys familiar presence seemed to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a part he rather missed the petting he used to receive and enjoyed a taste of it again for no attentions however flattering from strangers were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls at home amy never would pet him like the others but she was very glad to see him now and quite clung to him feeling that he was the representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she would confess they naturally took comfort in each others society and were much together riding walking dancing or dawdling for at nice no one can be very industrious during the gay season but while apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion they were halfconsciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each other amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend but he sank in hers and each felt the truth before a word was spoken amy tried to please and succeeded for she was grateful for the many pleasures he gave her and repaid him with the little services to which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable charm laurie made no effort of any kind but just let himself drift along as comfortably as possible trying to forget and feeling that all women owed him a kind word because one had been cold to him it cost him no effort to be generous and he would have given amy all the trinkets in nice if she would have taken them but at the same time he felt that he could not change the opinion she was forming of him and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such halfsorrowful halfscornful surprise  all the rest have gone to monaco for the day i preferred to stay at home and write letters they are done now and i am going to valrosa to sketch will you come said amy as she joined laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual about noon  well yes but isnt it rather warm for such a long walk he answered slowly for the shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without  im going to have the little carriage and baptiste can drive so youll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella and keep your gloves nice returned amy with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids which were a weak point with laurie  then ill go with pleasure and he put out his hand for her sketchbook but she tucked it under her arm with a sharp  dont trouble yourself its no exertion to me but you dont look equal to it  laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran downstairs but when they got into the carriage he took the reins himself and left little baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and fall asleep on his perch  the two never quarreled amy was too wellbred and just now laurie was too lazy so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an inquiring air she answered him with a smile and they went on together in the most amicable manner  it was a lovely drive along winding roads rich in the picturesque scenes that delight beautyloving eyes here an ancient monastery whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them there a barelegged shepherd in wooden shoes pointed hat and rough jacket over one shoulder sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet meek mousecolored donkeys laden with panniers of freshly cut grass passed by with a pretty girl in a capaline sitting between the green piles or an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went brown softeyed children ran out from the quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays or bunches of oranges still on the bough gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky foliage fruit hung golden in the orchard and great scarlet anemones fringed the roadside while beyond green slopes and craggy heights the maritime alps rose sharp and white against the blue italian sky  valrosa well deserved its name for in that climate of perpetual summer roses blossomed everywhere they overhung the archway thrust themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to passersby and lined the avenue winding through lemon trees and feathery palms up to the villa on the hill every shadowy nook where seats invited one to stop and rest was a mass of bloom every cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every fountain reflected crimson white or pale pink roses leaning down to smile at their own beauty roses covered the walls of the house draped the cornices climbed the pillars and ran riot over the balustrade of the wide terrace whence one looked down on the sunny mediterranean and the whitewalled city on its shore  this is a regular honeymoon paradise isnt it did you ever see such roses asked amy pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view and a luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by  no nor felt such thorns returned laurie with his thumb in his mouth after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that grew just beyond his reach  try lower down and pick those that have no thorns said amy gathering three of the tiny creamcolored ones that starred the wall behind her she put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering and he stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression for in the italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition and he was just then in that state of halfsweet halfbitter melancholy when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for romance everywhere he had thought of jo in reaching after the thorny red rose for vivid flowers became her and she had often worn ones like that from the greenhouse at home the pale roses amy gave him were the sort that the italians lay in dead hands never in bridal wreaths and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for jo or for himself but the next instant his american common sense got the better of sentimentality and he laughed a heartier laugh than amy had heard since he came  its good advice youd better take it and save your fingers she said thinking her speech amused him  thank you i will he answered in jest and a few months later he did it in earnest  laurie when are you going to your grandfather she asked presently as she settled herself on a rustic seat  very soon  you have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks  i dare say short answers save trouble  he expects you and you really ought to go  hospitable creature i know it  then why dont you do it  natural depravity i suppose  natural indolence you mean its really dreadful and amy looked severe  not so bad as it seems for i should only plague him if i went so i might as well stay and plague you a little longer you can bear it better in fact i think it agrees with you excellently and laurie composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade  amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of resignation but she had made up her mind to lecture that boy and in a minute she began again  what are you doing just now  watching lizards  no no i mean what do you intend and wish to do  smoke a cigarette if youll allow me  how provoking you are i dont approve of cigars and i will only allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch i need a figure  with all the pleasure in life how will you have me full length or threequarters on my head or my heels i should respectfully suggest a recumbent posture then put yourself in also and call it dolce far niente  stay as you are and go to sleep if you like i intend to work hard said amy in her most energetic tone  what delightful enthusiasm and he leaned against a tall urn with an air of entire satisfaction  what would jo say if she saw you now asked amy impatiently hoping to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sisters name  as usual go away teddy im busy he laughed as he spoke but the laugh was not natural and a shade passed over his face for the utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed yet both tone and shadow struck amy for she had seen and heard them before and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on lauries facea hard bitter look full of pain dissatisfaction and regret it was gone before she could study it and the listless expression back again she watched him for a moment with artistic pleasure thinking how like an italian he looked as he lay basking in the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess for he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie  you look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb she said carefully tracing the wellcut profile defined against the dark stone  wish i was  thats a foolish wish unless you have spoiled your life you are so changed i sometimes think there amy stopped with a halftimid halfwistful look more significant than her unfinished speech  laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated to express and looking straight into her eyes said just as he used to say it to her mother its all right maam  that satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry her lately it also touched her and she showed that it did by the cordial tone in which she said  im glad of that i didnt think youd been a very bad boy but i fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked badenbaden lost your heart to some charming frenchwoman with a husband or got into some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a foreign tour dont stay out there in the sun come and lie on the grass here and let us be friendly as jo used to say when we got in the sofa corner and told secrets  laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf and began to amuse himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of amys hat that lay there  im all ready for the secrets and he glanced up with a decided expression of interest in his eyes  ive none to tell you may begin  havent one to bless myself with i thought perhaps youd had some news from home  you have heard all that has come lately dont you hear often i fancied jo would send you volumes  shes very busy im roving about so its impossible to be regular you know when do you begin your great work of art raphaella he asked changing the subject abruptly after another pause in which he had been wondering if amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it  never she answered with a despondent but decided air rome took all the vanity out of me for after seeing the wonders there i felt too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair  why should you with so much energy and talent  thats just why because talent isnt genius and no amount of energy can make it so i want to be great or nothing i wont be a commonplace dauber so i dont intend to try any more  and what are you going to do with yourself now if i may ask  polish up my other talents and be an ornament to society if i get the chance  it was a characteristic speech and sounded daring but audacity becomes young people and amys ambition had a good foundation laurie smiled but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a longcherished one died and spent no time lamenting  good and here is where fred vaughn comes in i fancy  amy preserved a discreet silence but there was a conscious look in her downcast face that made laurie sit up and say gravely now im going to play brother and ask questions may i  i dont promise to answer  your face will if your tongue wont you arent woman of the world enough yet to hide your feelings my dear i heard rumors about fred and you last year and its my private opinion that if he had not been called home so suddenly and detained so long something would have come of it hey  thats not for me to say was amys grim reply but her lips would smile and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge  you are not engaged i hope and laurie looked very elderbrotherly and grave all of a sudden  no  but you will be if he comes back and goes properly down on his knees wont you  very likely  then you are fond of old fred  i could be if i tried  but you dont intend to try till the proper moment bless my soul what unearthly prudence hes a good fellow amy but not the man i fancied youd like  he is rich a gentleman and has delightful manners began amy trying to be quite cool and dignified but feeling a little ashamed of herself in spite of the sincerity of her intentions  i understand queens of society cant get on without money so you mean to make a good match and start in that way quite right and proper as the world goes but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your mothers girls  true nevertheless  a short speech but the quiet decision with which it was uttered contrasted curiously with the young speaker laurie felt this instinctively and laid himself down again with a sense of disappointment which he could not explain his look and silence as well as a certain inward selfdisapproval ruffled amy and made her resolve to deliver her lecture without delay  i wish youd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little she said sharply  do it for me theres a dear girl  i could if i tried and she looked as if she would like doing it in the most summary style  try then i give you leave returned laurie who enjoyed having someone to tease after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime  youd be angry in five minutes  im never angry with you it takes two flints to make a fire you are as cool and soft as snow  you dont know what i can do snow produces a glow and a tingle if applied rightly your indifference is half affectation and a good stirring up would prove it  stir away it wont hurt me and it may amuse you as the big man said when his little wife beat him regard me in the light of a husband or a carpet and beat till you are tired if that sort of exercise agrees with you  being decidedly nettled herself and longing to see him shake off the apathy that so altered him amy sharpened both tongue and pencil and began  flo and i have got a new name for you its lazy laurence how do you like it  she thought it would annoy him but he only folded his arms under his head with an imperturbable thats not bad thank you ladies  do you want to know what i honestly think of you  pining to be told  well i despise you  if she had even said i hate you in a petulant or coquettish tone he would have laughed and rather liked it but the grave almost sad accent in her voice made him open his eyes and ask quickly  why if you please  because with every chance for being good useful and happy you are faulty lazy and miserable  strong language mademoiselle  if you like it ill go on  pray do its quite interesting  i thought youd find it so selfish people always like to talk about themselves  am i selfish the question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of surprise for the one virtue on which he prided himself was generosity  yes very selfish continued amy in a calm cool voice twice as effective just then as an angry one ill show you how for ive studied you while we were frolicking and im not at all satisfied with you here you have been abroad nearly six months and done nothing but waste time and money and disappoint your friends  isnt a fellow to have any pleasure after a fouryear grind  you dont look as if youd had much at any rate you are none the better for it as far as i can see i said when we first met that you had improved now i take it all back for i dont think you half so nice as when i left you at home you have grown abominably lazy you like gossip and waste time on frivolous things you are contented to be petted and admired by silly people instead of being loved and respected by wise ones with money talent position health and beauty ah you like that old vanity but its the truth so i cant help saying it with all these splendid things to use and enjoy you can find nothing to do but dawdle and instead of being the man you ought to be you are only there she stopped with a look that had both pain and pity in it  saint laurence on a gridiron added laurie blandly finishing the sentence but the lecture began to take effect for there was a wideawake sparkle in his eyes now and a halfangry halfinjured expression replaced the former indifference  i supposed youd take it so you men tell us we are angels and say we can make you what we will but the instant we honestly try to do you good you laugh at us and wont listen which proves how much your flattery is worth amy spoke bitterly and turned her back on the exasperating martyr at her feet  in a minute a hand came down over the page so that she could not draw and lauries voice said with a droll imitation of a penitent child i will be good oh i will be good  but amy did not laugh for she was in earnest and tapping on the outspread hand with her pencil said soberly arent you ashamed of a hand like that its as soft and white as a womans and looks as if it never did anything but wear jouvins best gloves and pick flowers for ladies you are not a dandy thank heaven so im glad to see there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it only the little old one jo gave you so long ago dear soul i wish she was here to help me  so do i  the hand vanished as suddenly as it came and there was energy enough in the echo of her wish to suit even amy she glanced down at him with a new thought in her mind but he was lying with his hat half over his face as if for shade and his mustache hid his mouth she only saw his chest rise and fall with a long breath that might have been a sigh and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass as if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of all in a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in amys mind and told her what her sister never had confided to her she remembered that laurie never spoke voluntarily of jo she recalled the shadow on his face just now the change in his character and the wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome hand girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the alteration and now she was sure of it her keen eyes filled and when she spoke again it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so  i know i have no right to talk so to you laurie and if you werent the sweetesttempered fellow in the world youd be very angry with me but we are all so fond and proud of you i couldnt bear to think they should be disappointed in you at home as i have been though perhaps they would understand the change better than i do  i think they would came from under the hat in a grim tone quite as touching as a broken one  they ought to have told me and not let me go blundering and scolding when i should have been more kind and patient than ever i never did like that miss randal and now i hate her said artful amy wishing to be sure of her facts this time  hang miss randal and laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady  i beg pardon i thought and there she paused diplomatically  no you didnt you knew perfectly well i never cared for anyone but jo laurie said that in his old impetuous tone and turned his face away as he spoke  i did think so but as they never said anything about it and you came away i supposed i was mistaken and jo wouldnt be kind to you why i was sure she loved you dearly  she was kind but not in the right way and its lucky for her she didnt love me if im the goodfornothing fellow you think me its her fault though and you may tell her so  the hard bitter look came back again as he said that and it troubled amy for she did not know what balm to apply  i was wrong i didnt know im very sorry i was so cross but i cant help wishing youd bear it better teddy dear  dont thats her name for me and laurie put up his hand with a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in jos halfkind halfreproachful tone wait till youve tried it yourself he added in a low voice as he pulled up the grass by the handful  id take it manfully and be respected if i couldnt be loved said amy with the decision of one who knew nothing about it  now laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well making no moan asking no sympathy and taking his trouble away to live it down alone amys lecture put the matter in a new light and for the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first failure and shut himself up in moody indifference he felt as if suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to sleep again presently he sat up and asked slowly do you think jo would despise me as you do  yes if she saw you now she hates lazy people why dont you do something splendid and make her love you  i did my best but it was no use  graduating well you mean that was no more than you ought to have done for your grandfathers sake it would have been shameful to fail after spending so much time and money when everyone knew that you could do well  i did fail say what you will for jo wouldnt love me began laurie leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude  no you didnt and youll say so in the end for it did you good and proved that you could do something if you tried if youd only set about another task of some sort youd soon be your hearty happy self again and forget your trouble  thats impossible  try it and see you neednt shrug your shoulders and think much she knows about such things i dont pretend to be wise but i am observing and i see a great deal more than youd imagine im interested in other peoples experiences and inconsistencies and though i cant explain i remember and use them for my own benefit love jo all your days if you choose but dont let it spoil you for its wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you cant have the one you want there i wont lecture any more for i know youll wake up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl  neither spoke for several minutes laurie sat turning the little ring on his finger and amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had been working at while she talked presently she put it on his knee merely saying how do you like that  he looked and then he smiled as he could not well help doing for it was capitally done the long lazy figure on the grass with listless face halfshut eyes and one hand holding a cigar from which came the little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamers head  how well you draw he said with a genuine surprise and pleasure at her skill adding with a halflaugh yes thats me  as you are this is as you were and amy laid another sketch beside the one he held  it was not nearly so well done but there was a life and spirit in it which atoned for many faults and it recalled the past so vividly that a sudden change swept over the young mans face as he looked only a rough sketch of laurie taming a horse hat and coat were off and every line of the active figure resolute face and commanding attitude was full of energy and meaning the handsome brute just subdued stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein with one foot impatiently pawing the ground and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had mastered him in the ruffled mane the riders breezy hair and erect attitude there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion of strength courage and youthful buoyancy that contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the dolce far niente sketch laurie said nothing but as his eye went from one to the other amy saw him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little lesson she had given him that satisfied her and without waiting for him to speak she said in her sprightly way  dont you remember the day you played rarey with puck and we all looked on meg and beth were frightened but jo clapped and pranced and i sat on the fence and drew you i found that sketch in my portfolio the other day touched it up and kept it to show you  much obliged youve improved immensely since then and i congratulate you may i venture to suggest in a honeymoon paradise that five oclock is the dinner hour at your hotel  laurie rose as he spoke returned the pictures with a smile and a bow and looked at his watch as if to remind her that even moral lectures should have an end he tried to resume his former easy indifferent air but it was an affectation now for the rousing had been more effacious than he would confess amy felt the shade of coldness in his manner and said to herself  now ive offended him well if it does him good im glad if it makes him hate me im sorry but its true and i cant take back a word of it  they laughed and chatted all the way home and little baptiste up behind thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming spirits but both felt ill at ease the friendly frankness was disturbed the sunshine had a shadow over it and despite their apparent gaiety there was a secret discontent in the heart of each  shall we see you this evening mon frere asked amy as they parted at her aunts door  unfortunately i have an engagement au revoir madamoiselle and laurie bent as if to kiss her hand in the foreign fashion which became him better than many men something in his face made amy say quickly and warmly  no be yourself with me laurie and part in the good old way id rather have a hearty english handshake than all the sentimental salutations in france  goodbye dear and with these words uttered in the tone she liked laurie left her after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness  next morning instead of the usual call amy received a note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end  my dear mentor please make my adieux to your aunt and exult within yourself for lazy laurence has gone to his grandpa like the best of boys a pleasant winter to you and may the gods grant you a blissful honeymoon at valrosa i think fred would be benefited by a rouser tell him so with my congratulations   yours gratefully telemachus   good boy im glad hes gone said amy with an approving smile the next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room adding with an involuntary sigh yes i am glad but how i shall miss him     chapter forty the valley of the shadow   when the first bitterness was over the family accepted the inevitable and tried to bear it cheerfully helping one another by the increased affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of trouble they put away their grief and each did his or her part toward making that last year a happy one  the pleasantest room in the house was set apart for beth and in it was gathered everything that she most loved flowers pictures her piano the little worktable and the beloved pussies fathers best books found their way there mothers easy chair jos desk amys finest sketches and every day meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage to make sunshine for aunty beth john quietly set apart a little sum that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with the fruit she loved and longed for old hannah never wearied of concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite dropping tears as she worked and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful letters seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands that know no winter  here cherished like a household saint in its shrine sat beth tranquil and busy as ever for nothing could change the sweet unselfish nature and even while preparing to leave life she tried to make it happier for those who should remain behind the feeble fingers were never idle and one of her pleasures was to make little things for the school children daily passing to and fro to drop a pair of mittens from her window for a pair of purple hands a needlebook for some small mother of many dolls penwipers for young penmen toiling through forests of pothooks scrapbooks for pictureloving eyes and all manner of pleasant devices till the reluctant climbers of the ladder of learning found their way strewn with flowers as it were and came to regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy godmother who sat above there and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and needs if beth had wanted any reward she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her window with nods and smiles and the droll little letters which came to her full of blots and gratitude  the first few months were very happy ones and beth often used to look round and say how beautiful this is as they all sat together in her sunny room the babies kicking and crowing on the floor mother and sisters working near and father reading in his pleasant voice from the wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words as applicable now as when written centuries ago a little chapel where a paternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn trying to show them that hope can comfort love and faith make resignation possible simple sermons that went straight to the souls of those who listened for the fathers heart was in the ministers religion and the frequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he spoke or read  it was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as preparation for the sad hours to come for byandby beth said the needle was so heavy and put it down forever talking wearied her faces troubled her pain claimed her for its own and her tranquil spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble flesh ah me such heavy days such long long nights such aching hearts and imploring prayers when those who loved her best were forced to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly to hear the bitter cry help me help me and to feel that there was no help a sad eclipse of the serene soul a sharp struggle of the young life with death but both were mercifully brief and then the natural rebellion over the old peace returned more beautiful than ever with the wreck of her frail body beths soul grew strong and though she said little those about her felt that she was ready saw that the first pilgrim called was likewise the fittest and waited with her on the shore trying to see the shining ones coming to receive her when she crossed the river  jo never left her for an hour since beth had said i feel stronger when you are here she slept on a couch in the room waking often to renew the fire to feed lift or wait upon the patient creature who seldom asked for anything and tried not to be a trouble all day she haunted the room jealous of any other nurse and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her precious and helpful hours to jo for now her heart received the teaching that it needed lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn them charity for all the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly forget unkindness the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy and the sincere faith that fears nothing but trusts undoubtingly  often when she woke jo found beth reading in her wellworn little book heard her singing softly to beguile the sleepless night or saw her lean her face upon her hands while slow tears dropped through the transparent fingers and jo would lie watching her with thoughts too deep for tears feeling that beth in her simple unselfish way was trying to wean herself from the dear old life and fit herself for the life to come by sacred words of comfort quiet prayers and the music she loved so well  seeing this did more for jo than the wisest sermons the saintliest hymns the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter for with eyes made clear by many tears and a heart softened by the tenderest sorrow she recognized the beauty of her sisters lifeuneventful unambitious yet full of the genuine virtues which smell sweet and blossom in the dust the selfforgetfulness that makes the humblest on earth remembered soonest in heaven the true success which is possible to all  one night when beth looked among the books upon her table to find something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as hard to bear as pain as she turned the leaves of her old favorite pilgrimss progress she found a little paper scribbled over in jos hand the name caught her eye and the blurred look of the lines made her sure that tears had fallen on it  poor jo shes fast asleep so i wont wake her to ask leave she shows me all her things and i dont think shell mind if i look at this thought beth with a glance at her sister who lay on the rug with the tongs beside her ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart  my beth   sitting patient in the shadow till the blessed light shall come a serene and saintly presence sanctifies our troubled home earthly joys and hopes and sorrows break like ripples on the strand of the deep and solemn river where her willing feet now stand   o my sister passing from me out of human care and strife leave me as a gift those virtues which have beautified your life dear bequeath me that great patience which has power to sustain a cheerful uncomplaining spirit in its prisonhouse of pain   give me for i need it sorely of that courage wise and sweet which has made the path of duty green beneath your willing feet give me that unselfish nature that with charity divine can pardon wrong for loves dear sake meek heart forgive me mine   thus our parting daily loseth something of its bitter pain and while learning this hard lesson my great loss becomes my gain for the touch of grief will render my wild nature more serene give to life new aspirations a new trust in the unseen   henceforth safe across the river i shall see forever more a beloved household spirit waiting for me on the shore hope and faith born of my sorrow guardian angels shall become and the sister gone before me by their hands shall lead me home   blurred and blotted faulty and feeble as the lines were they brought a look of inexpressible comfort to beths face for her one regret had been that she had done so little and this seemed to assure her that her life had not been useless that her death would not bring the despair she feared as she sat with the paper folded between her hands the charred log fell asunder jo started up revived the blaze and crept to the bedside hoping beth slept  not asleep but so happy dear see i found this and read it i knew you wouldnt care have i been all that to you jo she asked with wistful humble earnestness  oh beth so much so much and jos head went down upon the pillow beside her sisters  then i dont feel as if id wasted my life im not so good as you make me but i have tried to do right and now when its too late to begin even to do better its such a comfort to know that someone loves me so much and feels as if id helped them  more than any one in the world beth i used to think i couldnt let you go but im learning to feel that i dont lose you that youll be more to me than ever and death cant part us though it seems to  i know it cannot and i dont fear it any longer for im sure i shall be your beth still to love and help you more than ever you must take my place jo and be everything to father and mother when im gone they will turn to you dont fail them and if its hard to work alone remember that i dont forget you and that youll be happier in doing that than writing splendid books or seeing all the world for love is the only thing that we can carry with us when we go and it makes the end so easy  ill try beth and then and there jo renounced her old ambition pledged herself to a new and better one acknowledging the poverty of other desires and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the immortality of love  so the spring days came and went the sky grew clearer the earth greener the flowers were up fairly early and the birds came back in time to say goodbye to beth who like a tired but trustful child clung to the hands that had led her all her life as father and mother guided her tenderly through the valley of the shadow and gave her up to god  seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words see visions or depart with beatified countenances and those who have sped many parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and simply as sleep as beth had hoped the tide went out easily and in the dark hour before dawn on the bosom where she had drawn her first breath she quietly drew her last with no farewell but one loving look one little sigh  with tears and prayers and tender hands mother and sisters made her ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again seeing with grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic patience that had wrung their hearts so long and feeling with reverent joy that to their darling death was a benignant angel not a phantom full of dread  when morning came for the first time in many months the fire was out jos place was empty and the room was very still but a bird sang blithely on a budding bough close by the snowdrops blossomed freshly at the window and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction over the placid face upon the pillow a face so full of painless peace that those who loved it best smiled through their tears and thanked god that beth was well at last     chapter fortyone learning to forget   amys lecture did laurie good though of course he did not own it till long afterward men seldom do for when women are the advisers the lords of creation dont take the advice till they have persuaded themselves that it is just what they intended to do then they act upon it and if it succeeds they give the weaker vessel half the credit of it if it fails they generously give her the whole laurie went back to his grandfather and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of nice had improved him wonderfully and he had better try it again there was nothing the young gentleman would have liked better but elephants could not have dragged him back after the scolding he had received pride forbid and whenever the longing grew very strong he fortified his resolution by repeating the words that had made the deepest impressioni despise you go and do something splendid that will make her love you  laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought himself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy but then when a man has a great sorrow he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries till he has lived it down he felt that his blighted affections were quite dead now and though he should never cease to be a faithful mourner there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously jo wouldnt love him but he might make her respect and admire him by doing something which should prove that a girls no had not spoiled his life he had always meant to do something and amys advice was quite unnecessary he had only been waiting till the aforesaid blighted affections were decently interred that being done he felt that he was ready to hide his stricken heart and still toil on  as goethe when he had a joy or a grief put it into a song so laurie resolved to embalm his love sorrow in music and to compose a requiem which should harrow up jos soul and melt the heart of every hearer therefore the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody and ordered him off he went to vienna where he had musical friends and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish himself but whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music or music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe he soon discovered that the requiem was beyond him just at present it was evident that his mind was not in working order yet and his ideas needed clarifying for often in the middle of a plaintive strain he would find himself humming a dancing tune that vividly recalled the christmas ball at nice especially the stout frenchman and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the time being  then he tried an opera for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning but here again unforeseen difficulties beset him he wanted jo for his heroine and called upon his memory to supply him with tender recollections and romantic visions of his love but memory turned traitor and as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl would only recall jos oddities faults and freaks would only show her in the most unsentimental aspectsbeating mats with her head tied up in a bandanna barricading herself with the sofa pillow or throwing cold water over his passion a la gummidgeand an irresistable laugh spoiled the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint jo wouldnt be put into the opera at any price and he had to give her up with a bless that girl what a torment she is and a clutch at his hair as became a distracted composer  when he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to immortalize in melody memory produced one with the most obliging readiness this phantom wore many faces but it always had golden hair was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud and floated airily before his minds eye in a pleasing chaos of roses peacocks white ponies and blue ribbons he did not give the complacent wraith any name but he took her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her as well he might for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun and escorted her unscathed through trials which would have annihilated any mortal woman  thanks to this inspiration he got on swimmingly for a time but gradually the work lost its charm and he forgot to compose while he sat musing pen in hand or roamed about the gay city to get some new ideas and refresh his mind which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state that winter he did not do much but he thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself its genius simmering perhaps ill let it simmer and see what comes of it he said with a secret suspicion all the while that it wasnt genius but something far more common whatever it was it simmered to some purpose for he grew more and more discontented with his desultory life began to long for some real and earnest work to go at soul and body and finally came to the wise conclusion that everyone who loved music was not a composer returning from one of mozarts grand operas splendidly performed at the royal theatre he looked over his own played a few of the best parts sat staring at the busts of mendelssohn beethoven and bach who stared benignly back again then suddenly he tore up his music sheets one by one and as the last fluttered out of his hand he said soberly to himself  she is right talent isnt genius and you cant make it so that music has taken the vanity out of me as rome took it out of her and i wont be a humbug any longer now what shall i do  that seemed a hard question to answer and laurie began to wish he had to work for his daily bread now if ever occurred an eligible opportunity for going to the devil as he once forcibly expressed it for he had plenty of money and nothing to do and satan is proverbially fond of providing employment for full and idle hands the poor fellow had temptations enough from without and from within but he withstood them pretty well for much as he valued liberty he valued good faith and confidence more so his promise to his grandfather and his desire to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him and say alls well kept him safe and steady  very likely some mrs grundy will observe i dont believe it boys will be boys young men must sow their wild oats and women must not expect miracles i dare say you dont mrs grundy but its true nevertheless women work a good many miracles and i have a persuasion that they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by refusing to echo such sayings let the boys be boys the longer the better and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must but mothers sisters and friends may help to make the crop a small one and keep many tares from spoiling the harvest by believing and showing that they believe in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which make men manliest in good womens eyes if it is a feminine delusion leave us to enjoy it while we may for without it half the beauty and the romance of life is lost and sorrowful forebodings would embitter all our hopes of the brave tenderhearted little lads who still love their mothers better than themselves and are not ashamed to own it  laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for jo would absorb all his powers for years but to his great surprise he discovered it grew easier every day he refused to believe it at first got angry with himself and couldnt understand it but these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things and time and nature work their will in spite of us lauries heart wouldnt ache the wound persisted in healing with a rapidity that astonished him and instead of trying to forget he found himself trying to remember he had not foreseen this turn of affairs and was not prepared for it he was disgusted with himself surprised at his own fickleness and full of a queer mixture of disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a tremendous blow so soon he carefully stirred up the embers of his lost love but they refused to burst into a blaze there was only a comfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment very tender a little sad and resentful still but that was sure to pass away in time leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end  as the word brotherly passed through his mind in one of his reveries he smiled and glanced up at the picture of mozart that was before him  well he was a great man and when he couldnt have one sister he took the other and was happy  laurie did not utter the words but he thought them and the next instant kissed the little old ring saying to himself no i wont i havent forgotten i never can ill try again and if that fails why then  leaving his sentence unfinished he seized pen and paper and wrote to jo telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the least hope of her changing her mind couldnt she wouldnt sheand let him come home and be happy while waiting for an answer he did nothing but he did it energetically for he was in a fever of impatience it came at last and settled his mind effectually on one point for jo decidedly couldnt and wouldnt she was wrapped up in beth and never wished to hear the word love again then she begged him to be happy with somebody else but always keep a little corner of his heart for his loving sister jo in a postscript she desired him not to tell amy that beth was worse she was coming home in the spring and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay that would be time enough please god but laurie must write to her often and not let her feel lonely homesick or anxious  so i will at once poor little girl it will be a sad going home for her im afraid and laurie opened his desk as if writing to amy had been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks before  but he did not write the letter that day for as he rummaged out his best paper he came across something which changed his purpose tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills passports and business documents of various kinds were several of jos letters and in another compartment were three notes from amy carefully tied up with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away inside with a halfrepentant halfamused expression laurie gathered up all jos letters smoothed folded and put them neatly into a small drawer of the desk stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his finger then slowly drew it off laid it with the letters locked the drawer and went out to hear high mass at saint stefans feeling as if there had been a funeral and though not overwhelmed with affliction this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies  the letter went very soon however and was promptly answered for amy was homesick and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding manner the correspondence flourished famously and letters flew to and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring laurie sold his busts made allumettes of his opera and went back to paris hoping somebody would arrive before long he wanted desperately to go to nice but would not till he was asked and amy would not ask him for just then she was having little experiences of her own which made her rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of our boy  fred vaughn had returned and put the question to which she had once decided to answer yes thank you but now she said no thank you kindly but steadily for when the time came her courage failed her and she found that something more than money and position was needed to satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes and fears the words fred is a good fellow but not at all the man i fancied you would ever like and lauries face when he uttered them kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in look if not in words i shall marry for money it troubled her to remember that now she wished she could take it back it sounded so unwomanly she didnt want laurie to think her a heartless worldly creature she didnt care to be a queen of society now half so much as she did to be a lovable woman she was so glad he didnt hate her for the dreadful things she said but took them so beautifully and was kinder than ever his letters were such a comfort for the home letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when they did come it was not only a pleasure but a duty to answer them for the poor fellow was forlorn and needed petting since jo persisted in being stonyhearted she ought to have made an effort and tried to love him it couldnt be very hard many people would be proud and glad to have such a dear boy care for them but jo never would act like other girls so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat him like a brother  if all brothers were treated as well as laurie was at this period they would be a much happier race of beings than they are amy never lectured now she asked his opinion on all subjects she was interested in everything he did made charming little presents for him and sent him two letters a week full of lively gossip sisterly confidences and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her as few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about in their sisters pockets read and reread diligently cried over when short kissed when long and treasured carefully we will not hint that amy did any of these fond and foolish things but she certainly did grow a little pale and pensive that spring lost much of her relish for society and went out sketching alone a good deal she never had much to show when she came home but was studying nature i dare say while she sat for hours with her hands folded on the terrace at valrosa or absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her a stalwart knight carved on a tomb a young man asleep in the grass with his hat over his eyes or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array promenading down a ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman both faces being left a blur according to the last fashion in art which was safe but not altogether satisfactory  her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to fred and finding denials useless and explanations impossible amy left her to think what she liked taking care that laurie should know that fred had gone to egypt that was all but he understood it and looked relieved as he said to himself with a venerable air  i was sure she would think better of it poor old fellow ive been through it all and i can sympathize  with that he heaved a great sigh and then as if he had discharged his duty to the past put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed amys letter luxuriously  while these changes were going on abroad trouble had come at home but the letter telling that beth was failing never reached amy and when the next found her the grass was green above her sister the sad news met her at vevay for the heat had driven them from nice in may and they had travelled slowly to switzerland by way of genoa and the italian lakes she bore it very well and quietly submitted to the family decree that she should not shorten her visit for since it was too late to say goodbye to beth she had better stay and let absence soften her sorrow but her heart was very heavy she longed to be at home and every day looked wistfully across the lake waiting for laurie to come and comfort her  he did come very soon for the same mail brought letters to them both but he was in germany and it took some days to reach him the moment he read it he packed his knapsack bade adieu to his fellow pedestrians and was off to keep his promise with a heart full of joy and sorrow hope and suspense  he knew vevay well and as soon as the boat touched the little quay he hurried along the shore to la tour where the carrols were living en pension the garcon was in despair that the whole family had gone to take a promenade on the lake but no the blonde mademoiselle might be in the chateau garden if monsieur would give himself the pain of sitting down a flash of time should present her but monsieur could not wait even a flash of time and in the middle of the speech departed to find mademoiselle himself  a pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake with chestnuts rustling overhead ivy climbing everywhere and the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny water at one corner of the wide low wall was a seat and here amy often came to read or work or console herself with the beauty all about her she was sitting here that day leaning her head on her hand with a homesick heart and heavy eyes thinking of beth and wondering why laurie did not come she did not hear him cross the courtyard beyond nor see him pause in the archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden he stood a minute looking at her with new eyes seeing what no one had ever seen before the tender side of amys character everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow the blotted letters in her lap the black ribbon that tied up her hair the womanly pain and patience in her face even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to laurie for he had given it to her and she wore it as her only ornament if he had any doubts about the reception she would give him they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him for dropping everything she ran to him exclaiming in a tone of unmistakable love and longing  oh laurie laurie i knew youd come to me  i think everything was said and settled then for as they stood together quite silent for a moment with the dark head bent down protectingly over the light one amy felt that no one could comfort and sustain her so well as laurie and laurie decided that amy was the only woman in the world who could fill jos place and make him happy he did not tell her so but she was not disappointed for both felt the truth were satisfied and gladly left the rest to silence  in a minute amy went back to her place and while she dried her tears laurie gathered up the scattered papers finding in the sight of sundry wellworn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future as he sat down beside her amy felt shy again and turned rosy red at the recollection of her impulsive greeting  i couldnt help it i felt so lonely and sad and was so very glad to see you it was such a surprise to look up and find you just as i was beginning to fear you wouldnt come she said trying in vain to speak quite naturally  i came the minute i heard i wish i could say something to comfort you for the loss of dear little beth but i can only feel and he could not get any further for he too turned bashful all of a sudden and did not quite know what to say he longed to lay amys head down on his shoulder and tell her to have a good cry but he did not dare so took her hand instead and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than words  you neednt say anything this comforts me she said softly beth is well and happy and i mustnt wish her back but i dread the going home much as i long to see them all we wont talk about it now for it makes me cry and i want to enjoy you while you stay you neednt go right back need you  not if you want me dear  i do so much aunt and flo are very kind but you seem like one of the family and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little while  amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once and gave her just what she wantedthe petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she needed  poor little soul you look as if youd grieved yourself half sick im going to take care of you so dont cry any more but come and walk about with me the wind is too chilly for you to sit still he said in the halfcaressing halfcommanding way that amy liked as he tied on her hat drew her arm through his and began to pace up and down the sunny walk under the newleaved chestnuts he felt more at ease upon his legs and amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon a familiar face to smile at her and a kind voice to talk delightfully for her alone  the quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers and seemed expressly made for them so sunny and secluded was it with nothing but the tower to overlook them and the wide lake to carry away the echo of their words as it rippled by below for an hour this new pair walked and talked or rested on the wall enjoying the sweet influences which gave such a charm to time and place and when an unromantic dinner bell warned them away amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and sorrow behind her in the chateau garden  the moment mrs carrol saw the girls altered face she was illuminated with a new idea and exclaimed to herself now i understand it allthe child has been pining for young laurence bless my heart i never thought of such a thing  with praiseworthy discretion the good lady said nothing and betrayed no sign of enlightenment but cordially urged laurie to stay and begged amy to enjoy his society for it would do her more good than so much solitude amy was a model of docility and as her aunt was a good deal occupied with flo she was left to entertain her friend and did it with more than her usual success  at nice laurie had lounged and amy had scolded at vevay laurie was never idle but always walking riding boating or studying in the most energetic manner while amy admired everything he did and followed his example as far and as fast as she could he said the change was owing to the climate and she did not contradict him being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits  the invigorating air did them both good and much exercise worked wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies they seemed to get clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills the fresh winds blew away desponding doubts delusive fancies and moody mists the warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas tender hopes and happy thoughts the lake seemed to wash away the troubles of the past and the grand old mountains to look benignly down upon them saying little children love one another  in spite of the new sorrow it was a very happy time so happy that laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word it took him a little while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first and as he had firmly believed his last and only love he consoled himself for the seeming disloyalty by the thought that jos sister was almost the same as jos self and the conviction that it would have been impossible to love any other woman but amy so soon and so well his first wooing had been of the tempestuous order and he looked back upon it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion blended with regret he was not ashamed of it but put it away as one of the bittersweet experiences of his life for which he could be grateful when the pain was over his second wooing he resolved should be as calm and simple as possible there was no need of having a scene hardly any need of telling amy that he loved her she knew it without words and had given him his answer long ago it all came about so naturally that no one could complain and he knew that everybody would be pleased even jo but when our first little passion has been crushed we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial so laurie let the days pass enjoying every hour and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance  he had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in the chateau garden by moonlight and in the most graceful and decorous manner but it turned out exactly the reverse for the matter was settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words they had been floating about all the morning from gloomy st gingolf to sunny montreux with the alps of savoy on one side mont st bernard and the dent du midi on the other pretty vevay in the valley and lausanne upon the hill beyond a cloudless blue sky overhead and the bluer lake below dotted with the picturesque boats that look like whitewinged gulls  they had been talking of bonnivard as they glided past chillon and of rousseau as they looked up at clarens where he wrote his heloise neither had read it but they knew it was a love story and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own amy had been dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell between them and when she looked up laurie was leaning on his oars with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily merely for the sake of saying something  you must be tired rest a little and let me row it will do me good for since you came i have been altogether lazy and luxurious  im not tired but you may take an oar if you like theres room enough though i have to sit nearly in the middle else the boat wont trim returned laurie as if he rather liked the arrangement  feeling that she had not mended matters much amy took the offered third of a seat shook her hair over her face and accepted an oar she rowed as well as she did many other things and though she used both hands and laurie but one the oars kept time and the boat went smoothly through the water  how well we pull together dont we said amy who objected to silence just then  so well that i wish we might always pull in the same boat will you amy very tenderly  yes laurie very low  then they both stopped rowing and unconsciously added a pretty little tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected in the lake     chapter fortytwo all alone   it was easy to promise selfabnegation when self was wrapped up in another and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example but when the helpful voice was silent the daily lesson over the beloved presence gone and nothing remained but loneliness and grief then jo found her promise very hard to keep how could she comfort father and mother when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her sister how could she make the house cheerful when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when beth left the old home for the new and where in all the world could she find some useful happy work to do that would take the place of the loving service which had been its own reward she tried in a blind hopeless way to do her duty secretly rebelling against it all the while for it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened her burdens made heavier and life get harder and harder as she toiled along some people seemed to get all sunshine and some all shadow it was not fair for she tried more than amy to be good but never got any reward only disappointment trouble and hard work  poor jo these were dark days to her for something like despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house devoted to humdrum cares a few small pleasures and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier i cant do it i wasnt meant for a life like this and i know i shall break away and do something desperate if somebody doesnt come and help me she said to herself when her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody miserable state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable  but someone did come and help her though jo did not recognize her good angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity often she started up at night thinking beth called her and when the sight of the little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive sorrow oh beth come back come back she did not stretch out her yearning arms in vain for as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her sisters faintest whisper her mother came to comfort her not with words only but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch tears that were mute reminders of a greater grief than jos and broken whispers more eloquent than prayers because hopeful resignation went handinhand with natural sorrow sacred moments when heart talked to heart in the silence of the night turning affliction to a blessing which chastened grief and strengthened love feeling this jos burden seemed easier to bear duty grew sweeter and life looked more endurable seen from the safe shelter of her mothers arms  when aching heart was a little comforted troubled mind likewise found help for one day she went to the study and leaning over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile she said very humbly father talk to me as you did to beth i need it more than she did for im all wrong  my dear nothing can comfort me like this he answered with a falter in his voice and both arms round her as if he too needed help and did not fear to ask for it  then sitting in beths little chair close beside him jo told her troubles the resentful sorrow for her loss the fruitless efforts that discouraged her the want of faith that made life look so dark and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair she gave him entire confidence he gave her the help she needed and both found consolation in the act for the time had come when they could talk together not only as father and daughter but as man and woman able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love happy thoughtful times there in the old study which jo called the church of one member and from which she came with fresh courage recovered cheerfulness and a more submissive spirit for the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear were trying now to teach another to accept life without despondency or distrust and to use its beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power  other helps had johumble wholesome duties and delights that would not be denied their part in serving her and which she slowly learned to see and value brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as they once had been for beth had presided over both and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the little mop and the old brush never thrown away as she used them jo found herself humming the songs beth used to hum imitating beths orderly ways and giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and cozy which was the first step toward making home happy though she didnt know it till hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand  you thoughtful creeter youre determined we shant miss that dear lamb ef you can help it we dont say much but we see it and the lord will bless you fort see ef he dont  as they sat sewing together jo discovered how much improved her sister meg was how well she could talk how much she knew about good womanly impulses thoughts and feelings how happy she was in husband and children and how much they were all doing for each other  marriage is an excellent thing after all i wonder if i should blossom out half as well as you have if i tried it always perwisin i could said jo as she constructed a kite for demi in the topsyturvy nursery  its just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of your nature jo you are like a chestnut burr prickly outside but silkysoft within and a sweet kernal if one can only get at it love will make you show your heart one day and then the rough burr will fall off  frost opens chestnut burrs maam and it takes a good shake to bring them down boys go nutting and i dont care to be bagged by them returned jo pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would ever carry up for daisy had tied herself on as a bob  meg laughed for she was glad to see a glimmer of jos old spirit but she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her power and the sisterly chats were not wasted especially as two of megs most effective arguments were the babies whom jo loved tenderly grief is the best opener of some hearts and jos was nearly ready for the bag a little more sunshine to ripen the nut then not a boys impatient shake but a mans hand reached up to pick it gently from the burr and find the kernal sound and sweet if she suspected this she would have shut up tight and been more prickly than ever fortunately she wasnt thinking about herself so when the time came down she dropped  now if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook she ought at this period of her life to have become quite saintly renounced the world and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet with tracts in her pocket but you see jo wasnt a heroine she was only a struggling human girl like hundreds of others and she just acted out her nature being sad cross listless or energetic as the mood suggested its highly virtuous to say well be good but we cant do it all at once and it takes a long pull a strong pull and a pull all together before some of us even get our feet set in the right way jo had got so far she was learning to do her duty and to feel unhappy if she did not but to do it cheerfully ah that was another thing she had often said she wanted to do something splendid no matter how hard and now she had her wish for what could be more beautiful than to devote her life to father and mother trying to make home as happy to them as they had to her and if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor of the effort what could be harder for a restless ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes plans and desires and cheerfully live for others  providence had taken her at her word here was the task not what she had expected but better because self had no part in it now could she do it she decided that she would try and in her first attempt she found the helps i have suggested still another was given her and she took it not as a reward but as a comfort as christian took the refreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested as he climbed the hill called difficulty  why dont you write that always used to make you happy said her mother once when the desponding fit overshadowed jo  ive no heart to write and if i had nobody cares for my things  we do write something for us and never mind the rest of the world try it dear im sure it would do you good and please us very much  dont believe i can but jo got out her desk and began to overhaul her halffinished manuscripts  an hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was scratching away with her black pinafore on and an absorbed expression which caused mrs march to smile and slip away well pleased with the success of her suggestion jo never knew how it happened but something got into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it for when her family had laughed and cried over it her father sent it much against her will to one of the popular magazines and to her utter surprise it was not only paid for but others requested letters from several persons whose praise was honor followed the appearance of the little story newspapers copied it and strangers as well as friends admired it for a small thing it was a great success and jo was more astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all at once  i dont understand it what can there be in a simple little story like that to make people praise it so she said quite bewildered  there is truth in it jo thats the secret humor and pathos make it alive and you have found your style at last you wrote with no thoughts of fame and money and put your heart into it my daughter you have had the bitter now comes the sweet do your best and grow as happy as we are in your success  if there is anything good or true in what i write it isnt mine i owe it all to you and mother and beth said jo more touched by her fathers words than by any amount of praise from the world  so taught by love and sorrow jo wrote her little stories and sent them away to make friends for themselves and her finding it a very charitable world to such humble wanderers for they were kindly welcomed and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes  when amy and laurie wrote of their engagement mrs march feared that jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it but her fears were soon set at rest for though jo looked grave at first she took it very quietly and was full of hopes and plans for the children before she read the letter twice it was a sort of written duet wherein each glorified the other in loverlike fashion very pleasant to read and satisfactory to think of for no one had any objection to make  you like it mother said jo as they laid down the closely written sheets and looked at one another  yes i hoped it would be so ever since amy wrote that she had refused fred i felt sure then that something better than what you call the mercenary spirit had come over her and a hint here and there in her letters made me suspect that love and laurie would win the day  how sharp you are marmee and how silent you never said a word to me  mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have girls to manage i was half afraid to put the idea into your head lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled  im not the scatterbrain i was you may trust me im sober and sensible enough for anyones confidante now  so you are my dear and i should have made you mine only i fancied it might pain you to learn that your teddy loved someone else  now mother did you really think i could be so silly and selfish after id refused his love when it was freshest if not best  i knew you were sincere then jo but lately i have thought that if he came back and asked again you might perhaps feel like giving another answer forgive me dear i cant help seeing that you are very lonely and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart so i fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now  no mother it is better as it is and im glad amy has learned to love him but you are right in one thing i am lonely and perhaps if teddy had tried again i might have said yes not because i love him any more but because i care more to be loved than when he went away  im glad of that jo for it shows that you are getting on there are plenty to love you so try to be satisfied with father and mother sisters and brothers friends and babies till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward  mothers are the best lovers in the world but i dont mind whispering to marmee that id like to try all kinds its very curious but the more i try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections the more i seem to want id no idea hearts could take in so many mine is so elastic it never seems full now and i used to be quite contented with my family i dont understand it  i do and mrs march smiled her wise smile as jo turned back the leaves to read what amy said of laurie  it is so beautiful to be loved as laurie loves me he isnt sentimental doesnt say much about it but i see and feel it in all he says and does and it makes me so happy and so humble that i dont seem to be the same girl i was i never knew how good and generous and tender he was till now for he lets me read his heart and i find it full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes and am so proud to know its mine he says he feels as if he could make a prosperous voyage now with me aboard as mate and lots of love for ballast i pray he may and try to be all he believes me for i love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and might and never will desert him while god lets us be together oh mother i never knew how much like heaven this world could be when two people love and live for one another  and thats our cool reserved and worldly amy truly love does work miracles how very very happy they must be and jo laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand as one might shut the covers of a lovely romance which holds the reader fast till the end comes and he finds himself alone in the workaday world again  byandby jo roamed away upstairs for it was rainy and she could not walk a restless spirit possessed her and the old feeling came again not bitter as it once was but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one sister should have all she asked the other nothing it was not true she knew that and tried to put it away but the natural craving for affection was strong and amys happiness woke the hungry longing for someone to love with heart and soul and cling to while god let them be together up in the garret where jos unquiet wanderings ended stood four little wooden chests in a row each marked with its owners name and each filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended now for all jo glanced into them and when she came to her own leaned her chin on the edge and stared absently at the chaotic collection till a bundle of old exercise books caught her eye she drew them out turned them over and relived that pleasant winter at kind mrs kirkes she had smiled at first then she looked thoughtful next sad and when she came to a little message written in the professors hand her lips began to tremble the books slid out of her lap and she sat looking at the friendly words as they took a new meaning and touched a tender spot in her heart  wait for me my friend i may be a little late but i shall surely come  oh if he only would so kind so good so patient with me always my dear old fritz i didnt value him half enough when i had him but now how i should love to see him for everyone seems going away from me and im all alone  and holding the little paper fast as if it were a promise yet to be fulfilled jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag bag and cried as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof  was it all selfpity loneliness or low spirits or was it the waking up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its inspirer who shall say     chapter fortythree surprises   jo was alone in the twilight lying on the old sofa looking at the fire and thinking it was her favorite way of spending the hour of dusk no one disturbed her and she used to lie there on beths little red pillow planning stories dreaming dreams or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away her face looked tired grave and rather sad for tomorrow was her birthday and she was thinking how fast the years went by how old she was getting and how little she seemed to have accomplished almost twentyfive and nothing to show for it jo was mistaken in that there was a good deal to show and byandby she saw and was grateful for it  an old maid thats what im to be a literary spinster with a pen for a spouse a family of stories for children and twenty years hence a morsel of fame perhaps when like poor johnson im old and cant enjoy it solitary and cant share it independent and dont need it well i neednt be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner and i dare say old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it but and there jo sighed as if the prospect was not inviting  it seldom is at first and thirty seems the end of all things to fiveandtwenty but its not as bad as it looks and one can get on quite happily if one has something in ones self to fall back upon at twentyfive girls begin to talk about being old maids but secretly resolve that they never will be at thirty they say nothing about it but quietly accept the fact and if sensible console themselves by remembering that they have twenty more useful happy years in which they may be learning to grow old gracefully dont laugh at the spinsters dear girls for often very tender tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns and many silent sacrifices of youth health ambition love itself make the faded faces beautiful in gods sight even the sad sour sisters should be kindly dealt with because they have missed the sweetest part of life if for no other reason and looking at them with compassion not contempt girls in their bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time that rosy cheeks dont last forever that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair and that byandby kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now  gentlemen which means boys be courteous to the old maids no matter how poor and plain and prim for the only chivalry worth having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to the old protect the feeble and serve womankind regardless of rank age or color just recollect the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed but nursed and petted too often without thanks the scrapes they have helped you out of the tips they have given you from their small store the stitches the patient old fingers have set for you the steps the willing old feet have taken and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to receive as long as they live the brighteyed girls are quick to see such traits and will like you all the better for them and if death almost the only power that can part mother and son should rob you of yours you will be sure to find a tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some aunt priscilla who has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for the best nevvy in the world  jo must have fallen asleep as i dare say my reader has during this little homily for suddenly lauries ghost seemed to stand before her a substantial lifelike ghost leaning over her with the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didnt like to show it but like jenny in the ballad  she could not think it he  and lay staring up at him in startled silence till he stooped and kissed her then she knew him and flew up crying joyfully  oh my teddy oh my teddy  dear jo you are glad to see me then  glad my blessed boy words cant express my gladness wheres amy  your mother has got her down at megs we stopped there by the way and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches  your what cried jo for laurie uttered those two words with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him  oh the dickens now ive done it and he looked so guilty that jo was down on him like a flash  youve gone and got married  yes please but i never will again and he went down upon his knees with a penitent clasping of hands and a face full of mischief mirth and triumph  actually married  very much so thank you  mercy on us what dreadful thing will you do next and jo fell into her seat with a gasp  a characteristic but not exactly complimentary congratulation returned laurie still in an abject attitude but beaming with satisfaction  what can you expect when you take ones breath away creeping in like a burglar and letting cats out of bags like that get up you ridiculous boy and tell me all about it  not a word unless you let me come in my old place and promise not to barricade  jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day and patted the sofa invitingly as she said in a cordial tone the old pillow is up garret and we dont need it now so come and fess teddy  how good it sounds to hear you say teddy no one ever calls me that but you and laurie sat down with an air of great content  what does amy call you  my lord  thats like her well you look it and jos eye plainly betrayed that she found her boy comelier than ever  the pillow was gone but there was a barricade nevertheless a natural one raised by time absence and change of heart both felt it and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a little shadow over them it was gone directly however for laurie said with a vain attempt at dignity  dont i look like a married man and the head of a family  not a bit and you never will youve grown bigger and bonnier but you are the same scapegrace as ever  now really jo you ought to treat me with more respect began laurie who enjoyed it all immensely  how can i when the mere idea of you married and settled is so irresistibly funny that i cant keep sober answered jo smiling all over her face so infectiously that they had another laugh and then settled down for a good talk quite in the pleasant old fashion  its no use your going out in the cold to get amy for they are all coming up presently i couldnt wait i wanted to be the one to tell you the grand surprise and have first skim as we used to say when we squabbled about the cream  of course you did and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong end now start right and tell me how it all happened im pining to know  well i did it to please amy began laurie with a twinkle that made jo exclaim  fib number one amy did it to please you go on and tell the truth if you can sir  now shes beginning to marm it isnt it jolly to hear her said laurie to the fire and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite agreed its all the same you know she and i being one we planned to come home with the carrols a month or more ago but they suddenly changed their minds and decided to pass another winter in paris but grandpa wanted to come home he went to please me and i couldnt let him go alone neither could i leave amy and mrs carrol had got english notions about chaperons and such nonsense and wouldnt let amy come with us so i just settled the difficulty by saying lets be married and then we can do as we like  of course you did you always have things to suit you  not always and something in lauries voice made jo say hastily  how did you ever get aunt to agree  it was hard work but between us we talked her over for we had heaps of good reasons on our side there wasnt time to write and ask leave but you all liked it had consented to it byandby and it was only taking time by the fetlock as my wife says  arent we proud of those two words and dont we like to say them interrupted jo addressing the fire in her turn and watching with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last  a trifle perhaps shes such a captivating little woman i cant help being proud of her well then uncle and aunt were there to play propriety we were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use apart and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all round so we did it  when where how asked jo in a fever of feminine interest and curiosity for she could not realize it a particle  six weeks ago at the american consuls in paris a very quiet wedding of course for even in our happiness we didnt forget dear little beth  jo put her hand in his as he said that and laurie gently smoothed the little red pillow which he remembered well  why didnt you let us know afterward asked jo in a quieter tone when they had sat quite still a minute  we wanted to surprise you we thought we were coming directly home at first but the dear old gentleman as soon as we were married found he couldnt be ready under a month at least and sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked amy had once called valrosa a regular honeymoon home so we went there and were as happy as people are but once in their lives my faith wasnt it love among the roses  laurie seemed to forget jo for a minute and jo was glad of it for the fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten she tried to draw away her hand but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the halfinvoluntary impulse laurie held it fast and said with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before  jo dear i want to say one thing and then well put it by forever as i told you in my letter when i wrote that amy had been so kind to me i never shall stop loving you but the love is altered and i have learned to see that it is better as it is amy and you changed places in my heart thats all i think it was meant to be so and would have come about naturally if i had waited as you tried to make me but i never could be patient and so i got a heartache i was a boy then headstrong and violent and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake for it was one jo as you said and i found it out after making a fool of myself upon my word i was so tumbled up in my mind at one time that i didnt know which i loved best you or amy and tried to love you both alike but i couldnt and when i saw her in switzerland everything seemed to clear up all at once you both got into your right places and i felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with the new that i could honestly share my heart between sister jo and wife amy and love them dearly will you believe it and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one another  ill believe it with all my heart but teddy we never can be boy and girl again the happy old times cant come back and we mustnt expect it we are man and woman now with sober work to do for playtime is over and we must give up frolicking im sure you feel this i see the change in you and youll find it in me i shall miss my boy but i shall love the man as much and admire him more because he means to be what i hoped he would we cant be little playmates any longer but we will be brother and sister to love and help one another all our lives wont we laurie  he did not say a word but took the hand she offered him and laid his face down on it for a minute feeling that out of the grave of a boyish passion there had risen a beautiful strong friendship to bless them both presently jo said cheerfully for she didnt want the coming home to be a sad one i cant make it true that you children are really married and going to set up housekeeping why it seems only yesterday that i was buttoning amys pinafore and pulling your hair when you teased mercy me how time does fly  as one of the children is older than yourself you neednt talk so like a grandma i flatter myself im a gentleman growed as peggotty said of david and when you see amy youll find her rather a precocious infant said laurie looking amused at her maternal air  you may be a little older in years but im ever so much older in feeling teddy women always are and this last year has been such a hard one that i feel forty  poor jo we left you to bear it alone while we went pleasuring you are older heres a line and theres another unless you smile your eyes look sad and when i touched the cushion just now i found a tear on it youve had a great deal to bear and had to bear it all alone what a selfish beast ive been and laurie pulled his own hair with a remorseful look  but jo only turned over the traitorous pillow and answered in a tone which she tried to make more cheerful no i had father and mother to help me and the dear babies to comfort me and the thought that you and amy were safe and happy to make the troubles here easier to bear i am lonely sometimes but i dare say its good for me and  you never shall be again broke in laurie putting his arm about her as if to fence out every human ill amy and i cant get on without you so you must come and teach the children to keep house and go halves in everything just as we used to do and let us pet you and all be blissfully happy and friendly together  if i shouldnt be in the way it would be very pleasant i begin to feel quite young already for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly away when you came you always were a comfort teddy and jo leaned her head on his shoulder just as she did years ago when beth lay ill and laurie told her to hold on to him  he looked down at her wondering if she remembered the time but jo was smiling to herself as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his coming  you are the same jo still dropping tears about one minute and laughing the next you look a little wicked now what is it grandma  i was wondering how you and amy get on together  like angels  yes of course but which rules  i dont mind telling you that she does now at least i let her think so it pleases her you know byandby we shall take turns for marriage they say halves ones rights and doubles ones duties  youll go on as you begin and amy will rule you all the days of your life  well she does it so imperceptibly that i dont think i shall mind much she is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well in fact i rather like it for she winds one round her finger as softly and prettily as a skein of silk and makes you feel as if she was doing you a favor all the while  that ever i should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying it cried jo with uplifted hands  it was good to see laurie square his shoulders and smile with masculine scorn at that insinuation as he replied with his high and mighty air amy is too wellbred for that and i am not the sort of man to submit to it my wife and i respect ourselves and one another too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel  jo liked that and thought the new dignity very becoming but the boy seemed changing very fast into the man and regret mingled with her pleasure  i am sure of that amy and you never did quarrel as we used to she is the sun and i the wind in the fable and the sun managed the man best you remember  she can blow him up as well as shine on him laughed laurie such a lecture as i got at nice i give you my word it was a deal worse than any of your scoldings a regular rouser ill tell you all about it sometime she never will because after telling me that she despised and was ashamed of me she lost her heart to the despicable party and married the goodfornothing  what baseness well if she abuses you come to me and ill defend you  i look as if i needed it dont i said laurie getting up and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the rapturous as amys voice was heard calling where is she wheres my dear old jo  in trooped the whole family and everyone was hugged and kissed all over again and after several vain attempts the three wanderers were set down to be looked at and exulted over mr laurence hale and hearty as ever was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone and the oldfashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier than ever it was good to see him beam at my children as he called the young pair it was better still to see amy pay him the daughterly duty and affection which completely won his old heart and best of all to watch laurie revolve about the two as if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made  the minute she put her eyes upon amy meg became conscious that her own dress hadnt a parisian air that young mrs moffat would be entirely eclipsed by young mrs laurence and that her ladyship was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman jo thought as she watched the pair how well they look together i was right and laurie has found the beautiful accomplished girl who will become his home better than clumsy old jo and be a pride not a torment to him mrs march and her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces for they saw that their youngest had done well not only in worldly things but the better wealth of love confidence and happiness  for amys face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a peaceful heart her voice had a new tenderness in it and the cool prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity both womanly and winning no little affectations marred it and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace for it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to become  love has done much for our little girl said her mother softly  she has had a good example before her all her life my dear mr march whispered back with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside him  daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her pitty aunty but attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of delightful charms demi paused to consider the new relationship before he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe which took the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from berne a flank movement produced an unconditional surrender however for laurie knew where to have him  young man when i first had the honor of making your acquaintance you hit me in the face now i demand the satisfaction of a gentleman and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted his boyish soul  blest if she aint in silk from head to foot aint it a relishin sight to see her settin there as fine as a fiddle and hear folks calling little amy mis laurence muttered old hannah who could not resist frequent peeks through the slide as she set the table in a most decidedly promiscuous manner  mercy on us how they did talk first one then the other then all burst out togethertrying to tell the history of three years in half an hour it was fortunate that tea was at hand to produce a lull and provide refreshmentfor they would have been hoarse and faint if they had gone on much longer such a happy procession as filed away into the little dining room mr march proudly escorted mrs laurence mrs march as proudly leaned on the arm of my son the old gentleman took jo with a whispered you must be my girl now and a glance at the empty corner by the fire that made jo whisper back ill try to fill her place sir  the twins pranced behind feeling that the millennium was at hand for everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at their own sweet will and you may be sure they made the most of the opportunity didnt they steal sips of tea stuff gingerbread ad libitum get a hot biscuit apiece and as a crowning trespass didnt they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets there to stick and crumble treacherously teaching them that both human nature and a pastry are frail burdened with the guilty consciousness of the sequestered tarts and fearing that dodos sharp eyes would pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty the little sinners attached themselves to dranpa who hadnt his spectacles on amy who was handed about like refreshments returned to the parlor on father laurences arm the others paired off as before and this arrangement left jo companionless she did not mind it at the minute for she lingered to answer hannahs eager inquiry  will miss amy ride in her coop coupe and use all them lovely silver dishes thats stored away over yander  shouldnt wonder if she drove six white horses ate off gold plate and wore diamonds and point lace every day teddy thinks nothing too good for her returned jo with infinite satisfaction  no more there is will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast asked hannah who wisely mingled poetry and prose  i dont care and jo shut the door feeling that food was an uncongenial topic just then she stood a minute looking at the party vanishing above and as demis short plaid legs toiled up the last stair a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she looked about her with dim eyes as if to find something to lean upon for even teddy had deserted her if she had known what birthday gift was coming every minute nearer and nearer she would not have said to herself ill weep a little weep when i go to bed it wont do to be dismal now then she drew her hand over her eyes for one of her boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was and had just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch door  she opened with hospitable haste and started as if another ghost had come to surprise her for there stood a tall bearded gentleman beaming on her from the darkness like a midnight sun  oh mr bhaer i am so glad to see you cried jo with a clutch as if she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him in  and i to see miss marsch but no you haf a party and the professor paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to them  no we havent only the family my sister and friends have just come home and we are all very happy come in and make one of us  though a very social man i think mr bhaer would have gone decorously away and come again another day but how could he when jo shut the door behind him and bereft him of his hat perhaps her face had something to do with it for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary man whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes  if i shall not be monsieur de trop i will so gladly see them all you haf been ill my friend  he put the question abruptly for as jo hung up his coat the light fell on her face and he saw a change in it  not ill but tired and sorrowful we have had trouble since i saw you last  ah yes i know my heart was sore for you when i heard that and he shook hands again with such a sympathetic face that jo felt as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes the grasp of the big warm hand  father mother this is my friend professor bhaer she said with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish  if the stranger had any doubts about his reception they were set at rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received everyone greeted him kindly for jos sake at first but very soon they liked him for his own they could not help it for he carried the talisman that opens all hearts and these simple people warmed to him at once feeling even the more friendly because he was poor for poverty enriches those who live above it and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits mr bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a traveler who knocks at a strange door and when it opens finds himself at home the children went to him like bees to a honeypot and establishing themselves on each knee proceeded to captivate him by rifling his pockets pulling his beard and investigating his watch with juvenile audacity the women telegraphed their approval to one another and mr march feeling that he had got a kindred spirit opened his choicest stores for his guests benefit while silent john listened and enjoyed the talk but said not a word and mr laurence found it impossible to go to sleep  if jo had not been otherwise engaged lauries behavior would have amused her for a faint twinge not of jealousy but something like suspicion caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first and observe the newcomer with brotherly circumspection but it did not last long he got interested in spite of himself and before he knew it was drawn into the circle for mr bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere and did himself justice he seldom spoke to laurie but he looked at him often and a shadow would pass across his face as if regretting his own lost youth as he watched the young man in his prime then his eyes would turn to jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had seen it but jo had her own eyes to take care of and feeling that they could not be trusted she prudently kept them on the little sock she was knitting like a model maiden aunt  a stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water after a dusty walk for the sidelong peeps showed her several propitious omens mr bhaers face had lost the absentminded expression and looked all alive with interest in the present moment actually young and handsome she thought forgetting to compare him with laurie as she usually did strange men to their great detriment then he seemed quite inspired though the burial customs of the ancients to which the conversation had strayed might not be considered an exhilarating topic jo quite glowed with triumph when teddy got quenched in an argument and thought to herself as she watched her fathers absorbed face how he would enjoy having such a man as my professor to talk with every day lastly mr bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black which made him look more like a gentleman than ever his bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed but didnt stay in order long for in exciting moments he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do and jo liked it rampantly erect better than flat because she thought it gave his fine forehead a jovelike aspect poor jo how she did glorify that plain man as she sat knitting away so quietly yet letting nothing escape her not even the fact that mr bhaer actually had gold sleevebuttons in his immaculate wristbands  dear old fellow he couldnt have got himself up with more care if hed been going awooing said jo to herself and then a sudden thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her ball and go down after it to hide her face  the maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected however for though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre the professor dropped his torch metaphorically speaking and made a dive after the little blue ball of course they bumped their heads smartly together saw stars and both came up flushed and laughing without the ball to resume their seats wishing they had not left them  nobody knew where the evening went to for hannah skillfully abstracted the babies at an early hour nodding like two rosy poppies and mr laurence went home to rest the others sat round the fire talking away utterly regardless of the lapse of time till meg whose maternal mind was impressed with a firm conviction that daisy had tumbled out of bed and demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of matches made a move to go  we must have our sing in the good old way for we are all together again once more said jo feeling that a good shout would be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul  they were not all there but no one found the words thoughtless or untrue for beth still seemed among them a peaceful presence invisible but dearer than ever since death could not break the household league that love made dissoluble the little chair stood in its old place the tidy basket with the bit of work she left unfinished when the needle grew so heavy was still on its accustomed shelf the beloved instrument seldom touched now had not been moved and above it beths face serene and smiling as in the early days looked down upon them seeming to say be happy i am here  play something amy let them hear how much you have improved said laurie with pardonable pride in his promising pupil  but amy whispered with full eyes as she twirled the faded stool not tonight dear i cant show off tonight  but she did show something better than brilliancy or skill for she sang beths songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master could not have taught and touched the listeners hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her the room was very still when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of beths favorite hymn it was hard to say  earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal   and amy leaned against her husband who stood behind her feeling that her welcome home was not quite perfect without beths kiss  now we must finish with mignons song for mr bhaer sings that said jo before the pause grew painful and mr bhaer cleared his throat with a gratified hem as he stepped into the corner where jo stood saying  you will sing with me we go excellently well together  a pleasing fiction by the way for jo had no more idea of music than a grasshopper but she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a whole opera and warbled away blissfully regardless of time and tune it didnt much matter for mr bhaer sang like a true german heartily and well and jo soon subsided into a subdued hum that she might listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone  knowst thou the land where the citron blooms   used to be the professors favorite line for das land meant germany to him but now he seemed to dwell with peculiar warmth and melody upon the words  there oh there might i with thee o my beloved go   and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she longed to say she did know the land and would joyfully depart thither whenever he liked  the song was considered a great success and the singer retired covered with laurels but a few minutes afterward he forgot his manners entirely and stared at amy putting on her bonnet for she had been introduced simply as my sister and no one had called her by her new name since he came he forgot himself still further when laurie said in his most gracious manner at parting  my wife and i are very glad to meet you sir please remember that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way  then the professor thanked him so heartily and looked so suddenly illuminated with satisfaction that laurie thought him the most delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met  i too shall go but i shall gladly come again if you will gif me leave dear madame for a little business in the city will keep me here some days  he spoke to mrs march but he looked at jo and the mothers voice gave as cordial an assent as did the daughters eyes for mrs march was not so blind to her childrens interest as mrs moffat supposed  i suspect that is a wise man remarked mr march with placid satisfaction from the hearthrug after the last guest had gone  i know he is a good one added mrs march with decided approval as she wound up the clock  i thought youd like him was all jo said as she slipped away to her bed  she wondered what the business was that brought mr bhaer to the city and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor somewhere but had been too modest to mention the fact if she had seen his face when safe in his own room he looked at the picture of a severe and rigid young lady with a good deal of hair who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity it might have thrown some light upon the subject especially when he turned off the gas and kissed the picture in the dark     chapter fortyfour my lord and lady   please madam mother could you lend me my wife for half an hour the luggage has come and ive been making hay of amys paris finery trying to find some things i want said laurie coming in the next day to find mrs laurence sitting in her mothers lap as if being made the baby again  certainly go dear i forgot that you have any home but this and mrs march pressed the white hand that wore the wedding ring as if asking pardon for her maternal covetousness  i shouldnt have come over if i could have helped it but i cant get on without my little woman any more than a  weathercock can without the wind suggested jo as he paused for a simile jo had grown quite her own saucy self again since teddy came home  exactly for amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time with only an occasional whiffle round to the south and i havent had an easterly spell since i was married dont know anything about the north but am altogether salubrious and balmy hey my lady  lovely weather so far i dont know how long it will last but im not afraid of storms for im learning how to sail my ship come home dear and ill find your bootjack i suppose thats what you are rummaging after among my things men are so helpless mother said amy with a matronly air which delighted her husband  what are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled asked jo buttoning amys cloak as she used to button her pinafores  we have our plans we dont mean to say much about them yet because we are such very new brooms but we dont intend to be idle im going into business with a devotion that shall delight grandfather and prove to him that im not spoiled i need something of the sort to keep me steady im tired of dawdling and mean to work like a man  and amy what is she going to do asked mrs march well pleased at lauries decision and the energy with which he spoke  after doing the civil all round and airing our best bonnet we shall astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion the brilliant society we shall draw about us and the beneficial influence we shall exert over the world at large thats about it isnt it madame recamier asked laurie with a quizzical look at amy  time will show come away impertinence and dont shock my family by calling me names before their faces answered amy resolving that there should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a salon as a queen of society  how happy those children seem together observed mr march finding it difficult to become absorbed in his aristotle after the young couple had gone  yes and i think it will last added mrs march with the restful expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port  i know it will happy amy and jo sighed then smiled brightly as professor bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push  later in the evening when his mind had been set at rest about the bootjack laurie said suddenly to his wife mrs laurence  my lord  that man intends to marry our jo  i hope so dont you dear  well my love i consider him a trump in the fullest sense of that expressive word but i do wish he was a little younger and a good deal richer  now laurie dont be too fastidious and worldlyminded if they love one another it doesnt matter a particle how old they are nor how poor women never should marry for money amy caught herself up short as the words escaped her and looked at her husband who replied with malicious gravity  certainly not though you do hear charming girls say that they intend to do it sometimes if my memory serves me you once thought it your duty to make a rich match that accounts perhaps for your marrying a goodfornothing like me  oh my dearest boy dont dont say that i forgot you were rich when i said yes id have married you if you hadnt a penny and i sometimes wish you were poor that i might show how much i love you and amy who was very dignified in public and very fond in private gave convincing proofs of the truth of her words  you dont really think i am such a mercenary creature as i tried to be once do you it would break my heart if you didnt believe that id gladly pull in the same boat with you even if you had to get your living by rowing on the lake  am i an idiot and a brute how could i think so when you refused a richer man for me and wont let me give you half i want to now when i have the right girls do it every day poor things and are taught to think it is their only salvation but you had better lessons and though i trembled for you at one time i was not disappointed for the daughter was true to the mothers teaching i told mamma so yesterday and she looked as glad and grateful as if id given her a check for a million to be spent in charity you are not listening to my moral remarks mrs laurence and laurie paused for amys eyes had an absent look though fixed upon his face  yes i am and admiring the mole in your chin at the same time i dont wish to make you vain but i must confess that im prouder of my handsome husband than of all his money dont laugh but your nose is such a comfort to me and amy softly caressed the wellcut feature with artistic satisfaction  laurie had received many compliments in his life but never one that suited him better as he plainly showed though he did laugh at his wifes peculiar taste while she said slowly may i ask you a question dear  of course you may  shall you care if jo does marry mr bhaer  oh thats the trouble is it i thought there was something in the dimple that didnt quite suit you not being a dog in the manger but the happiest fellow alive i assure you i can dance at jos wedding with a heart as light as my heels do you doubt it my darling  amy looked up at him and was satisfied her little jealous fear vanished forever and she thanked him with a face full of love and confidence  i wish we could do something for that capital old professor couldnt we invent a rich relation who shall obligingly die out there in germany and leave him a tidy little fortune said laurie when they began to pace up and down the long drawing room arm in arm as they were fond of doing in memory of the chateau garden  jo would find us out and spoil it all she is very proud of him just as he is and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a beautiful thing  bless her dear heart she wont think so when she has a literary husband and a dozen little professors and professorins to support we wont interfere now but watch our chance and do them a good turn in spite of themselves i owe jo for a part of my education and she believes in peoples paying their honest debts so ill get round her in that way  how delightful it is to be able to help others isnt it that was always one of my dreams to have the power of giving freely and thanks to you the dream has come true  ah well do quantities of good wont we theres one sort of poverty that i particularly like to help outandout beggars get taken care of but poor gentle folks fare badly because they wont ask and people dont dare to offer charity yet there are a thousand ways of helping them if one only knows how to do it so delicately that it does not offend i must say i like to serve a decayed gentleman better than a blarnerying beggar i suppose its wrong but i do though it is harder  because it takes a gentleman to do it added the other member of the domestic admiration society  thank you im afraid i dont deserve that pretty compliment but i was going to say that while i was dawdling about abroad i saw a good many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices and enduring real hardships that they might realize their dreams splendid fellows some of them working like heros poor and friendless but so full of courage patience and ambition that i was ashamed of myself and longed to give them a right good lift those are people whom its a satisfaction to help for if theyve got genius its an honor to be allowed to serve them and not let it be lost or delayed for want of fuel to keep the pot boiling if they havent its a pleasure to comfort the poor souls and keep them from despair when they find it out  yes indeed and theres another class who cant ask and who suffer in silence i know something of it for i belonged to it before you made a princess of me as the king does the beggarmaid in the old story ambitious girls have a hard time laurie and often have to see youth health and precious opportunities go by just for want of a little help at the right minute people have been very kind to me and whenever i see girls struggling along as we used to do i want to put out my hand and help them as i was helped  and so you shall like an angel as you are cried laurie resolving with a glow of philanthropic zeal to found and endow an institution for the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies rich people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves or let their money accumulate for others to waste its not half so sensible to leave legacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while alive and enjoy making ones fellow creatures happy with it well have a good time ourselves and add an extra relish to our own pleasure by giving other people a generous taste will you be a little dorcas going about emptying a big basket of comforts and filling it up with good deeds  with all my heart if you will be a brave st martin stopping as you ride gallantly through the world to share your cloak with the beggar  its a bargain and we shall get the best of it  so the young pair shook hands upon it and then paced happily on again feeling that their pleasant home was more homelike because they hoped to brighten other homes believing that their own feet would walk more uprightly along the flowery path before them if they smoothed rough ways for other feet and feeling that their hearts were more closely knit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest than they     chapter fortyfive daisy and demi   i cannot feel that i have done my duty as humble historian of the march family without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious and important members of it daisy and demi had now arrived at years of discretion for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their rights and get them too which is more than many of their elders do if there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoiled by adoration it was these prattling brookes of course they were the most remarkable children ever born as will be shown when i mention that they walked at eight months talked fluently at twelve months and at two years they took their places at table and behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders at three daisy demanded a needler and actually made a bag with four stitches in it she likewise set up housekeeping in the sideboard and managed a microscopic cooking stove with a skill that brought tears of pride to hannahs eyes while demi learned his letters with his grandfather who invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters with his arms and legs thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels the boy early developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother for he tried to imitate every machine he saw and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition with his sewinsheen a mysterious structure of string chairs clothespins and spools for wheels to go wound and wound also a basket hung over the back of a chair in which he vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister who with feminine devotion allowed her little head to be bumped till rescued when the young inventor indignantly remarked why marmar dats my lellywaiter and mes trying to pull her up  though utterly unlike in character the twins got on remarkably well together and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day of course demi tyrannized over daisy and gallantly defended her from every other aggressor while daisy made a galley slave of herself and adored her brother as the one perfect being in the world a rosy chubby sunshiny little soul was daisy who found her way to everybodys heart and nestled there one of the captivating children who seem made to be kissed and cuddled adorned and adored like little goddesses and produced for general approval on all festive occasions her small virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human it was all fair weather in her world and every morning she scrambled up to the window in her little nightgown to look out and say no matter whether it rained or shone oh pitty day oh pitty day everyone was a friend and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most inveterate bachelor relented and babylovers became faithful worshipers  me loves evvybody she once said opening her arms with her spoon in one hand and her mug in the other as if eager to embrace and nourish the whole world  as she grew her mother began to feel that the dovecote would be blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which had helped to make the old house home and to pray that she might be spared a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had entertained an angel unawares her grandfather often called her beth and her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion as if trying to atone for some past mistake which no eye but her own could see  demi like a true yankee was of an inquiring turn wanting to know everything and often getting much disturbed because he could not get satisfactory answers to his perpetual what for  he also possessed a philosophic bent to the great delight of his grandfather who used to hold socratic conversations with him in which the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher to the undisguised satisfaction of the womenfolk  what makes my legs go dranpa asked the young philosopher surveying those active portions of his frame with a meditative air while resting after a gotobed frolic one night  its your little mind demi replied the sage stroking the yellow head respectfully  what is a little mine  it is something which makes your body move as the spring made the wheels go in my watch when i showed it to you  open me i want to see it go wound  i cant do that any more than you could open the watch god winds you up and you go till he stops you  does i and demis brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the new thought is i wounded up like the watch  yes but i cant show you how for it is done when we dont see  demi felt his back as if expecting to find it like that of the watch and then gravely remarked i dess dod does it when is asleep  a careful explanation followed to which he listened so attentively that his anxious grandmother said my dear do you think it wise to talk about such things to that baby hes getting great bumps over his eyes and learning to ask the most unanswerable questions  if he is old enough to ask the question he is old enough to receive true answers i am not putting the thoughts into his head but helping him unfold those already there these children are wiser than we are and i have no doubt the boy understands every word i have said to him now demi tell me where you keep your mind  if the boy had replied like alcibiades by the gods socrates i cannot tell his grandfather would not have been surprised but when after standing a moment on one leg like a meditative young stork he answered in a tone of calm conviction in my little belly the old gentleman could only join in grandmas laugh and dismiss the class in metaphysics  there might have been cause for maternal anxiety if demi had not given convincing proofs that he was a true boy as well as a budding philosopher for often after a discussion which caused hannah to prophesy with ominous nods that child aint long for this world he would turn about and set her fears at rest by some of the pranks with which dear dirty naughty little rascals distract and delight their parents souls  meg made many moral rules and tried to keep them but what mother was ever proof against the winning wiles the ingenious evasions or the tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early show themselves accomplished artful dodgers  no more raisins demi theyll make you sick says mamma to the young person who offers his services in the kitchen with unfailing regularity on plumpudding day  me likes to be sick  i dont want to have you so run away and help daisy make patty cakes  he reluctantly departs but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit and byandby when an opportunity comes to redress them he outwits mamma by a shrewd bargain  now you have been good children and ill play anything you like says meg as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs when the pudding is safely bouncing in the pot  truly marmar asks demi with a brilliant idea in his wellpowdered head  yes truly anything you say replies the shortsighted parent preparing herself to sing the three little kittens half a dozen times over or to take her family to buy a penny bun regardless of wind or limb but demi corners her by the cool reply  then well go and eat up all the raisins  aunt dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children and the trio turned the little house topsyturvy aunt amy was as yet only a name to them aunt beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory but aunt dodo was a living reality and they made the most of her for which compliment she was deeply grateful but when mr bhaer came jo neglected her playfellows and dismay and desolation fell upon their little souls daisy who was fond of going about peddling kisses lost her best customer and became bankrupt demi with infantile penetration soon discovered that dodo like to play with the bearman better than she did him but though hurt he concealed his anguish for he hadnt the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate drops in his waistcoat pocket and a watch that could be taken out of its case and freely shaken by ardent admirers  some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes but demi didnt see it in that light and continued to patronize the the bearman with pensive affability while daisy bestowed her small affections upon him at the third call and considered his shoulder her throne his arm her refuge his gifts treasures surpassing worth  gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard but this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them and does not deceive anybody a particle mr bhaers devotion was sincere however likewise effectivefor honesty is the best policy in love as in law he was one of the men who are at home with children and looked particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his manly one his business whatever it was detained him from day to day but evening seldom failed to bring him out to seewell he always asked for mr march so i suppose he was the attraction the excellent papa labored under the delusion that he was and reveled in long discussions with the kindred spirit till a chance remark of his more observing grandson suddenly enlightened him  mr bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study astonished by the spectacle that met his eye prone upon the floor lay mr march with his respectable legs in the air and beside him likewise prone was demi trying to imitate the attitude with his own short scarletstockinged legs both grovelers so seriously absorbed that they were unconscious of spectators till mr bhaer laughed his sonorous laugh and jo cried out with a scandalized face  father father heres the professor  down went the black legs and up came the gray head as the preceptor said with undisturbed dignity good evening mr bhaer excuse me for a moment we are just finishing our lesson now demi make the letter and tell its name  i knows him and after a few convulsive efforts the red legs took the shape of a pair of compasses and the intelligent pupil triumphantly shouted its a we dranpa its a we  hes a born weller laughed jo as her parent gathered himself up and her nephew tried to stand on his head as the only mode of expressing his satisfaction that school was over  what have you been at today bubchen asked mr bhaer picking up the gymnast  me went to see little mary  and what did you there  i kissed her began demi with artless frankness  prut thou beginnest early what did the little mary say to that asked mr bhaer continuing to confess the young sinner who stood upon the knee exploring the waistcoat pocket  oh she liked it and she kissed me and i liked it dont little boys like little girls asked demi with his mouth full and an air of bland satisfaction  you precocious chick who put that into your head said jo enjoying the innocent revelation as much as the professor  tisnt in mine head its in mine mouf answered literal demi putting out his tongue with a chocolate drop on it thinking she alluded to confectionery not ideas  thou shouldst save some for the little friend sweets to the sweet mannling and mr bhaer offered jo some with a look that made her wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods demi also saw the smile was impressed by it and artlessy inquired   do great boys like great girls to fessor  like young washington mr bhaer couldnt tell a lie so he gave the somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes in a tone that made mr march put down his clothesbrush glance at jos retiring face and then sink into his chair looking as if the precocious chick had put an idea into his head that was both sweet and sour  why dodo when she caught him in the china closet half an hour afterward nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a tender embrace instead of shaking him for being there and why she followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big slice of bread and jelly remained one of the problems over which demi puzzled his small wits and was forced to leave unsolved forever     chapter fortysix under the umbrella   while laurie and amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets as they set their house in order and planned a blissful future mr bhaer and jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort along muddy roads and sodden fields  i always do take a walk toward evening and i dont know why i should give it up just because i happen to meet the professor on his way out said jo to herself after two or three encounters for though there were two paths to megs whichever one she took she was sure to meet him either going or returning he was always walking rapidly and never seemed to see her until quite close when he would look as if his shortsighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till that moment then if she was going to megs he always had something for the babies if her face was turned homeward he had merely strolled down to see the river and was just returning unless they were tired of his frequent calls  under the circumstances what could jo do but greet him civilly and invite him in if she was tired of his visits she concealed her weariness with perfect skill and took care that there should be coffee for supper as friedrichi mean mr bhaerdoesnt like tea  by the second week everyone knew perfectly well what was going on yet everyone tried to look as if they were stoneblind to the changes in jos face they never asked why she sang about her work did up her hair three times a day and got so blooming with her evening exercise and no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that professor bhaer while talking philosophy with the father was giving the daughter lessons in love  jo couldnt even lose her heart in a decorous manner but sternly tried to quench her feelings and failing to do so led a somewhat agitated life she was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering after her many and vehement declarations of independence laurie was her especial dread but thanks to the new manager he behaved with praiseworthy propriety never called mr bhaer a capital old fellow in public never alluded in the remotest manner to jos improved appearance or expressed the least surprise at seeing the professors hat on the marches table nearly every evening but he exulted in private and longed for the time to come when he could give jo a piece of plate with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat of arms  for a fortnight the professor came and went with loverlike regularity then he stayed away for three whole days and made no sign a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober and jo to become pensive at first and thenalas for romancevery cross  disgusted i dare say and gone home as suddenly as he came its nothing to me of course but i should think he would have come and bid us goodbye like a gentleman she said to herself with a despairing look at the gate as she put on her things for the customary walk one dull afternoon  youd better take the little umbrella dear it looks like rain said her mother observing that she had on her new bonnet but not alluding to the fact  yes marmee do you want anything in town ive got to run in and get some paper returned jo pulling out the bow under her chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother  yes i want some twilled silesia a paper of number nine needles and two yards of narrow lavender ribbon have you got your thick boots on and something warm under your cloak  i believe so answered jo absently  if you happen to meet mr bhaer bring him home to tea i quite long to see the dear man added mrs march  jo heard that but made no answer except to kiss her mother and walk rapidly away thinking with a glow of gratitude in spite of her heartache how good she is to me what do girls do who havent any mothers to help them through their troubles  the drygoods stores were not down among the countinghouses banks and wholesale warerooms where gentlemen most do congregate but jo found herself in that part of the city before she did a single errand loitering along as if waiting for someone examining engineering instruments in one window and samples of wool in another with most unfeminine interest tumbling over barrels being halfsmothered by descending bales and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as if they wondered how the deuce she got there a drop of rain on her cheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons for the drops continued to fall and being a woman as well as a lover she felt that though it was too late to save her heart she might her bonnet now she remembered the little umbrella which she had forgotten to take in her hurry to be off but regret was unavailing and nothing could be done but borrow one or submit to a drenching she looked up at the lowering sky down at the crimson bow already flecked with black forward along the muddy street then one long lingering look behind at a certain grimy warehouse with hoffmann swartz & co over the door and said to herself with a sternly reproachful air  it serves me right what business had i to put on all my best things and come philandering down here hoping to see the professor jo im ashamed of you no you shall not go there to borrow an umbrella or find out where he is from his friends you shall trudge away and do your errands in the rain and if you catch your death and ruin your bonnet its no more than you deserve now then  with that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly escaped annihilation from a passing truck and precipitated herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman who said i beg pardon maam and looked mortally offended somewhat daunted jo righted herself spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons and putting temptation behind her hurried on with increasing dampness about the ankles and much clashing of umbrellas overhead the fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected bonnet attracted her attention and looking up she saw mr bhaer looking down  i feel to know the strongminded lady who goes so bravely under many horse noses and so fast through much mud what do you down here my friend  im shopping  mr bhaer smiled as he glanced from the pickle factory on one side to the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other but he only said politely you haf no umbrella may i go also and take for you the bundles  yes thank you  jos cheeks were as red as her ribbon and she wondered what he thought of her but she didnt care for in a minute she found herself walking away arm in arm with her professor feeling as if the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy that the world was all right again and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that day  we thought you had gone said jo hastily for she knew he was looking at her her bonnet wasnt big enough to hide her face and she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly  did you believe that i should go with no farewell to those who haf been so heavenly kind to me he asked so reproachfully that she felt as if she had insulted him by the suggestion and answered heartily  no i didnt i knew you were busy about your own affairs but we rather missed you father and mother especially  and you  im always glad to see you sir  in her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm jo made it rather cool and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the professor for his smile vanished as he said gravely  i thank you and come one more time before i go  you are going then  i haf no longer any business here it is done  successfully i hope said jo for the bitterness of disappointment was in that short reply of his  i ought to think so for i haf a way opened to me by which i can make my bread and gif my junglings much help  tell me please i like to know all about thethe boys said jo eagerly  that is so kind i gladly tell you my friends find for me a place in a college where i teach as at home and earn enough to make the way smooth for franz and emil for this i should be grateful should i not  indeed you should how splendid it will be to have you doing what you like and be able to see you often and the boys cried jo clinging to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help betraying  ah but we shall not meet often i fear this place is at the west  so far away and jo left her skirts to their fate as if it didnt matter now what became of her clothes or herself  mr bhaer could read several languages but he had not learned to read women yet he flattered himself that he knew jo pretty well and was therefore much amazed by the contradictions of voice face and manner which she showed him in rapid succession that day for she was in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour when she met him she looked surprised though it was impossible to help suspecting that she had come for that express purpose when he offered her his arm she took it with a look that filled him with delight but when he asked if she missed him she gave such a chilly formal reply that despair fell upon him on learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands was the joy all for the boys then on hearing his destination she said so far away in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a pinnacle of hope but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing like one entirely absorbed in the matter  heres the place for my errands will you come in it wont take long  jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities and particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and dispatch with which she would accomplish the business but owing to the flutter she was in everything went amiss she upset the tray of needles forgot the silesia was to be twilled till it was cut off gave the wrong change and covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon at the calico counter mr bhaer stood by watching her blush and blunder and as he watched his own bewilderment seemed to subside for he was beginning to see that on some occasions women like dreams go by contraries  when they came out he put the parcel under his arm with a more cheerful aspect and splashed through the puddles as if he rather enjoyed it on the whole  should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies and haf a farewell feast tonight if i go for my last call at your so pleasant home he asked stopping before a window full of fruit and flowers  what will we buy asked jo ignoring the latter part of his speech and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they went in  may they haf oranges and figs asked mr bhaer with a paternal air  they eat them when they can get them  do you care for nuts  like a squirrel  hamburg grapes yes we shall drink to the fatherland in those  jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance and asked why he didnt buy a frail of dates a cask of raisins and a bag of almonds and be done with it whereat mr bhaer confiscated her purse produced his own and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes a pot of rosy daisies and a pretty jar of honey to be regarded in the light of a demijohn then distorting his pockets with knobby bundles and giving her the flowers to hold he put up the old umbrella and they traveled on again  miss marsch i haf a great favor to ask of you began the professor after a moist promenade of half a block  yes sir and jos heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he would hear it  i am bold to say it in spite of the rain because so short a time remains to me  yes sir and jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden squeeze she gave it  i wish to get a little dress for my tina and i am too stupid to go alone will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help  yes sir and jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she had stepped into a refrigerator  perhaps also a shawl for tinas mother she is so poor and sick and the husband is such a care yes yes a thick warm shawl would be a friendly thing to take the little mother  ill do it with pleasure mr bhaer im going very fast and hes getting dearer every minute added jo to herself then with a mental shake she entered into the business with an energy that was pleasant to behold  mr bhaer left it all to her so she chose a pretty gown for tina and then ordered out the shawls the clerk being a married man condescended to take an interest in the couple who appeared to be shopping for their family  your lady may prefer this its a superior article a most desirable color quite chaste and genteel he said shaking out a comfortable gray shawl and throwing it over jos shoulders  does this suit you mr bhaer she asked turning her back to him and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face  excellently well we will haf it answered the professor smiling to himself as he paid for it while jo continued to rummage the counters like a confirmed bargainhunter  now shall we go home he asked as if the words were very pleasant to him  yes its late and im so tired jos voice was more pathetic than she knew for now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it came out and the world grew muddy and miserable again and for the first time she discovered that her feet were cold her head ached and that her heart was colder than the former fuller of pain than the latter mr bhaer was going away he only cared for her as a friend it was all a mistake and the sooner it was over the better with this idea in her head she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged  this is not our omniboos said the professor waving the loaded vehicle away and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers  i beg your pardon i didnt see the name distinctly never mind i can walk im used to plodding in the mud returned jo winking hard because she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes  mr bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks though she turned her head away the sight seemed to touch him very much for suddenly stooping down he asked in a tone that meant a great deal hearts dearest why do you cry  now if jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said she wasnt crying had a cold in her head or told any other feminine fib proper to the occasion instead of which that undignified creature answered with an irrepressible sob because you are going away  ach mein gott that is so good cried mr bhaer managing to clasp his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles jo i haf nothing but much love to gif you i came to see if you could care for it and i waited to be sure that i was something more than a friend am i can you make a little place in your heart for old fritz he added all in one breath  oh yes said jo and he was quite satisfied for she folded both hands over his arm and looked up at him with an expression that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella if he carried it  it was certainly proposing under difficulties for even if he had desired to do so mr bhaer could not go down upon his knees on account of the mud neither could he offer jo his hand except figuratively for both were full much less could he indulge in tender remonstrations in the open street though he was near it so the only way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her with an expression which glorified his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his beard if he had not loved jo very much i dont think he could have done it then for she looked far from lovely with her skirts in a deplorable state her rubber boots splashed to the ankle and her bonnet a ruin fortunately mr bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman living and she found him more jovelike than ever though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling thence upon his shoulders for he held the umbrella all over jo and every finger of his gloves needed mending  passersby probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics for they entirely forgot to hail a bus and strolled leisurely along oblivious of deepening dusk and fog little they cared what anybody thought for they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any life the magical moment which bestows youth on the old beauty on the plain wealth on the poor and gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven the professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom and the world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss while jo trudged beside him feeling as if her place had always been there and wondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot of course she was the first to speakintelligibly i mean for the emotional remarks which followed her impetuous oh yes were not of a coherent or reportable character  friedrich why didnt you  ah heaven she gifs me the name that no one speaks since minna died cried the professor pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful delight  i always call you so to myselfi forgot but i wont unless you like it  like it it is more sweet to me than i can tell say thou also and i shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine  isnt thou a little sentimental asked jo privately thinking it a lovely monosyllable  sentimental yes thank gott we germans believe in sentiment and keep ourselves young mit it your english you is so cold say thou hearts dearest it means so much to me pleaded mr bhaer more like a romantic student than a grave professor  well then why didnt thou tell me all this sooner asked jo bashfully  now i shall haf to show thee all my heart and i so gladly will because thou must take care of it hereafter see then my joah the dear funny little namei had a wish to tell something the day i said goodbye in new york but i thought the handsome friend was betrothed to thee and so i spoke not wouldst thou have said yes then if i had spoken  i dont know im afraid not for i didnt have any heart just then  prut that i do not believe it was asleep till the fairy prince came through the wood and waked it up ah well die erste liebe ist die beste but that i should not expect  yes the first love is the best but be so contented for i never had another teddy was only a boy and soon got over his little fancy said jo anxious to correct the professors mistake  good then i shall rest happy and be sure that thou givest me all i haf waited so long i am grown selfish as thou wilt find professorin  i like that cried jo delighted with her new name now tell me what brought you at last just when i wanted you  this and mr bhaer took a little worn paper out of his waistcoat pocket  jo unfolded it and looked much abashed for it was one of her own contributions to a paper that paid for poetry which accounted for her sending it an occasional attempt  how could that bring you she asked wondering what he meant  i found it by chance i knew it by the names and the initials and in it there was one little verse that seemed to call me read and find him i will see that you go not in the wet  in the garret   four little chests all in a row dim with dust and worn by time all fashioned and filled long ago by children now in their prime four little keys hung side by side with faded ribbons brave and gay when fastened there with childish pride long ago on a rainy day four little names one on each lid carved out by a boyish hand and underneath there lieth hid histories of the happy band once playing here and pausing oft to hear the sweet refrain that came and went on the roof aloft in the falling summer rain   meg on the first lid smooth and fair i look in with loving eyes for folded here with wellknown care a goodly gathering lies the record of a peaceful life gifts to gentle child and girl a bridal gown lines to a wife a tiny shoe a baby curl no toys in this first chest remain for all are carried away in their old age to join again in another small megs play ah happy mother well i know you hear like a sweet refrain lullabies ever soft and low in the falling summer rain   jo on the next lid scratched and worn and within a motley store of headless dolls of schoolbooks torn birds and beasts that speak no more spoils brought home from the fairy ground only trod by youthful feet dreams of a future never found memories of a past still sweet halfwrit poems stories wild april letters warm and cold diaries of a wilful child hints of a woman early old a woman in a lonely home hearing like a sad refrain be worthy love and love will come in the falling summer rain   my beth the dust is always swept from the lid that bears your name as if by loving eyes that wept by careful hands that often came death canonized for us one saint ever less human than divine and still we lay with tender plaint relics in this household shrine the silver bell so seldom rung the little cap which last she wore the fair dead catherine that hung by angels borne above her door the songs she sang without lament in her prisonhouse of pain forever are they sweetly blent with the falling summer rain   upon the last lids polished field legend now both fair and true a gallant knight bears on his shield amy in letters gold and blue within lie snoods that bound her hair slippers that have danced their last faded flowers laid by with care fans whose airy toils are past gay valentines all ardent flames trifles that have borne their part in girlish hopes and fears and shames the record of a maiden heart now learning fairer truer spells hearing like a blithe refrain the silver sound of bridal bells in the falling summer rain   four little chests all in a row dim with dust and worn by time four women taught by weal and woe to love and labor in their prime four sisters parted for an hour none lost one only gone before made by loves immortal power nearest and dearest evermore oh when these hidden stores of ours lie open to the fathers sight may they be rich in golden hours deeds that show fairer for the light lives whose brave music long shall ring like a spiritstirring strain souls that shall gladly soar and sing in the long sunshine after rain   its very bad poetry but i felt it when i wrote it one day when i was very lonely and had a good cry on a rag bag i never thought it would go where it could tell tales said jo tearing up the verses the professor had treasured so long  let it go it has done its duty and i will haf a fresh one when i read all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets said mr bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments fly away on the wind yes he added earnestly i read that and i think to myself she has a sorrow she is lonely she would find comfort in true love i haf a heart full full for her shall i not go and say if this is not too poor a thing to gif for what i shall hope to receive take it in gotts name  and so you came to find that it was not too poor but the one precious thing i needed whispered jo  i had no courage to think that at first heavenly kind as was your welcome to me but soon i began to hope and then i said i will haf her if i die for it and so i will cried mr bhaer with a defiant nod as if the walls of mist closing round them were barriers which he was to surmount or valiantly knock down  jo thought that was splendid and resolved to be worthy of her knight though he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array  what made you stay away so long she asked presently finding it so pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that she could not keep silent  it was not easy but i could not find the heart to take you from that so happy home until i could haf a prospect of one to gif you after much time perhaps and hard work how could i ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow who has no fortune but a little learning  im glad you are poor i couldnt bear a rich husband said jo decidedly adding in a softer tone dont fear poverty ive known it long enough to lose my dread and be happy working for those i love and dont call yourself oldforty is the prime of life i couldnt help loving you if you were seventy  the professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of his handkerchief if he could have got at it as he couldnt jo wiped his eyes for him and said laughing as she took away a bundle or two  i may be strongminded but no one can say im out of my sphere now for womans special mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing burdens im to carry my share friedrich and help to earn the home make up your mind to that or ill never go she added resolutely as he tried to reclaim his load  we shall see haf you patience to wait a long time jo i must go away and do my work alone i must help my boys first because even for you i may not break my word to minna can you forgif that and be happy while we hope and wait  yes i know i can for we love one another and that makes all the rest easy to bear i have my duty also and my work i couldnt enjoy myself if i neglected them even for you so theres no need of hurry or impatience you can do your part out west i can do mine here and both be happy hoping for the best and leaving the future to be as god wills  ah thou gifest me such hope and courage and i haf nothing to gif back but a full heart and these empty hands cried the professor quite overcome  jo never never would learn to be proper for when he said that as they stood upon the steps she just put both hands into his whispering tenderly not empty now and stooping down kissed her friedrich under the umbrella it was dreadful but she would have done it if the flock of draggletailed sparrows on the hedge had been human beings for she was very far gone indeed and quite regardless of everything but her own happiness though it came in such a very simple guise that was the crowning moment of both their lives when turning from the night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and peace waiting to receive them with a glad welcome home jo led her lover in and shut the door     chapter fortyseven harvest time   for a year jo and her professor worked and waited hoped and loved met occasionally and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the price of paper was accounted for laurie said the second year began rather soberly for their prospects did not brighten and aunt march died suddenly but when their first sorrow was overfor they loved the old lady in spite of her sharp tonguethey found they had cause for rejoicing for she had left plumfield to jo which made all sorts of joyful things possible  its a fine old place and will bring a handsome sum for of course you intend to sell it said laurie as they were all talking the matter over some weeks later  no i dont was jos decided answer as she petted the fat poodle whom she had adopted out of respect to his former mistress  you dont mean to live there  yes i do  but my dear girl its an immense house and will take a power of money to keep it in order the garden and orchard alone need two or three men and farming isnt in bhaers line i take it  hell try his hand at it there if i propose it  and you expect to live on the produce of the place well that sounds paradisiacal but youll find it desperate hard work  the crop we are going to raise is a profitable one and jo laughed  of what is this fine crop to consist maam  boys i want to open a school for little ladsa good happy homelike school with me to take care of them and fritz to teach them  thats a truly joian plan for you isnt that just like her cried laurie appealing to the family who looked as much surprised as he  i like it said mrs march decidedly  so do i added her husband who welcomed the thought of a chance for trying the socratic method of education on modern youth  it will be an immense care for jo said meg stroking the head of her one allabsorbing son  jo can do it and be happy in it its a splendid idea tell us all about it cried mr laurence who had been longing to lend the lovers a hand but knew that they would refuse his help  i knew youd stand by me sir amy does tooi see it in her eyes though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before she speaks now my dear people continued jo earnestly just understand that this isnt a new idea of mine but a long cherished plan before my fritz came i used to think how when id made my fortune and no one needed me at home id hire a big house and pick up some poor forlorn little lads who hadnt any mothers and take care of them and make life jolly for them before it was too late i see so many going to ruin for want of help at the right minute i love so to do anything for them i seem to feel their wants and sympathize with their troubles and oh i should so like to be a mother to them  mrs march held out her hand to jo who took it smiling with tears in her eyes and went on in the old enthusiastic way which they had not seen for a long while  i told my plan to fritz once and he said it was just what he would like and agreed to try it when we got rich bless his dear heart hes been doing it all his lifehelping poor boys i mean not getting rich that hell never be money doesnt stay in his pocket long enough to lay up any but now thanks to my good old aunt who loved me better than i ever deserved im rich at least i feel so and we can live at plumfield perfectly well if we have a flourishing school its just the place for boys the house is big and the furniture strong and plain theres plenty of room for dozens inside and splendid grounds outside they could help in the garden and orchard such work is healthy isnt it sir then fritz could train and teach in his own way and father will help him i can feed and nurse and pet and scold them and mother will be my standby ive always longed for lots of boys and never had enough now i can fill the house full and revel in the little dears to my hearts content think what luxury plumfield my own and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me  as jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture the family went off into a gale of merriment and mr laurence laughed till they thought hed have an apoplectic fit  i dont see anything funny she said gravely when she could be heard nothing could be more natural and proper than for my professor to open a school and for me to prefer to reside in my own estate  she is putting on airs already said laurie who regarded the idea in the light of a capital joke but may i inquire how you intend to support the establishment if all the pupils are little ragamuffins im afraid your crop wont be profitable in a worldly sense mrs bhaer  now dont be a wetblanket teddy of course i shall have rich pupils alsoperhaps begin with such altogether then when ive got a start i can take in a ragamuffin or two just for a relish rich peoples children often need care and comfort as well as poor ive seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants or backward ones pushed forward when its real cruelty some are naughty through mismanagment or neglect and some lose their mothers besides the best have to get through the hobbledehoy age and thats the very time they need most patience and kindness people laugh at them and hustle them about try to keep them out of sight and expect them to turn all at once from pretty children into fine young men they dont complain muchplucky little soulsbut they feel it ive been through something of it and i know all about it ive a special interest in such young bears and like to show them that i see the warm honest wellmeaning boys hearts in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the topsyturvy heads ive had experience too for havent i brought up one boy to be a pride and honor to his family  ill testify that you tried to do it said laurie with a grateful look  and ive succeeded beyond my hopes for here you are a steady sensible businessman doing heaps of good with your money and laying up the blessings of the poor instead of dollars but you are not merely a businessman you love good and beautiful things enjoy them yourself and let others go halves as you always did in the old times i am proud of you teddy for you get better every year and everyone feels it though you wont let them say so yes and when i have my flock ill just point to you and say theres your model my lads  poor laurie didnt know where to look for man though he was something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise made all faces turn approvingly upon him  i say jo thats rather too much he began just in his old boyish way you have all done more for me than i can ever thank you for except by doing my best not to disappoint you you have rather cast me off lately jo but ive had the best of help nevertheless so if ive got on at all you may thank these two for it and he laid one hand gently on his grandfathers head and the other on amys golden one for the three were never far apart  i do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world burst out jo who was in an unusually uplifted frame of mind just then when i have one of my own i hope it will be as happy as the three i know and love the best if john and my fritz were only here it would be quite a little heaven on earth she added more quietly and that night when she went to her room after a blissful evening of family counsels hopes and plans her heart was so full of happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near her own and thinking tender thoughts of beth  it was a very astonishing year altogether for things seemed to happen in an unusually rapid and delightful manner almost before she knew where she was jo found herself married and settled at plumfield then a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms and flourished surprisingly poor boys as well as rich for mr laurence was continually finding some touching case of destitution and begging the bhaers to take pity on the child and he would gladly pay a trifle for its support in this way the sly old gentleman got round proud jo and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted  of course it was uphill work at first and jo made queer mistakes but the wise professor steered her safely into calmer waters and the most rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end how jo did enjoy her wilderness of boys and how poor dear aunt march would have lamented had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim wellordered plumfield overrun with toms dicks and harrys there was a sort of poetic justice about it after all for the old lady had been the terror of the boys for miles around and now the exiles feasted freely on forbidden plums kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved and played cricket in the big field where the irritable cow with a crumpled horn used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed it became a sort of boys paradise and laurie suggested that it should be called the bhaergarten as a compliment to its master and appropriate to its inhabitants  it never was a fashionable school and the professor did not lay up a fortune but it was just what jo intended it to bea happy homelike place for boys who needed teaching care and kindness every room in the big house was soon full every little plot in the garden soon had its owner a regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed for pet animals were allowed and three times a day jo smiled at her fritz from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows of happy young faces which all turned to her with affectionate eyes confiding words and grateful hearts full of love for mother bhaer she had boys enough now and did not tire of them though they were not angels by any means and some of them caused both professor and professorin much trouble and anxiety but her faith in the good spot which exists in the heart of the naughtiest sauciest most tantalizing little ragamuffin gave her patience skill and in time success for no mortal boy could hold out long with father bhaer shining on him as benevolently as the sun and mother bhaer forgiving him seventy times seven very precious to jo was the friendship of the lads their penitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing their droll or touching little confidences their pleasant enthusiasms hopes and plans even their misfortunes for they only endeared them to her all the more there were slow boys and bashful boys feeble boys and riotous boys boys that lisped and boys that stuttered one or two lame ones and a merry little quadroon who could not be taken in elsewhere but who was welcome to the bhaergarten though some people predicted that his admission would ruin the school  yes jo was a very happy woman there in spite of hard work much anxiety and a perpetual racket she enjoyed it heartily and found the applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world for now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers and admirers as the years went on two little lads of her own came to increase her happinessrob named for grandpa and teddy a happygolucky baby who seemed to have inherited his papas sunshiny temper as well as his mothers lively spirit how they ever grew up alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and aunts but they flourished like dandelions in spring and their rough nurses loved and served them well  there were a great many holidays at plumfield and one of the most delightful was the yearly applepicking for then the marches laurences brookes and bhaers turned out in full force and made a day of it five years after jos wedding one of these fruitful festivals occurred a mellow october day when the air was full of an exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance healthily in the veins the old orchard wore its holiday attire goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls grasshoppers skipped briskly in the sere grass and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a feast squirrels were busy with their small harvesting birds twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane and every tree stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake everybody was there everybody laughed and sang climbed up and tumbled down everybody declared that there never had been such a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it and everyone gave themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things as care or sorrow in the world  mr march strolled placidly about quoting tusser cowley and columella to mr laurence while enjoying  the gentle apples winey juice  the professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout teutonic knight with a pole for a lance leading on the boys who made a hook and ladder company of themselves and performed wonders in the way of ground and lofty tumbling laurie devoted himself to the little ones rode his small daughter in a bushelbasket took daisy up among the birds nests and kept adventurous rob from breaking his neck mrs march and meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of pomonas sorting the contributions that kept pouring in while amy with a beautiful motherly expression in her face sketched the various groups and watched over one pale lad who sat adoring her with his little crutch beside him  jo was in her element that day and rushed about with her gown pinned up and her hat anywhere but on her head and her baby tucked under her arm ready for any lively adventure which might turn up little teddy bore a charmed life for nothing ever happened to him and jo never felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad galloped off on the back of another or supplied with sour russets by his indulgent papa who labored under the germanic delusion that babies could digest anything from pickled cabbage to buttons nails and their own small shoes she knew that little ted would turn up again in time safe and rosy dirty and serene and she always received him back with a hearty welcome for jo loved her babies tenderly  at four oclock a lull took place and baskets remained empty while the apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises then jo and meg with a detachment of the bigger boys set forth the supper on the grass for an outofdoor tea was always the crowning joy of the day the land literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions for the lads were not required to sit at table but allowed to partake of refreshment as they likedfreedom being the sauce best beloved by the boyish soul they availed themselves of the rare privilege to the fullest extent for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk while standing on their heads others lent a charm to leapfrog by eating pie in the pauses of the game cookies were sown broadcast over the field and apple turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of bird the little girls had a private tea party and ted roved among the edibles at his own sweet will  when no one could eat any more the professor proposed the first regular toast which was always drunk at such timesaunt march god bless her a toast heartily given by the good man who never forgot how much he owed her and quietly drunk by the boys who had been taught to keep her memory green  now grandmas sixtieth birthday long life to her with three times three  that was given with a will as you may well believe and the cheering once begun it was hard to stop it everybodys health was proposed from mr laurence who was considered their special patron to the astonished guinea pig who had strayed from its proper sphere in search of its young master demi as the oldest grandchild then presented the queen of the day with various gifts so numerous that they were transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow funny presents some of them but what would have been defects to other eyes were ornaments to grandmasfor the childrens gifts were all their own every stitch daisys patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed was better than embroidery to mrs march demis miracle of mechanical skill though the cover wouldnt shut robs footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she declared was soothing and no page of the costly book amys child gave her was so fair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals the wordsto dear grandma from her little beth  during the ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared and when mrs march had tried to thank her children and broken down while teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore the professor suddenly began to sing then from above him voice after voice took up the words and from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir as the boys sang with all their hearts the little song that jo had written laurie set to music and the professor trained his lads to give with the best effect this was something altogether new and it proved a grand success for mrs march couldnt get over her surprise and insisted on shaking hands with every one of the featherless birds from tall franz and emil to the little quadroon who had the sweetest voice of all  after this the boys dispersed for a final lark leaving mrs march and her daughters under the festival tree  i dont think i ever ought to call myself unlucky jo again when my greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified said mrs bhaer taking teddys little fist out of the milk pitcher in which he was rapturously churning  and yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long ago do you remember our castles in the air asked amy smiling as she watched laurie and john playing cricket with the boys  dear fellows it does my heart good to see them forget business and frolic for a day answered jo who now spoke in a maternal way of all mankind yes i remember but the life i wanted then seems selfish lonely and cold to me now i havent given up the hope that i may write a good book yet but i can wait and im sure it will be all the better for such experiences and illustrations as these and jo pointed from the lively lads in the distance to her father leaning on the professors arm as they walked to and fro in the sunshine deep in one of the conversations which both enjoyed so much and then to her mother sitting enthroned among her daughters with their children in her lap and at her feet as if all found help and happiness in the face which never could grow old to them  my castle was the most nearly realized of all i asked for splendid things to be sure but in my heart i knew i should be satisfied if i had a little home and john and some dear children like these ive got them all thank god and am the happiest woman in the world and meg laid her hand on her tall boys head with a face full of tender and devout content  my castle is very different from what i planned but i would not alter it though like jo i dont relinquish all my artistic hopes or confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of beauty ive begun to model a figure of baby and laurie says it is the best thing ive ever done i think so myself and mean to do it in marble so that whatever happens i may at least keep the image of my little angel  as amy spoke a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping child in her arms for her one wellbeloved daughter was a frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over amys sunshine this cross was doing much for both father and mother for one love and sorrow bound them closely together amys nature was growing sweeter deeper and more tender laurie was growing more serious strong and firm and both were learning that beauty youth good fortune even love itself cannot keep care and pain loss and sorrow from the most blessed for   into each life some rain must fall some days must be dark and sad and dreary   she is growing better i am sure of it my dear dont despond but hope and keep happy said mrs march as tenderhearted daisy stooped from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against her little cousins pale one  i never ought to while i have you to cheer me up marmee and laurie to take more than half of every burden replied amy warmly he never lets me see his anxiety but is so sweet and patient with me so devoted to beth and such a stay and comfort to me always that i cant love him enough so in spite of my one cross i can say with meg thank god im a happy woman  theres no need for me to say it for everyone can see that im far happier than i deserve added jo glancing from her good husband to her chubby children tumbling on the grass beside her fritz is getting gray and stout im growing as thin as a shadow and am thirty we never shall be rich and plumfield may burn up any night for that incorrigible tommy bangs will smoke sweetfern cigars under the bedclothes though hes set himself afire three times already but in spite of these unromantic facts i have nothing to complain of and never was so jolly in my life excuse the remark but living among boys i cant help using their expressions now and then  yes jo i think your harvest will be a good one began mrs march frightening away a big black cricket that was staring teddy out of countenance  not half so good as yours mother here it is and we never can thank you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done cried jo with the loving impetuosity which she never would outgrow  i hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year said amy softly  a large sheaf but i know theres room in your heart for it marmee dear added megs tender voice  touched to the heart mrs march could only stretch out her arms as if to gather children and grandchildren to herself and say with face and voice full of motherly love gratitude and humility  oh my girls however long you may live i never can wish you a greater happiness than this,little women,louisa may alcott        
chapter i mr sherlock holmes   in the year 1878 i took my degree of doctor of medicine of the university of london and proceeded to netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army having completed my studies there i was duly attached to the fifth northumberland fusiliers as assistant surgeon the regiment was stationed in india at the time and before i could join it the second afghan war had broken out on landing at bombay i learned that my corps had advanced through the passes and was already deep in the enemys country i followed however with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself and succeeded in reaching candahar in safety where i found my regiment and at once entered upon my new duties  the campaign brought honours and promotion to many but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster i was removed from my brigade and attached to the berkshires with whom i served at the fatal battle of maiwand there i was struck on the shoulder by a jezail bullet which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery i should have fallen into the hands of the murderous ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by murray my orderly who threw me across a packhorse and succeeded in bringing me safely to the british lines  worn with pain and weak from the prolonged hardships which i had undergone i was removed with a great train of wounded sufferers to the base hospital at peshawar here i rallied and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards and even to bask a little upon the verandah when i was struck down by enteric fever that curse of our indian possessions for months my life was despaired of and when at last i came to myself and became convalescent i was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to england i was dispatched accordingly in the troopship orontes and landed a month later on portsmouth jetty with my health irretrievably ruined but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it  i had neither kith nor kin in england and was therefore as free as airor as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be under such circumstances i naturally gravitated to london that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the empire are irresistibly drained there i stayed for some time at a private hotel in the strand leading a comfortless meaningless existence and spending such money as i had considerably more freely than i ought so alarming did the state of my finances become that i soon realized that i must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country or that i must make a complete alteration in my style of living choosing the latter alternative i began by making up my mind to leave the hotel and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile  on the very day that i had come to this conclusion i was standing at the criterion bar when some one tapped me on the shoulder and turning round i recognized young stamford who had been a dresser under me at barts the sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of london is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man in old days stamford had never been a particular crony of mine but now i hailed him with enthusiasm and he in his turn appeared to be delighted to see me in the exuberance of my joy i asked him to lunch with me at the holborn and we started off together in a hansom  whatever have you been doing with yourself watson he asked in undisguised wonder as we rattled through the crowded london streets you are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut  i gave him a short sketch of my adventures and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination  poor devil he said commiseratingly after he had listened to my misfortunes what are you up to now  looking for lodgings i answered trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price  thats a strange thing remarked my companion you are the second man today that has used that expression to me  and who was the first i asked  a fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital he was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found and which were too much for his purse  by jove i cried if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense i am the very man for him i should prefer having a partner to being alone  young stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wineglass you dont know sherlock holmes yet he said perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion  why what is there against him  oh i didnt say there was anything against him he is a little queer in his ideasan enthusiast in some branches of science as far as i know he is a decent fellow enough  a medical student i suppose said i  noi have no idea what he intends to go in for i believe he is well up in anatomy and he is a firstclass chemist but as far as i know he has never taken out any systematic medical classes his studies are very desultory and eccentric but he has amassed a lot of outofthe way knowledge which would astonish his professors  did you never ask him what he was going in for i asked  no he is not a man that it is easy to draw out though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him  i should like to meet him i said if i am to lodge with anyone i should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits i am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement i had enough of both in afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence how could i meet this friend of yours  he is sure to be at the laboratory returned my companion he either avoids the place for weeks or else he works there from morning to night if you like we shall drive round together after luncheon  certainly i answered and the conversation drifted away into other channels  as we made our way to the hospital after leaving the holborn stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom i proposed to take as a fellowlodger  you mustnt blame me if you dont get on with him he said i know nothing more of him than i have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory you proposed this arrangement so you must not hold me responsible  if we dont get on it will be easy to part company i answered it seems to me stamford i added looking hard at my companion that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter is this fellows temper so formidable or what is it dont be mealymouthed about it  it is not easy to express the inexpressible he answered with a laugh holmes is a little too scientific for my tastesit approaches to coldbloodedness i could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid not out of malevolence you understand but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects to do him justice i think that he would take it himself with the same readiness he appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge  very right too  yes but it may be pushed to excess when it comes to beating the subjects in the dissectingrooms with a stick it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape  beating the subjects  yes to verify how far bruises may be produced after death i saw him at it with my own eyes  and yet you say he is not a medical student  no heaven knows what the objects of his studies are but here we are and you must form your own impressions about him as he spoke we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small sidedoor which opened into a wing of the great hospital it was familiar ground to me and i needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and duncoloured doors near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory  this was a lofty chamber lined and littered with countless bottles broad low tables were scattered about which bristled with retorts testtubes and little bunsen lamps with their blue flickering flames there was only one student in the room who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work at the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure ive found it ive found it he shouted to my companion running towards us with a testtube in his hand i have found a reagent which is precipitated by hæmoglobin and by nothing else had he discovered a gold mine greater delight could not have shone upon his features  dr watson mr sherlock holmes said stamford introducing us  how are you he said cordially gripping my hand with a strength for which i should hardly have given him credit you have been in afghanistan i perceive  how on earth did you know that i asked in astonishment  never mind said he chuckling to himself the question now is about hæmoglobin no doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine  it is interesting chemically no doubt i answered but practically  why man it is the most practical medicolegal discovery for years dont you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains come over here now he seized me by the coatsleeve in his eagerness and drew me over to the table at which he had been working let us have some fresh blood he said digging a long bodkin into his finger and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette now i add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water you perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water the proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million i have no doubt however that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction as he spoke he threw into the vessel a few white crystals and then added some drops of a transparent fluid in an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar  ha ha he cried clapping his hands and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy what do you think of that  it seems to be a very delicate test i remarked  beautiful beautiful the old guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain so is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles the latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old now this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new had this test been invented there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes  indeed i murmured  criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point a man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed his linen or clothes are examined and brownish stains discovered upon them are they blood stains or mud stains or rust stains or fruit stains or what are they that is a question which has puzzled many an expert and why because there was no reliable test now we have the sherlock holmes test and there will no longer be any difficulty  his eyes fairly glittered as he spoke and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination  you are to be congratulated i remarked considerably surprised at his enthusiasm  there was the case of von bischoff at frankfort last year he would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence then there was mason of bradford and the notorious muller and lefevre of montpellier and samson of new orleans i could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive  you seem to be a walking calendar of crime said stamford with a laugh you might start a paper on those lines call it the police news of the past  very interesting reading it might be made too remarked sherlock holmes sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger i have to be careful he continued turning to me with a smile for i dabble with poisons a good deal he held out his hand as he spoke and i noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster and discoloured with strong acids  we came here on business said stamford sitting down on a high threelegged stool and pushing another one in my direction with his foot my friend here wants to take diggings and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you i thought that i had better bring you together  sherlock holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me i have my eye on a suite in baker street he said which would suit us down to the ground you dont mind the smell of strong tobacco i hope  i always smoke ships myself i answered  thats good enough i generally have chemicals about and occasionally do experiments would that annoy you  by no means  let me seewhat are my other shortcomings i get in the dumps at times and dont open my mouth for days on end you must not think i am sulky when i do that just let me alone and ill soon be right what have you to confess now its just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together  i laughed at this crossexamination i keep a bull pup i said and i object to rows because my nerves are shaken and i get up at all sorts of ungodly hours and i am extremely lazy i have another set of vices when im well but those are the principal ones at present  do you include violinplaying in your category of rows he asked anxiously  it depends on the player i answered a wellplayed violin is a treat for the godsa badlyplayed one  oh thats all right he cried with a merry laugh i think we may consider the thing as settledthat is if the rooms are agreeable to you  when shall we see them  call for me here at noon tomorrow and well go together and settle everything he answered  all rightnoon exactly said i shaking his hand  we left him working among his chemicals and we walked together towards my hotel  by the way i asked suddenly stopping and turning upon stamford how the deuce did he know that i had come from afghanistan  my companion smiled an enigmatical smile thats just his little peculiarity he said a good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out  oh a mystery is it i cried rubbing my hands this is very piquant i am much obliged to you for bringing us together the proper study of mankind is man you know  you must study him then stamford said as he bade me goodbye youll find him a knotty problem though ill wager he learns more about you than you about him goodbye  goodbye i answered and strolled on to my hotel considerably interested in my new acquaintance     chapter ii the science of deduction   we met next day as he had arranged and inspected the rooms at no 221b baker street of which he had spoken at our meeting they consisted of a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sittingroom cheerfully furnished and illuminated by two broad windows so desirable in every way were the apartments and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us that the bargain was concluded upon the spot and we at once entered into possession that very evening i moved my things round from the hotel and on the following morning sherlock holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus for a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage that done we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings  holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with he was quiet in his ways and his habits were regular it was rare for him to be up after ten at night and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before i rose in the morning sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory sometimes in the dissectingrooms and occasionally in long walks which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the city nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him but now and again a reaction would seize him and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sittingroom hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night on these occasions i have noticed such a dreamy vacant expression in his eyes that i might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion  as the weeks went by my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life gradually deepened and increased his very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer in height he was rather over six feet and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller his eyes were sharp and piercing save during those intervals of torpor to which i have alluded and his thin hawklike nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision his chin too had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination his hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch as i frequently had occasion to observe when i watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments  the reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody when i confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity and how often i endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself before pronouncing judgment however be it remembered how objectless was my life and how little there was to engage my attention my health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial and i had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence under these circumstances i eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it  he was not studying medicine he had himself in reply to a question confirmed stamfords opinion upon that point neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning no man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so  his ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge of contemporary literature philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing upon my quoting thomas carlyle he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done my surprise reached a climax however when i found incidentally that he was ignorant of the copernican theory and of the composition of the solar system that any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that i could hardly realize it  you appear to be astonished he said smiling at my expression of surprise now that i do know it i shall do my best to forget it  to forget it  you see he explained i consider that a mans brain originally is like a little empty attic and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose a fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brainattic he will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work but of these he has a large assortment and all in the most perfect order it is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before it is of the highest importance therefore not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones  but the solar system i protested  what the deuce is it to me he interrupted impatiently you say that we go round the sun if we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work  i was on the point of asking him what that work might be but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one i pondered over our short conversation however and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it he said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him i enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally wellinformed i even took a pencil and jotted them down i could not help smiling at the document when i had completed it it ran in this way   sherlock holmeshis limits   1 knowledge of literaturenil 2 philosophynil 3 astronomynil 4 politicsfeeble 5 botanyvariable well up in belladonna opium and poisons generally knows nothing of practical gardening 6 geologypractical but limited tells at a glance different soils from each other after walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of london he had received them 7

singlestick player boxer and swordsman 12 has a good practical knowledge of british law   when i had got so far in my list i threw it into the fire in despair if i can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments and discovering a calling which needs them all i said to myself i may as well give up the attempt at once  i see that i have alluded above to his powers upon the violin these were very remarkable but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments that he could play pieces and difficult pieces i knew well because at my request he has played me some of mendelssohns lieder and other favourites when left to himself however he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air leaning back in his armchair of an evening he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him but whether the music aided those thoughts or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than i could determine i might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience  during the first week or so we had no callers and i had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as i was myself presently however i found that he had many acquaintances and those in the most different classes of society there was one little sallow ratfaced darkeyed fellow who was introduced to me as mr lestrade and who came three or four times in a single week one morning a young girl called fashionably dressed and stayed for half an hour or more the same afternoon brought a greyheaded seedy visitor looking like a jew pedlar who appeared to me to be much excited and who was closely followed by a slipshod elderly woman on another occasion an old whitehaired gentleman had an interview with my companion and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform when any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance sherlock holmes used to beg for the use of the sittingroom and i would retire to my bedroom he always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience i have to use this room as a place of business he said and these people are my clients again i had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me i imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord  it was upon the 4th of march as i have good reason to remember that i rose somewhat earlier than usual and found that sherlock holmes had not yet finished his breakfast the landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared with the unreasonable petulance of mankind i rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that i was ready then i picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it while my companion munched silently at his toast one of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading and i naturally began to run my eye through it  its somewhat ambitious title was the book of life and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way it struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity the reasoning was close and intense but the deductions appeared to me to be farfetched and exaggerated the writer claimed by a momentary expression a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye to fathom a mans inmost thoughts deceit according to him was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis his conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of euclid so startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer  from a drop of water said the writer a logician could infer the possibility of an atlantic or a niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other so all life is a great chain the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it like all other arts the science of deduction and analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems let him on meeting a fellowmortal learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man and the trade or profession to which he belongs puerile as such an exercise may seem it sharpens the faculties of observation and teaches one where to look and what to look for by a mans finger nails by his coatsleeve by his boot by his trouser knees by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb by his expression by his shirt cuffsby each of these things a mans calling is plainly revealed that all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable  what ineffable twaddle i cried slapping the magazine down on the table i never read such rubbish in my life  what is it asked sherlock holmes  why this article i said pointing at it with my egg spoon as i sat down to my breakfast i see that you have read it since you have marked it i dont deny that it is smartly written it irritates me though it is evidently the theory of some armchair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study it is not practical i should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the underground and asked to give the trades of all his fellowtravellers i would lay a thousand to one against him  you would lose your money sherlock holmes remarked calmly as for the article i wrote it myself  you  yes i have a turn both for observation and for deduction the theories which i have expressed there and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practicalso practical that i depend upon them for my bread and cheese  and how i asked involuntarily  well i have a trade of my own i suppose i am the only one in the world im a consulting detective if you can understand what that is here in london we have lots of government detectives and lots of private ones when these fellows are at fault they come to me and i manage to put them on the right scent they lay all the evidence before me and i am generally able by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime to set them straight there is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends it is odd if you cant unravel the thousand and first lestrade is a wellknown detective he got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case and that was what brought him here  and these other people  they are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies they are all people who are in trouble about something and want a little enlightening i listen to their story they listen to my comments and then i pocket my fee  but do you mean to say i said that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of although they have seen every detail for themselves  quite so i have a kind of intuition that way now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex then i have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes you see i have a lot of special knowledge which i apply to the problem and which facilitates matters wonderfully those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn are invaluable to me in practical work observation with me is second nature you appeared to be surprised when i told you on our first meeting that you had come from afghanistan  you were told no doubt  nothing of the sort i knew you came from afghanistan from long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind that i arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps there were such steps however the train of reasoning ran here is a gentleman of a medical type but with the air of a military man clearly an army doctor then he has just come from the tropics for his face is dark and that is not the natural tint of his skin for his wrists are fair he has undergone hardship and sickness as his haggard face says clearly his left arm has been injured he holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner where in the tropics could an english army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded clearly in afghanistan the whole train of thought did not occupy a second i then remarked that you came from afghanistan and you were astonished  it is simple enough as you explain it i said smiling you remind me of edgar allen poes dupin i had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories  sherlock holmes rose and lit his pipe no doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to dupin he observed now in my opinion dupin was a very inferior fellow that trick of his of breaking in on his friends thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hours silence is really very showy and superficial he had some analytical genius no doubt but he was by no means such a phenomenon as poe appeared to imagine  have you read gaboriaus works i asked does lecoq come up to your idea of a detective  sherlock holmes sniffed sardonically lecoq was a miserable bungler he said in an angry voice he had only one thing to recommend him and that was his energy that book made me positively ill the question was how to identify an unknown prisoner i could have done it in twentyfour hours lecoq took six months or so it might be made a textbook for detectives to teach them what to avoid  i felt rather indignant at having two characters whom i had admired treated in this cavalier style i walked over to the window and stood looking out into the busy street this fellow may be very clever i said to myself but he is certainly very conceited  there are no crimes and no criminals in these days he said querulously what is the use of having brains in our profession i know well that i have it in me to make my name famous no man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which i have done and what is the result there is no crime to detect or at most some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a scotland yard official can see through it  i was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation i thought it best to change the topic  i wonder what that fellow is looking for i asked pointing to a stalwart plainlydressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street looking anxiously at the numbers he had a large blue envelope in his hand and was evidently the bearer of a message  you mean the retired sergeant of marines said sherlock holmes  brag and bounce thought i to myself he knows that i cannot verify his guess  the thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door and ran rapidly across the roadway we heard a loud knock a deep voice below and heavy steps ascending the stair  for mr sherlock holmes he said stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter  here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him he little thought of this when he made that random shot may i ask my lad i said in the blandest voice what your trade may be  commissionaire sir he said gruffly uniform away for repairs  and you were i asked with a slightly malicious glance at my companion  a sergeant sir royal marine light infantry sir no answer right sir  he clicked his heels together raised his hand in a salute and was gone     chapter iii the lauriston gardens mystery   i confess that i was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companions theories my respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously there still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind however that the whole thing was a prearranged episode intended to dazzle me though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension when i looked at him he had finished reading the note and his eyes had assumed the vacant lacklustre expression which showed mental abstraction  how in the world did you deduce that i asked  deduce what said he petulantly  why that he was a retired sergeant of marines  i have no time for trifles he answered brusquely then with a smile excuse my rudeness you broke the thread of my thoughts but perhaps it is as well so you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of marines  no indeed  it was easier to know it than to explain why i knew it if you were asked to prove that two and two made four you might find some difficulty and yet you are quite sure of the fact even across the street i could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellows hand that smacked of the sea he had a military carriage however and regulation side whiskers there we have the marine he was a man with some amount of selfimportance and a certain air of command you must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane a steady respectable middleaged man too on the face of himall facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant  wonderful i ejaculated  commonplace said holmes though i thought from his expression that he was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration i said just now that there were no criminals it appears that i am wronglook at this he threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought  why i cried as i cast my eye over it this is terrible  it does seem to be a little out of the common he remarked calmly would you mind reading it to me aloud  this is the letter which i read to him  my dear mr sherlock holmes  there has been a bad business during the night at 3 lauriston gardens off the brixton road our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the morning and as the house was an empty one suspected that something was amiss he found the door open and in the front room which is bare of furniture discovered the body of a gentleman well dressed and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of enoch j drebber cleveland ohio usa there had been no robbery nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death there are marks of blood in the room but there is no wound upon his person we are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house indeed the whole affair is a puzzler if you can come round to the house any time before twelve you will find me there i have left everything in statu quo until i hear from you if you are unable to come i shall give you fuller details and would esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion                yours faithfully                   tobias gregson  gregson is the smartest of the scotland yarders my friend remarked he and lestrade are the pick of a bad lot they are both quick and energetic but conventionalshockingly so they have their knives into one another too they are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties there will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the scent  i was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on surely there is not a moment to be lost i cried shall i go and order you a cab  im not sure about whether i shall go i am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leatherthat is when the fit is on me for i can be spry enough at times  why it is just such a chance as you have been longing for  my dear fellow what does it matter to me supposing i unravel the whole matter you may be sure that gregson lestrade and co will pocket all the credit that comes of being an unofficial personage  but he begs you to help him  yes he knows that i am his superior and acknowledges it to me but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person however we may as well go and have a look i shall work it out on my own hook i may have a laugh at them if i have nothing else come on  he hustled on his overcoat and bustled about in a way that showed that an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one  get your hat he said  you wish me to come  yes if you have nothing better to do a minute later we were both in a hansom driving furiously for the brixton road  it was a foggy cloudy morning and a duncoloured veil hung over the housetops looking like the reflection of the mudcoloured streets beneath my companion was in the best of spirits and prattled away about cremona fiddles and the difference between a stradivarius and an amati as for myself i was silent for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged depressed my spirits  you dont seem to give much thought to the matter in hand i said at last interrupting holmes musical disquisition  no data yet he answered it is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence it biases the judgment  you will have your data soon i remarked pointing with my finger this is the brixton road and that is the house if i am not very much mistaken  so it is stop driver stop we were still a hundred yards or so from it but he insisted upon our alighting and we finished our journey upon foot  number 3 lauriston gardens wore an illomened and minatory look it was one of four which stood back some little way from the street two being occupied and two empty the latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows which were blank and dreary save that here and there a to let card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes a small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street and was traversed by a narrow pathway yellowish in colour and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel the whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night the garden was bounded by a threefoot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable surrounded by a small knot of loafers who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within  i had imagined that sherlock holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery nothing appeared to be further from his intention with an air of nonchalance which under the circumstances seemed to me to border upon affectation he lounged up and down the pavement and gazed vacantly at the ground the sky the opposite houses and the line of railings having finished his scrutiny he proceeded slowly down the path or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground twice he stopped and once i saw him smile and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction there were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil but since the police had been coming and going over it i was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it still i had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties that i had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me  at the door of the house we were met by a tall whitefaced flaxenhaired man with a notebook in his hand who rushed forward and wrung my companions hand with effusion it is indeed kind of you to come he said i have had everything left untouched  except that my friend answered pointing at the pathway if a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess no doubt however you had drawn your own conclusions gregson before you permitted this  i have had so much to do inside the house the detective said evasively my colleague mr lestrade is here i had relied upon him to look after this  holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically with two such men as yourself and lestrade upon the ground there will not be much for a third party to find out he said  gregson rubbed his hands in a selfsatisfied way i think we have done all that can be done he answered its a queer case though and i knew your taste for such things  you did not come here in a cab asked sherlock holmes  no sir  nor lestrade  no sir  then let us go and look at the room with which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house followed by gregson whose features expressed his astonishment  a short passage bare planked and dusty led to the kitchen and offices two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right one of these had obviously been closed for many weeks the other belonged to the diningroom which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred holmes walked in and i followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires  it was a large square room looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture a vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls but it was blotched in places with mildew and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down exposing the yellow plaster beneath opposite the door was a showy fireplace surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble on one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle the solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain giving a dull grey tinge to everything which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment  all these details i observed afterwards at present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling it was that of a man about fortythree or fortyfour years of age middlesized broad shouldered with crisp curling black hair and a short stubbly beard he was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat with lightcoloured trousers and immaculate collar and cuffs a top hat well brushed and trim was placed upon the floor beside him his hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one on his rigid face there stood an expression of horror and as it seemed to me of hatred such as i have never seen upon human features this malignant and terrible contortion combined with the low forehead blunt nose and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and apelike appearance which was increased by his writhing unnatural posture i have seen death in many forms but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban london  lestrade lean and ferretlike as ever was standing by the doorway and greeted my companion and myself  this case will make a stir sir he remarked it beats anything i have seen and i am no chicken  there is no clue said gregson  none at all chimed in lestrade  sherlock holmes approached the body and kneeling down examined it intently you are sure that there is no wound he asked pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round  positive cried both detectives  then of course this blood belongs to a second individualpresumably the murderer if murder has been committed it reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of van jansen in utrecht in the year 34 do you remember the case gregson  no sir  read it upyou really should there is nothing new under the sun it has all been done before  as he spoke his nimble fingers were flying here there and everywhere feeling pressing unbuttoning examining while his eyes wore the same faraway expression which i have already remarked upon so swiftly was the examination made that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted finally he sniffed the dead mans lips and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots  he has not been moved at all he asked  no more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination  you can take him to the mortuary now he said there is nothing more to be learned  gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand at his call they entered the room and the stranger was lifted and carried out as they raised him a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes  theres been a woman here he cried its a womans weddingring  he held it out as he spoke upon the palm of his hand we all gathered round him and gazed at it there could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride  this complicates matters said gregson heaven knows they were complicated enough before  youre sure it doesnt simplify them observed holmes theres nothing to be learned by staring at it what did you find in his pockets  we have it all here said gregson pointing to a litter of objects upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs a gold watch no 97163 by barraud of london gold albert chain very heavy and solid gold ring with masonic device gold pinbulldogs head with rubies as eyes russian leather cardcase with cards of enoch j drebber of cleveland corresponding with the e j d upon the linen no purse but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen pocket edition of boccaccios decameron with name of joseph stangerson upon the flyleaf two lettersone addressed to e j drebber and one to joseph stangerson  at what address  american exchange strandto be left till called for they are both from the guion steamship company and refer to the sailing of their boats from liverpool it is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to new york  have you made any inquiries as to this man stangerson  i did it at once sir said gregson i have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers and one of my men has gone to the american exchange but he has not returned yet  have you sent to cleveland  we telegraphed this morning  how did you word your inquiries  we simply detailed the circumstances and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us  you did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial  i asked about stangerson  nothing else is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge will you not telegraph again  i have said all i have to say said gregson in an offended voice  sherlock holmes chuckled to himself and appeared to be about to make some remark when lestrade who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall reappeared upon the scene rubbing his hands in a pompous and selfsatisfied manner  mr gregson he said i have just made a discovery of the highest importance and one which would have been overlooked had i not made a careful examination of the walls  the little mans eyes sparkled as he spoke and he was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague  come here he said bustling back into the room the atmosphere of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate now stand there  he struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall  look at that he said triumphantly  i have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts in this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering across this bare space there was scrawled in bloodred letters a single word   rache   what do you think of that cried the detective with the air of a showman exhibiting his show this was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room and no one thought of looking there the murderer has written it with his or her own blood see this smear where it has trickled down the wall that disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow why was that corner chosen to write it on i will tell you see that candle on the mantelpiece it was lit at the time and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall  and what does it mean now that you have found it asked gregson in a depreciatory voice  mean why it means that the writer was going to put the female name rachel but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish you mark my words when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named rachel has something to do with it its all very well for you to laugh mr sherlock holmes you may be very smart and clever but the old hound is the best when all is said and done  i really beg your pardon said my companion who had ruffled the little mans temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter you certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out and as you say it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last nights mystery i have not had time to examine this room yet but with your permission i shall do so now  as he spoke he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from his pocket with these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room sometimes stopping occasionally kneeling and once lying flat upon his face so engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time keeping up a running fire of exclamations groans whistles and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope as i watched him i was irresistibly reminded of a pureblooded welltrained foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert whining in its eagerness until it comes across the lost scent for twenty minutes or more he continued his researches measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner in one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor and packed it away in an envelope finally he examined with his glass the word upon the wall going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness this done he appeared to be satisfied for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket  they say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains he remarked with a smile its a very bad definition but it does apply to detective work  gregson and lestrade had watched the manœuvres of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt they evidently failed to appreciate the fact which i had begun to realize that sherlock holmes smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end  what do you think of it sir they both asked  it would be robbing you of the credit of the case if i was to presume to help you remarked my friend you are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere there was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke if you will let me know how your investigations go he continued i shall be happy to give you any help i can in the meantime i should like to speak to the constable who found the body can you give me his name and address  lestrade glanced at his notebook john rance he said he is off duty now you will find him at 46 audley court kennington park gate  holmes took a note of the address  come along doctor he said we shall go and look him up ill tell you one thing which may help you in the case he continued turning to the two detectives there has been murder done and the murderer was a man he was more than six feet high was in the prime of life had small feet for his height wore coarse squaretoed boots and smoked a trichinopoly cigar he came here with his victim in a fourwheeled cab which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg in all probability the murderer had a florid face and the fingernails of his right hand were remarkably long these are only a few indications but they may assist you  lestrade and gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile  if this man was murdered how was it done asked the former  poison said sherlock holmes curtly and strode off one other thing lestrade he added turning round at the door  rache is the german for revenge so dont lose your time looking for miss rachel  with which parthian shot he walked away leaving the two rivals openmouthed behind him     chapter iv what john rance had to tell   it was one oclock when we left no 3 lauriston gardens sherlock holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office whence he dispatched a long telegram he then hailed a cab and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by lestrade  there is nothing like first hand evidence he remarked as a matter of fact my mind is entirely made up upon the case but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned  you amaze me holmes said i surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave  theres no room for a mistake he answered the very first thing which i observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb now up to last night we have had no rain for a week so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night there were the marks of the horses hoofs too the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three showing that that was a new shoe since the cab was there after the rain began and was not there at any time during the morningi have gregsons word for thatit follows that it must have been there during the night and therefore that it brought those two individuals to the house  that seems simple enough said i but how about the other mans height  why the height of a man in nine cases out of ten can be told from the length of his stride it is a simple calculation enough though there is no use my boring you with figures i had this fellows stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within then i had a way of checking my calculation when a man writes on a wall his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes now that writing was just over six feet from the ground it was childs play  and his age i asked  well if a man can stride four and ahalf feet without the smallest effort he cant be quite in the sere and yellow that was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across patentleather boots had gone round and squaretoes had hopped over there is no mystery about it at all i am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which i advocated in that article is there anything else that puzzles you  the finger nails and the trichinopoly i suggested  the writing on the wall was done with a mans forefinger dipped in blood my glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it which would not have been the case if the mans nail had been trimmed i gathered up some scattered ash from the floor it was dark in colour and flakeysuch an ash as is only made by a trichinopoly i have made a special study of cigar ashesin fact i have written a monograph upon the subject i flatter myself that i can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand either of cigar or of tobacco it is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the gregson and lestrade type  and the florid face i asked  ah that was a more daring shot though i have no doubt that i was right you must not ask me that at the present state of the affair  i passed my hand over my brow my head is in a whirl i remarked the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows how came these two menif there were two meninto an empty house what has become of the cabman who drove them how could one man compel another to take poison where did the blood come from what was the object of the murderer since robbery had no part in it how came the womans ring there above all why should the second man write up the german word rache before decamping i confess that i cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts  my companion smiled approvingly  you sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well he said there is much that is still obscure though i have quite made up my mind on the main facts as to poor lestrades discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track by suggesting socialism and secret societies it was not done by a german the a if you noticed was printed somewhat after the german fashion now a real german invariably prints in the latin character so that we may safely say that this was not written by one but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part it was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel im not going to tell you much more of the case doctor you know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick and if i show you too much of my method of working you will come to the conclusion that i am a very ordinary individual after all  i shall never do that i answered you have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world  my companion flushed up with pleasure at my words and the earnest way in which i uttered them i had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty  ill tell you one other thing he said patentleathers and squaretoes came in the same cab and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possiblearminarm in all probability when they got inside they walked up and down the roomor rather patentleathers stood still while squaretoes walked up and down i could read all that in the dust and i could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited that is shown by the increased length of his strides he was talking all the while and working himself up no doubt into a fury then the tragedy occurred ive told you all i know myself now for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture we have a good working basis however on which to start we must hurry up for i want to go to halles concert to hear norman neruda this afternoon  this conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary byways in the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand thats audley court in there he said pointing to a narrow slit in the line of deadcoloured brick youll find me here when you come back  audley court was not an attractive locality the narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings we picked our way among groups of dirty children and through lines of discoloured linen until we came to number 46 the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name rance was engraved on enquiry we found that the constable was in bed and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming  he appeared presently looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers i made my report at the office he said  holmes took a halfsovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively we thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips he said  i shall be most happy to tell you anything i can the constable answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk  just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred  rance sat down on the horsehair sofa and knitted his brows as though determined not to omit anything in his narrative  ill tell it ye from the beginning he said my time is from ten at night to six in the morning at eleven there was a fight at the white hart but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat at one oclock it began to rain and i met harry murcherhim who has the holland grove beatand we stood together at the corner of henrietta street atalkin presentlymaybe about two or a little afteri thought i would take a look round and see that all was right down the brixton road it was precious dirty and lonely not a soul did i meet all the way down though a cab or two went past me i was a strollin down thinkin between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house now i knew that them two houses in lauriston gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who wont have the drains seen to though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o typhoid fever i was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window and i suspected as something was wrong when i got to the door  you stopped and then walked back to the garden gate my companion interrupted what did you do that for  rance gave a violent jump and stared at sherlock holmes with the utmost amazement upon his features  why thats true sir he said though how you come to know it heaven only knows ye see when i got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome that i thought id be none the worse for some one with me i aint afeared of anything on this side o the grave but i thought that maybe it was him that died o the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him the thought gave me a kind o turn and i walked back to the gate to see if i could see murchers lantern but there wasnt no sign of him nor of anyone else  there was no one in the street  not a livin soul sir nor as much as a dog then i pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open all was quiet inside so i went into the room where the light was aburnin there was a candle flickerin on the mantelpiecea red wax oneand by its light i saw  yes i know all that you saw you walked round the room several times and you knelt down by the body and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door and then  john rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his eyes where was you hid to see all that he cried it seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should  holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable dont get arresting me for the murder he said i am one of the hounds and not the wolf mr gregson or mr lestrade will answer for that go on though what did you do next  rance resumed his seat without however losing his mystified expression i went back to the gate and sounded my whistle that brought murcher and two more to the spot  was the street empty then  well it was as far as anybody that could be of any good goes  what do you mean  the constables features broadened into a grin ive seen many a drunk chap in my time he said but never anyone so cryin drunk as that cove he was at the gate when i came out aleanin up agin the railings and asingin at the pitch o his lungs about columbines newfangled banner or some such stuff he couldnt stand far less help  what sort of a man was he asked sherlock holmes  john rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression he was an uncommon drunk sort o man he said hed ha found hisself in the station if we hadnt been so took up  his facehis dressdidnt you notice them holmes broke in impatiently  i should think i did notice them seeing that i had to prop him upme and murcher between us he was a long chap with a red face the lower part muffled round  that will do cried holmes what became of him  wed enough to do without lookin after him the policeman said in an aggrieved voice ill wager he found his way home all right  how was he dressed  a brown overcoat  had he a whip in his hand  a whipno  he must have left it behind muttered my companion you didnt happen to see or hear a cab after that  no  theres a halfsovereign for you my companion said standing up and taking his hat i am afraid rance that you will never rise in the force that head of yours should be for use as well as ornament you might have gained your sergeants stripes last night the man whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery and whom we are seeking there is no use of arguing about it now i tell you that it is so come along doctor  we started off for the cab together leaving our informant incredulous but obviously uncomfortable  the blundering fool holmes said bitterly as we drove back to our lodgings just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck and not taking advantage of it  i am rather in the dark still it is true that the description of this man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery but why should he come back to the house after leaving it that is not the way of criminals  the ring man the ring  that was what he came back for if we have no other way of catching him we can always bait our line with the ring i shall have him doctorill lay you two to one that i have him i must thank you for it all i might not have gone but for you and so have missed the finest study i ever came across  a study in scarlet eh why shouldnt we use a little art jargon theres the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life and our duty is to unravel it and isolate it and expose every inch of it and now for lunch and then for norman neruda her attack and her bowing are splendid whats that little thing of chopins she plays so magnificently  tralalaliraliralay  leaning back in the cab this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark while i meditated upon the manysidedness of the human mind     chapter v our advertisement brings a visitor   our mornings exertions had been too much for my weak health and i was tired out in the afternoon after holmes departure for the concert i lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours sleep it was a useless attempt my mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it every time that i closed my eyes i saw before me the distorted baboonlike countenance of the murdered man so sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that i found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world if ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type they were certainly those of enoch j drebber of cleveland still i recognized that justice must be done and that the depravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law  the more i thought of it the more extraordinary did my companions hypothesis that the man had been poisoned appear i remembered how he had sniffed his lips and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea then again if not poison what had caused the mans death since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation but on the other hand whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor there were no signs of a struggle nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist as long as all these questions were unsolved i felt that sleep would be no easy matter either for holmes or myself his quiet selfconfident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all the facts though what it was i could not for an instant conjecture  he was very late in returningso late that i knew that the concert could not have detained him all the time dinner was on the table before he appeared  it was magnificent he said as he took his seat do you remember what darwin says about music he claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it there are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood  thats rather a broad idea i remarked  ones ideas must be as broad as nature if they are to interpret nature he answered whats the matter youre not looking quite yourself this brixton road affair has upset you  to tell the truth it has i said i ought to be more casehardened after my afghan experiences i saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at maiwand without losing my nerve  i can understand there is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination where there is no imagination there is no horror have you seen the evening paper  no  it gives a fairly good account of the affair it does not mention the fact that when the man was raised up a womans wedding ring fell upon the floor it is just as well it does not  why  look at this advertisement he answered i had one sent to every paper this morning immediately after the affair  he threw the paper across to me and i glanced at the place indicated it was the first announcement in the found column in brixton road this morning it ran a plain gold wedding ring found in the roadway between the white hart tavern and holland grove apply dr watson 221b baker street between eight and nine this evening  excuse my using your name he said if i used my own some of these dunderheads would recognize it and want to meddle in the affair  that is all right i answered but supposing anyone applies i have no ring  oh yes you have said he handing me one this will do very well it is almost a facsimile  and who do you expect will answer this advertisement  why the man in the brown coatour florid friend with the square toes if he does not come himself he will send an accomplice  would he not consider it as too dangerous  not at all if my view of the case is correct and i have every reason to believe that it is this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring according to my notion he dropped it while stooping over drebbers body and did not miss it at the time after leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back but found the police already in possession owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning he had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate now put yourself in that mans place on thinking the matter over it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving the house what would he do then he would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found his eye of course would light upon this he would be overjoyed why should he fear a trap there would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder he would come he will come you shall see him within an hour  and then i asked  oh you can leave me to deal with him then have you any arms  i have my old service revolver and a few cartridges  you had better clean it and load it he will be a desperate man and though i shall take him unawares it is as well to be ready for anything  i went to my bedroom and followed his advice when i returned with the pistol the table had been cleared and holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin  the plot thickens he said as i entered i have just had an answer to my american telegram my view of the case is the correct one  and that is i asked eagerly  my fiddle would be the better for new strings he remarked put your pistol in your pocket when the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary way leave the rest to me dont frighten him by looking at him too hard  it is eight oclock now i said glancing at my watch  yes he will probably be here in a few minutes open the door slightly that will do now put the key on the inside thank you this is a queer old book i picked up at a stall yesterdayde jure inter gentespublished in latin at liege in the lowlands in 1642 charles head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brownbacked volume was struck off  who is the printer  philippe de croy whoever he may have been on the flyleaf in very faded ink is written ex libris guliolmi whyte i wonder who william whyte was some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer i suppose his writing has a legal twist about it here comes our man i think  as he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell sherlock holmes rose softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door we heard the servant pass along the hall and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it  does dr watson live here asked a clear but rather harsh voice we could not hear the servants reply but the door closed and some one began to ascend the stairs the footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one a look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it it came slowly along the passage and there was a feeble tap at the door  come in i cried  at my summons instead of the man of violence whom we expected a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment she appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light and after dropping a curtsey she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous shaky fingers i glanced at my companion and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all i could do to keep my countenance  the old crone drew out an evening paper and pointed at our advertisement its this as has brought me good gentlemen she said dropping another curtsey a gold wedding ring in the brixton road it belongs to my girl sally as was married only this time twelvemonth which her husband is steward aboard a union boat and what hed say if he come ome and found her without her ring is more than i can think he being short enough at the best o times but more especially when he has the drink if it please you she went to the circus last night along with  is that her ring i asked  the lord be thanked cried the old woman sally will be a glad woman this night thats the ring  and what may your address be i inquired taking up a pencil  13 duncan street houndsditch a weary way from here  the brixton road does not lie between any circus and houndsditch said sherlock holmes sharply  the old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little redrimmed eyes the gentleman asked me for my address she said sally lives in lodgings at 3 mayfield place peckham  and your name is  my name is sawyerhers is dennis which tom dennis married herand a smart clean lad too as long as hes at sea and no steward in the company more thought of but when on shore what with the women and what with liquor shops  here is your ring mrs sawyer i interrupted in obedience to a sign from my companion it clearly belongs to your daughter and i am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner  with many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone packed it away in her pocket and shuffled off down the stairs sherlock holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room he returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat ill follow her he said hurriedly she must be an accomplice and will lead me to him wait up for me the hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before holmes had descended the stair looking through the window i could see her walking feebly along the other side while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind either his whole theory is incorrect i thought to myself or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery there was no need for him to ask me to wait up for him for i felt that sleep was impossible until i heard the result of his adventure  it was close upon nine when he set out i had no idea how long he might be but i sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of henri murgers vie de bohème ten oclock passed and i heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed eleven and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door bound for the same destination it was close upon twelve before i heard the sharp sound of his latchkey the instant he entered i saw by his face that he had not been successful amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery until the former suddenly carried the day and he burst into a hearty laugh  i wouldnt have the scotland yarders know it for the world he cried dropping into his chair i have chaffed them so much that they would never have let me hear the end of it i can afford to laugh because i know that i will be even with them in the long run  what is it then i asked  oh i dont mind telling a story against myself that creature had gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being footsore presently she came to a halt and hailed a fourwheeler which was passing i managed to be close to her so as to hear the address but i need not have been so anxious for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street drive to 13 duncan street houndsditch she cried this begins to look genuine i thought and having seen her safely inside i perched myself behind thats an art which every detective should be an expert at well away we rattled and never drew rein until we reached the street in question i hopped off before we came to the door and strolled down the street in an easy lounging way i saw the cab pull up the driver jumped down and i saw him open the door and stand expectantly nothing came out though when i reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever i listened to there was no sign or trace of his passenger and i fear it will be some time before he gets his fare on inquiring at number 13 we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger named keswick and that no one of the name either of sawyer or dennis had ever been heard of there  you dont mean to say i cried in amazement that that tottering feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion without either you or the driver seeing her  old woman be damned said sherlock holmes sharply we were the old women to be so taken in it must have been a young man and an active one too besides being an incomparable actor the getup was inimitable he saw that he was followed no doubt and used this means of giving me the slip it shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as i imagined he was but has friends who are ready to risk something for him now doctor you are looking doneup take my advice and turn in  i was certainly feeling very weary so i obeyed his injunction i left holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire and long into the watches of the night i heard the low melancholy wailings of his violin and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel     chapter vi tobias gregson shows what he can do   the papers next day were full of the brixton mystery as they termed it each had a long account of the affair and some had leaders upon it in addition there was some information in them which was new to me i still retain in my scrapbook numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the case here is a condensation of a few of them   the daily telegraph remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features the german name of the victim the absence of all other motive and the sinister inscription on the wall all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists the socialists had many branches in america and the deceased had no doubt infringed their unwritten laws and been tracked down by them after alluding airily to the vehmgericht aqua tofana carbonari the marchioness de brinvilliers the darwinian theory the principles of malthus and the ratcliff highway murders the article concluded by admonishing the government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in england  the standard commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a liberal administration they arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses and the consequent weakening of all authority the deceased was an american gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the metropolis he had stayed at the boardinghouse of madame charpentier in torquay terrace camberwell he was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary mr joseph stangerson the two bade adieu to their landlady upon tuesday the 4th inst and departed to euston station with the avowed intention of catching the liverpool express they were afterwards seen together upon the platform nothing more is known of them until mr drebbers body was as recorded discovered in an empty house in the brixton road many miles from euston how he came there or how he met his fate are questions which are still involved in mystery nothing is known of the whereabouts of stangerson we are glad to learn that mr lestrade and mr gregson of scotland yard are both engaged upon the case and it is confidently anticipated that these wellknown officers will speedily throw light upon the matter  the daily news observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one the despotism and hatred of liberalism which animated the continental governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone among these men there was a stringent code of honour any infringement of which was punished by death every effort should be made to find the secretary stangerson and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased a great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had boardeda result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of mr gregson of scotland yard  sherlock holmes and i read these notices over together at breakfast and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement  i told you that whatever happened lestrade and gregson would be sure to score  that depends on how it turns out  oh bless you it doesnt matter in the least if the man is caught it will be on account of their exertions if he escapes it will be in spite of their exertions its heads i win and tails you lose whatever they do they will have followers un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui ladmire  what on earth is this i cried for at this moment there came the pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs accompanied by audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady  its the baker street division of the detective police force said my companion gravely and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street arabs that ever i clapped eyes on  tention cried holmes in a sharp tone and the six dirty little scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes in future you shall send up wiggins alone to report and the rest of you must wait in the street have you found it wiggins  no sir we haint said one of the youths  i hardly expected you would you must keep on until you do here are your wages he handed each of them a shilling  now off you go and come back with a better report next time  he waved his hand and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street  theres more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force holmes remarked the mere sight of an officiallooking person seals mens lips these youngsters however go everywhere and hear everything they are as sharp as needles too all they want is organisation  is it on this brixton case that you are employing them i asked  yes there is a point which i wish to ascertain it is merely a matter of time hullo we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance here is gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face bound for us i know yes he is stopping there he is  there was a violent peal at the bell and in a few seconds the fairhaired detective came up the stairs three steps at a time and burst into our sittingroom  my dear fellow he cried wringing holmes unresponsive hand congratulate me i have made the whole thing as clear as day  a shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companions expressive face  do you mean that you are on the right track he asked  the right track why sir we have the man under lock and key  and his name is  arthur charpentier sublieutenant in her majestys navy cried gregson pompously rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest  sherlock holmes gave a sigh of relief and relaxed into a smile  take a seat and try one of these cigars he said we are anxious to know how you managed it will you have some whiskey and water  i dont mind if i do the detective answered the tremendous exertions which i have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out not so much bodily exertion you understand as the strain upon the mind you will appreciate that mr sherlock holmes for we are both brainworkers  you do me too much honour said holmes gravely let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result  the detective seated himself in the armchair and puffed complacently at his cigar then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement  the fun of it is he cried that that fool lestrade who thinks himself so smart has gone off upon the wrong track altogether he is after the secretary stangerson who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn i have no doubt that he has caught him by this time  the idea tickled gregson so much that he laughed until he choked  and how did you get your clue  ah ill tell you all about it of course doctor watson this is strictly between ourselves the first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this americans antecedents some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered or until parties came forward and volunteered information that is not tobias gregsons way of going to work you remember the hat beside the dead man  yes said holmes by john underwood and sons 129 camberwell road  gregson looked quite crestfallen  i had no idea that you noticed that he said have you been there  no  ha cried gregson in a relieved voice you should never neglect a chance however small it may seem  to a great mind nothing is little remarked holmes sententiously  well i went to underwood and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description he looked over his books and came on it at once he had sent the hat to a mr drebber residing at charpentiers boarding establishment torquay terrace thus i got at his address  smartvery smart murmured sherlock holmes  i next called upon madame charpentier continued the detective i found her very pale and distressed her daughter was in the room tooan uncommonly fine girl she is too she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as i spoke to her that didnt escape my notice i began to smell a rat you know the feeling mr sherlock holmes when you come upon the right scenta kind of thrill in your nerves have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder mr enoch j drebber of cleveland i asked  the mother nodded she didnt seem able to get out a word the daughter burst into tears i felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter  at what oclock did mr drebber leave your house for the train i asked  at eight oclock she said gulping in her throat to keep down her agitation his secretary mr stangerson said that there were two trainsone at 915 and one at 11 he was to catch the first  and was that the last which you saw of him  a terrible change came over the womans face as i asked the question her features turned perfectly livid it was some seconds before she could get out the single word yesand when it did come it was in a husky unnatural tone  there was silence for a moment and then the daughter spoke in a calm clear voice  no good can ever come of falsehood mother she said let us be frank with this gentleman we did see mr drebber again  god forgive you cried madame charpentier throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair you have murdered your brother  arthur would rather that we spoke the truth the girl answered firmly  you had best tell me all about it now i said halfconfidences are worse than none besides you do not know how much we know of it  on your head be it alice cried her mother and then turning to me i will tell you all sir do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair he is utterly innocent of it my dread is however that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised that however is surely impossible his high character his profession his antecedents would all forbid it  your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts i answered depend upon it if your son is innocent he will be none the worse  perhaps alice you had better leave us together she said and her daughter withdrew now sir she continued i had no intention of telling you all this but since my poor daughter has disclosed it i have no alternative having once decided to speak i will tell you all without omitting any particular  it is your wisest course said i  mr drebber has been with us nearly three weeks he and his secretary mr stangerson had been travelling on the continent i noticed a copenhagen label upon each of their trunks showing that that had been their last stopping place stangerson was a quiet reserved man but his employer i am sorry to say was far otherwise he was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways the very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink and indeed after twelve oclock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober his manners towards the maidservants were disgustingly free and familiar worst of all he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter alice and spoke to her more than once in a way which fortunately she is too innocent to understand on one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced heran outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct  but why did you stand all this i asked i suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish  mrs charpentier blushed at my pertinent question would to god that i had given him notice on the very day that he came she said but it was a sore temptation they were paying a pound a day eachfourteen pounds a week and this is the slack season i am a widow and my boy in the navy has cost me much i grudged to lose the money i acted for the best this last was too much however and i gave him notice to leave on account of it that was the reason of his going  well  my heart grew light when i saw him drive away my son is on leave just now but i did not tell him anything of all this for his temper is violent and he is passionately fond of his sister when i closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind alas in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell and i learned that mr drebber had returned he was much excited and evidently the worse for drink he forced his way into the room where i was sitting with my daughter and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train he then turned to alice and before my very face proposed to her that she should fly with him you are of age he said and there is no law to stop you i have money enough and to spare never mind the old girl here but come along with me now straight away you shall live like a princess poor alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door i screamed and at that moment my son arthur came into the room what happened then i do not know i heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle i was too terrified to raise my head when i did look up i saw arthur standing in the doorway laughing with a stick in his hand i dont think that fine fellow will trouble us again he said i will just go after him and see what he does with himself with those words he took his hat and started off down the street the next morning we heard of mr drebbers mysterious death  this statement came from mrs charpentiers lips with many gasps and pauses at times she spoke so low that i could hardly catch the words i made shorthand notes of all that she said however so that there should be no possibility of a mistake  its quite exciting said sherlock holmes with a yawn what happened next  when mrs charpentier paused the detective continued i saw that the whole case hung upon one point fixing her with my eye in a way which i always found effective with women i asked her at what hour her son returned  i do not know she answered  not know  no he has a latchkey and he let himself in  after you went to bed  yes  when did you go to bed  about eleven  so your son was gone at least two hours  yes  possibly four or five  yes  what was he doing during that time  i do not know she answered turning white to her very lips  of course after that there was nothing more to be done i found out where lieutenant charpentier was took two officers with me and arrested him when i touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us he answered us as bold as brass i suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel drebber he said we had said nothing to him about it so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect  very said holmes  he still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed drebber it was a stout oak cudgel  what is your theory then  well my theory is that he followed drebber as far as the brixton road when there a fresh altercation arose between them in the course of which drebber received a blow from the stick in the pit of the stomach perhaps which killed him without leaving any mark the night was so wet that no one was about so charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house as to the candle and the blood and the writing on the wall and the ring they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent  well done said holmes in an encouraging voice really gregson you are getting along we shall make something of you yet  i flatter myself that i have managed it rather neatly the detective answered proudly the young man volunteered a statement in which he said that after following drebber some time the latter perceived him and took a cab in order to get away from him on his way home he met an old shipmate and took a long walk with him on being asked where this old shipmate lived he was unable to give any satisfactory reply i think the whole case fits together uncommonly well what amuses me is to think of lestrade who had started off upon the wrong scent i am afraid he wont make much of it why by jove heres the very man himself  it was indeed lestrade who had ascended the stairs while we were talking and who now entered the room the assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his demeanour and dress were however wanting his face was disturbed and troubled while his clothes were disarranged and untidy he had evidently come with the intention of consulting with sherlock holmes for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out he stood in the centre of the room fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do this is a most extraordinary case he said at lasta most incomprehensible affair  ah you find it so mr lestrade cried gregson triumphantly i thought you would come to that conclusion have you managed to find the secretary mr joseph stangerson  the secretary mr joseph stangerson said lestrade gravely was murdered at hallidays private hotel about six oclock this morning     chapter vii light in the darkness   the intelligence with which lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so unexpected that we were all three fairly dumfoundered gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water i stared in silence at sherlock holmes whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes  stangerson too he muttered the plot thickens  it was quite thick enough before grumbled lestrade taking a chair i seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war  are youare you sure of this piece of intelligence stammered gregson  i have just come from his room said lestrade i was the first to discover what had occurred  we have been hearing gregsons view of the matter holmes observed would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done  i have no objection lestrade answered seating himself i freely confess that i was of the opinion that stangerson was concerned in the death of drebber this fresh development has shown me that i was completely mistaken full of the one idea i set myself to find out what had become of the secretary they had been seen together at euston station about halfpast eight on the evening of the third at two in the morning drebber had been found in the brixton road the question which confronted me was to find out how stangerson had been employed between 830 and the time of the crime and what had become of him afterwards i telegraphed to liverpool giving a description of the man and warning them to keep a watch upon the american boats i then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodginghouses in the vicinity of euston you see i argued that if drebber and his companion had become separated the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night and then to hang about the station again next morning  they would be likely to agree on some meetingplace beforehand remarked holmes  so it proved i spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail this morning i began very early and at eight oclock i reached hallidays private hotel in little george street on my enquiry as to whether a mr stangerson was living there they at once answered me in the affirmative  no doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting they said he has been waiting for a gentleman for two days  where is he now i asked  he is upstairs in bed he wished to be called at nine  i will go up and see him at once i said  it seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded the boots volunteered to show me the room  it was on the second floor and there was a small corridor leading up to it the boots pointed out the door to me and was about to go downstairs again when i saw something that made me feel sickish in spite of my twenty years experience from under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side i gave a cry which brought the boots back he nearly fainted when he saw it the door was locked on the inside but we put our shoulders to it and knocked it in the window of the room was open and beside the window all huddled up lay the body of a man in his nightdress he was quite dead and had been for some time for his limbs were rigid and cold when we turned him over the boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of joseph stangerson the cause of death was a deep stab in the left side which must have penetrated the heart and now comes the strangest part of the affair what do you suppose was above the murdered man  i felt a creeping of the flesh and a presentiment of coming horror even before sherlock holmes answered  the word rache written in letters of blood he said  that was it said lestrade in an awestruck voice and we were all silent for a while  there was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes my nerves which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as i thought of it  the man was seen continued lestrade a milk boy passing on his way to the dairy happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel he noticed that a ladder which usually lay there was raised against one of the windows of the second floor which was wide open after passing he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder he came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel he took no particular notice of him beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work he has an impression that the man was tall had a reddish face and was dressed in a long brownish coat he must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder for we found bloodstained water in the basin where he had washed his hands and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife  i glanced at holmes on hearing the description of the murderer which tallied so exactly with his own there was however no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face  did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer he asked  nothing stangerson had drebbers purse in his pocket but it seems that this was usual as he did all the paying there was eighty odd pounds in it but nothing had been taken whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes robbery is certainly not one of them there were no papers or memoranda in the murdered mans pocket except a single telegram dated from cleveland about a month ago and containing the words j h is in europe there was no name appended to this message  and there was nothing else holmes asked  nothing of any importance the mans novel with which he had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed and his pipe was on a chair beside him there was a glass of water on the table and on the windowsill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills  sherlock holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight  the last link he cried exultantly my case is complete  the two detectives stared at him in amazement  i have now in my hands my companion said confidently all the threads which have formed such a tangle there are of course details to be filled in but i am as certain of all the main facts from the time that drebber parted from stangerson at the station up to the discovery of the body of the latter as if i had seen them with my own eyes i will give you a proof of my knowledge could you lay your hand upon those pills  i have them said lestrade producing a small white box i took them and the purse and the telegram intending to have them put in a place of safety at the police station it was the merest chance my taking these pills for i am bound to say that i do not attach any importance to them  give them here said holmes now doctor turning to me are those ordinary pills  they certainly were not they were of a pearly grey colour small round and almost transparent against the light from their lightness and transparency i should imagine that they are soluble in water i remarked  precisely so answered holmes now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday  i went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms its laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end indeed its snowwhite muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence i placed it upon a cushion on the rug  i will now cut one of these pills in two said holmes and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word one half we return into the box for future purposes the other half i will place in this wine glass in which is a teaspoonful of water you perceive that our friend the doctor is right and that it readily dissolves  this may be very interesting said lestrade in the injured tone of one who suspects that he is being laughed at i cannot see however what it has to do with the death of mr joseph stangerson  patience my friend patience you will find in time that it has everything to do with it i shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough  as he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier who speedily licked it dry sherlock holmes earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence watching the animal intently and expecting some startling effect none such appeared however the dog continued to lie stretched upon the cushion breathing in a laboured way but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught  holmes had taken out his watch and as minute followed minute without result an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features he gnawed his lip drummed his fingers upon the table and showed every other symptom of acute impatience so great was his emotion that i felt sincerely sorry for him while the two detectives smiled derisively by no means displeased at this check which he had met  it cant be a coincidence he cried at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence the very pills which i suspected in the case of drebber are actually found after the death of stangerson and yet they are inert what can it mean surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false it is impossible and yet this wretched dog is none the worse ah i have it i have it with a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box cut the other pill in two dissolved it added milk and presented it to the terrier the unfortunate creatures tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning  sherlock holmes drew a long breath and wiped the perspiration from his forehead i should have more faith he said i ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison and the other was entirely harmless i ought to have known that before ever i saw the box at all  this last statement appeared to me to be so startling that i could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses there was the dead dog however to prove that his conjecture had been correct it seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away and i began to have a dim vague perception of the truth  all this seems strange to you continued holmes because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you i had the good fortune to seize upon that and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition and indeed was the logical sequence of it hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions it is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery the most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn this murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those outré and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable these strange details far from making the case more difficult have really had the effect of making it less so  mr gregson who had listened to this address with considerable impatience could contain himself no longer look here mr sherlock holmes he said we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man and that you have your own methods of working we want something more than mere theory and preaching now though it is a case of taking the man i have made my case out and it seems i was wrong young charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair lestrade went after his man stangerson and it appears that he was wrong too you have thrown out hints here and hints there and seem to know more than we do but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business can you name the man who did it  i cannot help feeling that gregson is right sir remarked lestrade we have both tried and we have both failed you have remarked more than once since i have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require surely you will not withhold it any longer  any delay in arresting the assassin i observed might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity  thus pressed by us all holmes showed signs of irresolution he continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down as was his habit when lost in thought  there will be no more murders he said at last stopping abruptly and facing us you can put that consideration out of the question you have asked me if i know the name of the assassin i do the mere knowing of his name is a small thing however compared with the power of laying our hands upon him this i expect very shortly to do i have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements but it is a thing which needs delicate handling for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with who is supported as i have had occasion to prove by another who is as clever as himself as long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him but if he had the slightest suspicion he would change his name and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city without meaning to hurt either of your feelings i am bound to say that i consider these men to be more than a match for the official force and that is why i have not asked your assistance if i fail i shall of course incur all the blame due to this omission but that i am prepared for at present i am ready to promise that the instant that i can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations i shall do so  gregson and lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police the former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair while the others beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment neither of them had time to speak however before there was a tap at the door and the spokesman of the street arabs young wiggins introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person  please sir he said touching his forelock i have the cab downstairs  good boy said holmes blandly why dont you introduce this pattern at scotland yard he continued taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a drawer see how beautifully the spring works they fasten in an instant  the old pattern is good enough remarked lestrade if we can only find the man to put them on  very good very good said holmes smiling the cabman may as well help me with my boxes just ask him to step up wiggins  i was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set out on a journey since he had not said anything to me about it there was a small portmanteau in the room and this he pulled out and began to strap he was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room  just give me a help with this buckle cabman he said kneeling over his task and never turning his head  the fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen defiant air and put down his hands to assist at that instant there was a sharp click the jangling of metal and sherlock holmes sprang to his feet again  gentlemen he cried with flashing eyes let me introduce you to mr jefferson hope the murderer of enoch drebber and of joseph stangerson  the whole thing occurred in a momentso quickly that i had no time to realize it i have a vivid recollection of that instant of holmes triumphant expression and the ring of his voice of the cabmans dazed savage face as he glared at the glittering handcuffs which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists for a second or two we might have been a group of statues then with an inarticulate roar of fury the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmess grasp and hurled himself through the window woodwork and glass gave way before him but before he got quite through gregson lestrade and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds he was dragged back into the room and then commenced a terrific conflict so powerful and so fierce was he that the four of us were shaken off again and again he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and halfstrangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands that done we rose to our feet breathless and panting  we have his cab said sherlock holmes it will serve to take him to scotland yard and now gentlemen he continued with a pleasant smile we have reached the end of our little mystery you are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now and there is no danger that i will refuse to answer them     part ii the country of the saints     chapter i on the great alkali plain   in the central portion of the great north american continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilisation from the sierra nevada to nebraska and from the yellowstone river in the north to the colorado upon the south is a region of desolation and silence nor is nature always in one mood throughout this grim district it comprises snowcapped and lofty mountains and dark and gloomy valleys there are swiftflowing rivers which dash through jagged cañons and there are enormous plains which in winter are white with snow and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust they all preserve however the common characteristics of barrenness inhospitality and misery  there are no inhabitants of this land of despair a band of pawnees or of blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other huntinggrounds but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains and to find themselves once more upon their prairies the coyote skulks among the scrub the buzzard flaps heavily through the air and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks these are the sole dwellers in the wilderness  in the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the sierra blanco as far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plainland all dusted over with patches of alkali and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes on the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks with their rugged summits flecked with snow in this great stretch of country there is no sign of life nor of anything appertaining to life there is no bird in the steelblue heaven no movement upon the dull grey earthabove all there is absolute silence listen as one may there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness nothing but silencecomplete and heartsubduing silence  it has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain that is hardly true looking down from the sierra blanco one sees a pathway traced out across the desert which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance it is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali approach and examine them they are bones  some large and coarse others smaller and more delicate the former have belonged to oxen and the latter to men for fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside  looking down on this very scene there stood upon the fourth of may eighteen hundred and fortyseven a solitary traveller his appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region an observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty his face was lean and haggard and the brown parchmentlike skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones his long brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white his eyes were sunken in his head and burned with an unnatural lustre while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton as he stood he leaned upon his weapon for support and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution his gaunt face however and his clothes which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance the man was dyingdying from hunger and from thirst  he had toiled painfully down the ravine and on to this little elevation in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes and the distant belt of savage mountains without a sign anywhere of plant or tree which might indicate the presence of moisture in all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope north and east and west he looked with wild questioning eyes and then he realised that his wanderings had come to an end and that there on that barren crag he was about to die why not here as well as in a feather bed twenty years hence he muttered as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder  before sitting down he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl which he had carried slung over his right shoulder it appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength for in lowering it it came down on the ground with some little violence instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry and from it there protruded a small scared face with very bright brown eyes and two little speckled dimpled fists  youve hurt me said a childish voice reproachfully  have i though the man answered penitently i didnt go for to do it as he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of about five years of age whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mothers care the child was pale and wan but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion  how is it now he answered anxiously for she was still rubbing the towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head  kiss it and make it well she said with perfect gravity showing the injured part up to him thats what mother used to do wheres mother  mothers gone i guess youll see her before long  gone eh said the little girl funny she didnt say goodbye she most always did if she was just goin over to aunties for tea and now shes been away three days say its awful dry aint it aint there no water nor nothing to eat  no there aint nothing dearie youll just need to be patient awhile and then youll be all right put your head up agin me like that and then youll feel bullier it aint easy to talk when your lips is like leather but i guess id best let you know how the cards lie whats that youve got  pretty things fine things cried the little girl enthusiastically holding up two glittering fragments of mica when we goes back to home ill give them to brother bob  youll see prettier things than them soon said the man confidently you just wait a bit i was going to tell you thoughyou remember when we left the river  oh yes  well we reckoned wed strike another river soon dye see but there was somethin wrong compasses or map or somethin and it didnt turn up water ran out just except a little drop for the likes of you andand  and you couldnt wash yourself interrupted his companion gravely staring up at his grimy visage  no nor drink and mr bender he was the fust to go and then indian pete and then mrs mcgregor and then johnny hones and then dearie your mother  then mothers a deader too cried the little girl dropping her face in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly  yes they all went except you and me then i thought there was some chance of water in this direction so i heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together it dont seem as though weve improved matters theres an almighty small chance for us now  do you mean that we are going to die too asked the child checking her sobs and raising her tearstained face  i guess thats about the size of it  why didnt you say so before she said laughing gleefully you gave me such a fright why of course now as long as we die well be with mother again  yes you will dearie  and you too ill tell her how awful good youve been ill bet she meets us at the door of heaven with a big pitcher of water and a lot of buckwheat cakes hot and toasted on both sides like bob and me was fond of how long will it be first  i dont knownot very long the mans eyes were fixed upon the northern horizon in the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment so rapidly did they approach they speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds which circled over the heads of the two wanderers and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them they were buzzards the vultures of the west whose coming is the forerunner of death  cocks and hens cried the little girl gleefully pointing at their illomened forms and clapping her hands to make them rise say did god make this country  in course he did said her companion rather startled by this unexpected question  he made the country down in illinois and he made the missouri the little girl continued i guess somebody else made the country in these parts its not nearly so well done they forgot the water and the trees  what would ye think of offering up prayer the man asked diffidently  it aint night yet she answered  it dont matter it aint quite regular but he wont mind that you bet you say over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was on the plains  why dont you say some yourself the child asked with wondering eyes  i disremember them he answered i haint said none since i was half the height o that gun i guess its never too late you say them out and ill stand by and come in on the choruses  then youll need to kneel down and me too she said laying the shawl out for that purpose youve got to put your hands up like this it makes you feel kind o good  it was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see it side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers the little prattling child and the reckless hardened adventurer her chubby face and his haggard angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were face to face while the two voicesthe one thin and clear the other deep and harshunited in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness the prayer finished they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep nestling upon the broad breast of her protector he watched over her slumber for some time but nature proved to be too strong for him for three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast until the mans grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber  had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his eyes far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust very slight at first and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid welldefined cloud this cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures in more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him this was obviously impossible in these arid wilds as the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing the canvascovered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the west but what a caravan when the head of it had reached the base of the mountains the rear was not yet visible on the horizon right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array waggons and carts men on horseback and men on foot innumerable women who staggered along under burdens and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings this was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country there rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses loud as it was it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them  at the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles on reaching the base of the bluff they halted and held a short council among themselves  the wells are to the right my brothers said one a hardlipped cleanshaven man with grizzly hair  to the right of the sierra blancoso we shall reach the rio grande said another  fear not for water cried a third he who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon his own chosen people  amen amen responded the whole party  they were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and keenesteyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag above them from its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind at the sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard the word redskins was on every lip  there cant be any number of injuns here said the elderly man who appeared to be in command we have passed the pawnees and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains  shall i go forward and see brother stangerson asked one of the band  and i and i cried a dozen voices  leave your horses below and we will await you here the elder answered in a moment the young fellows had dismounted fastened their horses and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity they advanced rapidly and noiselessly with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts the watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline the young man who had first given the alarm was leading them suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands as though overcome with astonishment and on joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their eyes  on the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder and against this boulder there lay a tall man longbearded and hardfeatured but of an excessive thinness his placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep beside him lay a little child with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic her rosy lips were parted showing the regular line of snowwhite teeth within and a playful smile played over her infantile features her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion on the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards who at the sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away  the cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about them in bewilderment the man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts his face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed and he passed his boney hand over his eyes this is what they call delirium i guess he muttered the child stood beside him holding on to the skirt of his coat and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood  the rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their appearance was no delusion one of them seized the little girl and hoisted her upon his shoulder while two others supported her gaunt companion and assisted him towards the waggons  my name is john ferrier the wanderer explained me and that little un are all thats left o twentyone people the rest is all dead o thirst and hunger away down in the south  is she your child asked someone  i guess she is now the other cried defiantly shes mine cause i saved her no man will take her from me shes lucy ferrier from this day on who are you though he continued glancing with curiosity at his stalwart sunburned rescuers there seems to be a powerful lot of ye  nigh upon ten thousand said one of the young men we are the persecuted children of godthe chosen of the angel merona  i never heard tell on him said the wanderer he appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye  do not jest at that which is sacred said the other sternly we are of those who believe in those sacred writings drawn in egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold which were handed unto the holy joseph smith at palmyra we have come from nauvoo in the state of illinois where we had founded our temple we have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless even though it be the heart of the desert  the name of nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to john ferrier i see he said you are the mormons  we are the mormons answered his companions with one voice  and where are you going  we do not know the hand of god is leading us under the person of our prophet you must come before him he shall say what is to be done with you  they had reached the base of the hill by this time and were surrounded by crowds of the pilgrimspalefaced meeklooking women strong laughing children and anxious earnesteyed men many were the cries of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the other their escort did not halt however but pushed on followed by a great crowd of mormons until they reached a waggon which was conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance six horses were yoked to it whereas the others were furnished with two or at most four apiece beside the driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader he was reading a brownbacked volume but as the crowd approached he laid it aside and listened attentively to an account of the episode then he turned to the two castaways  if we take you with us he said in solemn words it can only be as believers in our own creed we shall have no wolves in our fold better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit will you come with us on these terms  guess ill come with you on any terms said ferrier with such emphasis that the grave elders could not restrain a smile the leader alone retained his stern impressive expression  take him brother stangerson he said give him food and drink and the child likewise let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed we have delayed long enough forward on on to zion  on on to zion cried the crowd of mormons and the words rippled down the long caravan passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur in the far distance with a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more the elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed led them to his waggon where a meal was already awaiting them  you shall remain here he said in a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues in the meantime remember that now and for ever you are of our religion brigham young has said it and he has spoken with the voice of joseph smith which is the voice of god     chapter ii the flower of utah   this is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by the immigrant mormons before they came to their final haven from the shores of the mississippi to the western slopes of the rocky mountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history the savage man and the savage beast hunger thirst fatigue and diseaseevery impediment which nature could place in the way had all been overcome with anglosaxon tenacity yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them there was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore  young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute chief maps were drawn and charts prepared in which the future city was sketched out all around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual the tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling in the town streets and squares sprang up as if by magic in the country there was draining and hedging planting and clearing until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop everything prospered in the strange settlement above all the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger from the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to him who had led them safe through many dangers  the two castaways john ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter accompanied the mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage little lucy ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in elder stangersons waggon a retreat which she shared with the mormons three wives and with his son a headstrong forward boy of twelve having rallied with the elasticity of childhood from the shock caused by her mothers death she soon became a pet with the women and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvascovered home in the meantime ferrier having recovered from his privations distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter so rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions that when they reached the end of their wanderings it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers with the exception of young himself and of stangerson kemball johnston and drebber who were the four principal elders  on the farm thus acquired john ferrier built himself a substantial loghouse which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa he was a man of a practical turn of mind keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands his iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly in three years he was better off than his neighbours in six he was welltodo in nine he was rich and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of salt lake city who could compare with him from the great inland sea to the distant wahsatch mountains there was no name better known than that of john ferrier  there was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his coreligionists no argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions he never gave reasons for this persistent refusal but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination there were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense others again spoke of some early love affair and of a fairhaired girl who had pined away on the shores of the atlantic whatever the reason ferrier remained strictly celibate in every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement and gained the name of being an orthodox and straightwalking man  lucy ferrier grew up within the loghouse and assisted her adopted father in all his undertakings the keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl as year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger her cheek more rudy and her step more elastic many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by ferriers farm felt longforgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields or met her mounted upon her fathers mustang and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the west so the bud blossomed into a flower and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of american girlhood as could be found in the whole pacific slope  it was not the father however who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman it seldom is in such cases that mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her and she learns with a mixture of pride and of fear that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her there are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life in the case of lucy ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides  it was a warm june morning and the latter day saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem in the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavilyladen mules all heading to the west for the gold fever had broken out in california and the overland route lay through the city of the elect there too were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands and trains of tired immigrants men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey through all this motley assemblage threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider there galloped lucy ferrier her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her she had a commission from her father in the city and was dashing in as she had done many a time before with all the fearlessness of youth thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed the travelstained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment and even the unemotional indians journeying in with their pelties relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the palefaced maiden  she had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle driven by a halfdozen wildlooking herdsmen from the plains in her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap scarcely had she got fairly into it however before the beasts closed in behind her and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierceeyed longhorned bullocks accustomed as she was to deal with cattle she was not alarmed at her situation but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures either by accident or design came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang and excited it to madness in an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider the situation was full of peril every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again and goaded it to fresh madness it was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals unaccustomed to sudden emergencies her head began to swim and her grip upon the bridle to relax choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures she might have abandoned her efforts in despair but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance at the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb and forcing a way through the drove soon brought her to the outskirts  youre not hurt i hope miss said her preserver respectfully  she looked up at his dark fierce face and laughed saucily im awful frightened she said naively whoever would have thought that poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows  thank god you kept your seat the other said earnestly he was a tall savagelooking young fellow mounted on a powerful roan horse and clad in the rough dress of a hunter with a long rifle slung over his shoulders i guess you are the daughter of john ferrier he remarked i saw you ride down from his house when you see him ask him if he remembers the jefferson hopes of st louis if hes the same ferrier my father and he were pretty thick  hadnt you better come and ask yourself she asked demurely  the young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure ill do so he said weve been in the mountains for two months and are not over and above in visiting condition he must take us as he finds us  he has a good deal to thank you for and so have i she answered hes awful fond of me if those cows had jumped on me hed have never got over it  neither would i said her companion  you well i dont see that it would make much matter to you anyhow you aint even a friend of ours  the young hunters dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that lucy ferrier laughed aloud  there i didnt mean that she said of course you are a friend now you must come and see us now i must push along or father wont trust me with his business any more goodbye  goodbye he answered raising his broad sombrero and bending over her little hand she wheeled her mustang round gave it a cut with her ridingwhip and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust  young jefferson hope rode on with his companions gloomy and taciturn he and they had been among the nevada mountains prospecting for silver and were returning to salt lake city in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered he had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel the sight of the fair young girl as frank and wholesome as the sierra breezes had stirred his volcanic untamed heart to its very depths when she had vanished from his sight he realized that a crisis had come in his life and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and allabsorbing one the love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden changeable fancy of a boy but rather the wild fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper he had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook he swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him successful  he called on john ferrier that night and many times again until his face was a familiar one at the farmhouse john cooped up in the valley and absorbed in his work had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years all this jefferson hope was able to tell him and in a style which interested lucy as well as her father he had been a pioneer in california and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild halcyon days he had been a scout too and a trapper a silver explorer and a ranchman wherever stirring adventures were to be had jefferson hope had been there in search of them he soon became a favourite with the old farmer who spoke eloquently of his virtues on such occasions lucy was silent but her blushing cheek and her bright happy eyes showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own her honest father may not have observed these symptoms but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections  it was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate she was at the doorway and came down to meet him he threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway  i am off lucy he said taking her two hands in his and gazing tenderly down into her face i wont ask you to come with me now but will you be ready to come when i am here again  and when will that be she asked blushing and laughing  a couple of months at the outside i will come and claim you then my darling theres no one who can stand between us  and how about father she asked  he has given his consent provided we get these mines working all right i have no fear on that head  oh well of course if you and father have arranged it all theres no more to be said she whispered with her cheek against his broad breast  thank god he said hoarsely stooping and kissing her it is settled then the longer i stay the harder it will be to go they are waiting for me at the cañon goodbye my own darlinggoodbye in two months you shall see me  he tore himself from her as he spoke and flinging himself upon his horse galloped furiously away never even looking round as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving she stood at the gate gazing after him until he vanished from her sight then she walked back into the house the happiest girl in all utah     chapter iii john ferrier talks with the prophet   three weeks had passed since jefferson hope and his comrades had departed from salt lake city john ferriers heart was sore within him when he thought of the young mans return and of the impending loss of his adopted child yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done he had always determined deep down in his resolute heart that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a mormon such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all but as a shame and a disgrace whatever he might think of the mormon doctrines upon that one point he was inflexible he had to seal his mouth on the subject however for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the land of the saints  yes a dangerous matterso dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued and bring down a swift retribution upon them the victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account and persecutors of the most terrible description not the inquisition of seville nor the german vehmgericht nor the secret societies of italy were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the state of utah  its invisibility and the mystery which was attached to it made this organization doubly terrible it appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent and yet was neither seen nor heard the man who held out against the church vanished away and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him his wife and his children awaited him at home but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges a rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them no wonder that men went about in fear and trembling and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them  at first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who having embraced the mormon faith wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it soon however it took a wider range the supply of adult women was running short and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed strange rumours began to be bandied aboutrumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where indians had never been seen fresh women appeared in the harems of the elderswomen who pined and wept and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men masked stealthy and noiseless who flitted by them in the darkness these tales and rumours took substance and shape and were corroborated and recorroborated until they resolved themselves into a definite name to this day in the lonely ranches of the west the name of the danite band or the avenging angels is a sinister and an illomened one  fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the minds of men none knew who belonged to this ruthless society the names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret the very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the prophet and his mission might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation hence every man feared his neighbour and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart  one fine morning john ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields when he heard the click of the latch and looking through the window saw a stout sandyhaired middleaged man coming up the pathway his heart leapt to his mouth for this was none other than the great brigham young himself full of trepidationfor he knew that such a visit boded him little goodferrier ran to the door to greet the mormon chief the latter however received his salutations coldly and followed him with a stern face into the sittingroom  brother ferrier he said taking a seat and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his lightcoloured eyelashes the true believers have been good friends to you we picked you up when you were starving in the desert we shared our food with you led you safe to the chosen valley gave you a goodly share of land and allowed you to wax rich under our protection is not this so  it is so answered john ferrier  in return for all this we asked but one condition  that was that you should embrace the true faith and conform in every way to its usages this you promised to do and this if common report says truly you have neglected  and how have i neglected it asked ferrier throwing out his hands in expostulation have i not given to the common fund have i not attended at the temple have i not  where are your wives asked young looking round him call them in that i may greet them  it is true that i have not married ferrier answered but women were few and there were many who had better claims than i i was not a lonely man  i had my daughter to attend to my wants  it is of that daughter that i would speak to you said the leader of the mormons she has grown to be the flower of utah and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land  john ferrier groaned internally  there are stories of her which i would fain disbelievestories that she is sealed to some gentile this must be the gossip of idle tongues what is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted joseph smith let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect for if she wed a gentile she commits a grievous sin this being so it is impossible that you who profess the holy creed should suffer your daughter to violate it  john ferrier made no answer but he played nervously with his ridingwhip  upon this one point your whole faith shall be testedso it has been decided in the sacred council of four the girl is young and we would not have her wed grey hairs neither would we deprive her of all choice we elders have many heifers but our children must also be provided stangerson has a son and drebber has a son and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house let her choose between them they are young and rich and of the true faith what say you to that      heber c kemball in one of his sermons alludes to his hundred     wives under this endearing epithet  ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted  you will give us time he said at last my daughter is very youngshe is scarce of an age to marry  she shall have a month to choose said young rising from his seat at the end of that time she shall give her answer  he was passing through the door when he turned with flushed face and flashing eyes it were better for you john ferrier he thundered that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the sierra blanco than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the holy four  with a threatening gesture of his hand he turned from the door and ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path  he was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his and looking up he saw her standing beside him one glance at her pale frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed  i could not help it she said in answer to his look his voice rang through the house oh father father what shall we do  dont you scare yourself he answered drawing her to him and passing his broad rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair well fix it up somehow or another you dont find your fancy kind o lessening for this chap do you  a sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer  no of course not i shouldnt care to hear you say you did hes a likely lad and hes a christian which is more than these folk here in spite o all their praying and preaching theres a party starting for nevada tomorrow and ill manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in if i know anything o that young man hell be back here with a speed that would whip electrotelegraphs  lucy laughed through her tears at her fathers description  when he comes he will advise us for the best but it is for you that i am frightened dear one hearsone hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the prophet  something terrible always happens to them  but we havent opposed him yet her father answered it will be time to look out for squalls when we do we have a clear month before us at the end of that i guess we had best shin out of utah  leave utah  thats about the size of it  but the farm  we will raise as much as we can in money and let the rest go to tell the truth lucy it isnt the first time i have thought of doing it i dont care about knuckling under to any man as these folk do to their darned prophet im a freeborn american and its all new to me guess im too old to learn if he comes browsing about this farm he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction  but they wont let us leave his daughter objected  wait till jefferson comes and well soon manage that in the meantime dont you fret yourself my dearie and dont get your eyes swelled up else hell be walking into me when he sees you theres nothing to be afeared about and theres no danger at all  john ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom     chapter iv a flight for life   on the morning which followed his interview with the mormon prophet john ferrier went in to salt lake city and having found his acquaintance who was bound for the nevada mountains he entrusted him with his message to jefferson hope in it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them and how necessary it was that he should return having done thus he felt easier in his mind and returned home with a lighter heart  as he approached his farm he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate still more surprised was he on entering to find two young men in possession of his sittingroom one with a long pale face was leaning back in the rockingchair with his feet cocked up upon the stove the other a bullnecked youth with coarse bloated features was standing in front of the window with his hands in his pocket whistling a popular hymn both of them nodded to ferrier as he entered and the one in the rockingchair commenced the conversation  maybe you dont know us he said this here is the son of elder drebber and im joseph stangerson who travelled with you in the desert when the lord stretched out his hand and gathered you into the true fold  as he will all the nations in his own good time said the other in a nasal voice he grindeth slowly but exceeding small  john ferrier bowed coldly he had guessed who his visitors were  we have come continued stangerson at the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her as i have but four wives and brother drebber here has seven it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one  nay nay brother stangerson cried the other the question is not how many wives we have but how many we can keep my father has now given over his mills to me and i am the richer man  but my prospects are better said the other warmly when the lord removes my father i shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory then i am your elder and am higher in the church  it will be for the maiden to decide rejoined young drebber smirking at his own reflection in the glass we will leave it all to her decision  during this dialogue john ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway hardly able to keep his ridingwhip from the backs of his two visitors  look here he said at last striding up to them when my daughter summons you you can come but until then i dont want to see your faces again  the two young mormons stared at him in amazement in their eyes this competition between them for the maidens hand was the highest of honours both to her and her father  there are two ways out of the room cried ferrier there is the door and there is the window which do you care to use  his brown face looked so savage and his gaunt hands so threatening that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat the old farmer followed them to the door  let me know when you have settled which it is to be he said sardonically  you shall smart for this stangerson cried white with rage you have defied the prophet and the council of four you shall rue it to the end of your days  the hand of the lord shall be heavy upon you cried young drebber he will arise and smite you  then ill start the smiting exclaimed ferrier furiously and would have rushed upstairs for his gun had not lucy seized him by the arm and restrained him before he could escape from her the clatter of horses hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach  the young canting rascals he exclaimed wiping the perspiration from his forehead i would sooner see you in your grave my girl than the wife of either of them  and so should i father she answered with spirit but jefferson will soon be here  yes it will not be long before he comes the sooner the better for we do not know what their next move may be  it was indeed high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter in the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the elders if minor errors were punished so sternly what would be the fate of this arch rebel ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now and their goods given over to the church he was a brave man but he trembled at the vague shadowy terrors which hung over him any known danger he could face with a firm lip but this suspense was unnerving he concealed his fears from his daughter however and affected to make light of the whole matter though she with the keen eye of love saw plainly that he was ill at ease  he expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from young as to his conduct and he was not mistaken though it came in an unlookedfor manner upon rising next morning he found to his surprise a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest on it was printed in bold straggling letters   twentynine days are given you for amendment and then  the dash was more fearinspiring than any threat could have been how this warning came into his room puzzled john ferrier sorely for his servants slept in an outhouse and the doors and windows had all been secured he crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter but the incident struck a chill into his heart the twentynine days were evidently the balance of the month which young had promised what strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers the hand which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart and he could never have known who had slain him  still more shaken was he next morning they had sat down to their breakfast when lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards in the centre of the ceiling was scrawled with a burned stick apparently the number 28 to his daughter it was unintelligible and he did not enlighten her that night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward he saw and he heard nothing and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door  thus day followed day and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls sometimes upon the floors occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings with all his vigilance john ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded a horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them he became haggard and restless and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature he had but one hope in life now and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from nevada  twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten but there was no news of the absentee one by one the numbers dwindled down and still there came no sign of him whenever a horseman clattered down the road or a driver shouted at his team the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last at last when he saw five give way to four and that again to three he lost heart and abandoned all hope of escape singlehanded and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement he knew that he was powerless the morefrequented roads were strictly watched and guarded and none could pass along them without an order from the council turn which way he would there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughters dishonour  he was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles and searching vainly for some way out of them that morning had shown the figure 2 upon the wall of his house and the next day would be the last of the allotted time what was to happen then all manner of vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination and his daughterwhat was to become of her after he was gone was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them he sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence  what was that in the silence he heard a gentle scratching soundlow but very distinct in the quiet of the night it came from the door of the house ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently there was a pause for a few moments and then the low insidious sound was repeated someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived john ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open  outside all was calm and quiet the night was fine and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead the little front garden lay before the farmers eyes bounded by the fence and gate but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen with a sigh of relief ferrier looked to right and to left until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground with arms and legs all asprawl  so unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out his first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent once within the house the man sprang to his feet closed the door and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of jefferson hope  good god gasped john ferrier how you scared me whatever made you come in like that  give me food the other said hoarsely i have had no time for bite or sup for eightandforty hours he flung himself upon the cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his hosts supper and devoured it voraciously does lucy bear up well he asked when he had satisfied his hunger  yes she does not know the danger her father answered  that is well the house is watched on every side that is why i crawled my way up to it they may be darned sharp but theyre not quite sharp enough to catch a washoe hunter  john ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted ally he seized the young mans leathery hand and wrung it cordially youre a man to be proud of he said there are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles  youve hit it there pard the young hunter answered i have a respect for you but if you were alone in this business id think twice before i put my head into such a hornets nest its lucy that brings me here and before harm comes on her i guess there will be one less o the hope family in utah  what are we to do  tomorrow is your last day and unless you act tonight you are lost i have a mule and two horses waiting in the eagle ravine how much money have you  two thousand dollars in gold and five in notes  that will do i have as much more to add to it we must push for carson city through the mountains you had best wake lucy it is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house  while ferrier was absent preparing his daughter for the approaching journey jefferson hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel and filled a stoneware jar with water for he knew by experience that the mountain wells were few and far between he had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start the greeting between the lovers was warm but brief for minutes were precious and there was much to be done  we must make our start at once said jefferson hope speaking in a low but resolute voice like one who realizes the greatness of the peril but has steeled his heart to meet it the front and back entrances are watched but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields once on the road we are only two miles from the ravine where the horses are waiting by daybreak we should be halfway through the mountains  what if we are stopped asked ferrier  hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic if they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us he said with a sinister smile  the lights inside the house had all been extinguished and from the darkened window ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own and which he was now about to abandon for ever he had long nerved himself to the sacrifice however and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes all looked so peaceful and happy the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grainland that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head  ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes jefferson hope had the scanty provisions and water while lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions opening the window very slowly and carefully they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night and then one by one passed through into the little garden with bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it and gained the shelter of the hedge which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields they had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow where they lay silent and trembling  it was as well that his prairie training had given jefferson hope the ears of a lynx he and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance at the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making and uttered the plaintive signal cry again on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity  tomorrow at midnight said the first who appeared to be in authority when the whippoorwill calls three times  it is well returned the other shall i tell brother drebber  pass it on to him and from him to the others nine to seven  seven to five repeated the other and the two figures flitted away in different directions their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign the instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance jefferson hope sprang to his feet and helping his companions through the gap led the way across the fields at the top of his speed supporting and halfcarrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her  hurry on hurry on he gasped from time to time we are through the line of sentinels everything depends on speed hurry on  once on the high road they made rapid progress only once did they meet anyone and then they managed to slip into a field and so avoid recognition before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness and the defile which led between them was the eagle cañon in which the horses were awaiting them with unerring instinct jefferson hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a driedup watercourse until he came to the retired corner screened with rocks where the faithful animals had been picketed the girl was placed upon the mule and old ferrier upon one of the horses with his moneybag while jefferson hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path  it was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face nature in her wildest moods on the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more black stern and menacing with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster on the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible between the two ran the irregular track so narrow in places that they had to travel in indian file and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all yet in spite of all dangers and difficulties the hearts of the fugitives were light within them for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were flying  they soon had a proof however that they were still within the jurisdiction of the saints they had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry and pointed upwards on a rock which overlooked the track showing out dark and plain against the sky there stood a solitary sentinel he saw them as soon as they perceived him and his military challenge of who goes there rang through the silent ravine  travellers for nevada said jefferson hope with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle  they could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply  by whose permission he asked  the holy four answered ferrier his mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer  nine from seven cried the sentinel  seven from five returned jefferson hope promptly remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden  pass and the lord go with you said the voice from above beyond his post the path broadened out and the horses were able to break into a trot looking back they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his gun and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen people and that freedom lay before them     chapter v the avenging angels   all night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular and rockstrewn paths more than once they lost their way but hopes intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more when morning broke a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them in every direction the great snowcapped peaks hemmed them in peeping over each others shoulders to the far horizon so steep were the rocky banks on either side of them that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them nor was the fear entirely an illusion for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner even as they passed a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges and startled the weary horses into a gallop  as the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other like lamps at a festival until they were all ruddy and glowing the magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy at a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses while they partook of a hasty breakfast lucy and her father would fain have rested longer but jefferson hope was inexorable they will be upon our track by this time he said everything depends upon our speed once safe in carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives  during the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies at nighttime they chose the base of a beetling crag where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind and there huddled together for warmth they enjoyed a few hours sleep before daybreak however they were up and on their way once more they had seen no signs of any pursuers and jefferson hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred he little knew how far that iron grasp could reach or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them  about the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out this gave the hunter little uneasiness however for there was game to be had among the mountains and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life choosing a sheltered nook he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire at which his companions might warm themselves for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level and the air was bitter and keen having tethered the horses and bade lucy adieu he threw his gun over his shoulder and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire while the three animals stood motionless in the background then the intervening rocks hid them from his view  he walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success though from the marks upon the bark of the trees and other indications he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity at last after two or three hours fruitless search he was thinking of turning back in despair when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart on the edge of a jutting pinnacle three or four hundred feet above him there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance but armed with a pair of gigantic horns the bighornfor so it is calledwas acting probably as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction and had not perceived him lying on his face he rested his rifle upon a rock and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger the animal sprang into the air tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice and then came crashing down into the valley beneath  the creature was too unwieldy to lift so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank with this trophy over his shoulder he hastened to retrace his steps for the evening was already drawing in he had hardly started however before he realized the difficulty which faced him in his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken the valley in which he found himself divided and subdivided into many gorges which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other he followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before convinced that he had taken the wrong turn he tried another but with the same result night was coming on rapidly and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track for the moon had not yet risen and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound weighed down with his burden and weary from his exertions he stumbled along keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to lucy and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey  he had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it they must he reflected be awaiting him anxiously for he had been absent nearly five hours in the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen reecho to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming he paused and listened for an answer none came save his own cry which clattered up the dreary silent ravines and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions again he shouted even louder than before and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago a vague nameless dread came over him and he hurried onwards frantically dropping the precious food in his agitation  when he turned the corner he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit there was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there but it had evidently not been tended since his departure the same dead silence still reigned all round with his fears all changed to convictions he hurried on there was no living creature near the remains of the fire  animals man maiden all were gone it was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absencea disaster which had embraced them all and yet had left no traces behind it  bewildered and stunned by this blow jefferson hope felt his head spin round and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling he was essentially a man of action however and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence seizing a halfconsumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire he blew it into a flame and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp the ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to salt lake city had they carried back both of his companions with them jefferson hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him a little way on one side of the camp was a lowlying heap of reddish soil which had assuredly not been there before there was no mistaking it for anything but a newlydug grave as the young hunter approached it he perceived that a stick had been planted on it with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it the inscription upon the paper was brief but to the point    john ferrier formerly of salt lake city died august 4th 1860   the sturdy old man whom he had left so short a time before was gone then and this was all his epitaph jefferson hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave but there was no sign of one lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny by becoming one of the harem of the elders son as the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate and his own powerlessness to prevent it he wished that he too was lying with the old farmer in his last silent restingplace  again however his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair if there was nothing else left to him he could at least devote his life to revenge with indomitable patience and perseverance jefferson hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness which he may have learned from the indians amongst whom he had lived as he stood by the desolate fire he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution brought by his own hand upon his enemies his strong will and untiring energy should he determined be devoted to that one end with a grim white face he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food and having stirred up the smouldering fire he cooked enough to last him for a few days this he made up into a bundle and tired as he was he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels  for five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback at night he flung himself down among the rocks and snatched a few hours of sleep but before daybreak he was always well on his way on the sixth day he reached the eagle cañon from which they had commenced their illfated flight thence he could look down upon the home of the saints worn and exhausted he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him as he looked at it he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets and other signs of festivity he was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horses hoofs and saw a mounted man riding towards him as he approached he recognized him as a mormon named cowper to whom he had rendered services at different times he therefore accosted him when he got up to him with the object of finding out what lucy ferriers fate had been  i am jefferson hope he said you remember me  the mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishmentindeed it was difficult to recognize in this tattered unkempt wanderer with ghastly white face and fierce wild eyes the spruce young hunter of former days having however at last satisfied himself as to his identity the mans surprise changed to consternation  you are mad to come here he cried it is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you there is a warrant against you from the holy four for assisting the ferriers away  i dont fear them or their warrant hope said earnestly you must know something of this matter cowper i conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions we have always been friends for gods sake dont refuse to answer me  what is it the mormon asked uneasily be quick the very rocks have ears and the trees eyes  what has become of lucy ferrier  she was married yesterday to young drebber hold up man hold up you have no life left in you  dont mind me said hope faintly he was white to the very lips and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning married you say  married yesterdaythats what those flags are for on the endowment house there was some words between young drebber and young stangerson as to which was to have her theyd both been in the party that followed them and stangerson had shot her father which seemed to give him the best claim but when they argued it out in council drebbers party was the stronger so the prophet gave her over to him no one wont have her very long though for i saw death in her face yesterday she is more like a ghost than a woman are you off then  yes i am off said jefferson hope who had risen from his seat his face might have been chiselled out of marble so hard and set was its expression while its eyes glowed with a baleful light  where are you going  never mind he answered and slinging his weapon over his shoulder strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself  the prediction of the mormon was only too well fulfilled whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced poor lucy never held up her head again but pined away and died within a month her sottish husband who had married her principally for the sake of john ferriers property did not affect any great grief at his bereavement but his other wives mourned over her and sat up with her the night before the burial as is the mormon custom they were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning when to their inexpressible fear and astonishment the door was flung open and a savagelooking weatherbeaten man in tattered garments strode into the room without a glance or a word to the cowering women he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of lucy ferrier stooping over her he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead and then snatching up her hand he took the weddingring from her finger she shall not be buried in that he cried with a fierce snarl and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone so strange and so brief was the episode that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared  for some months jefferson hope lingered among the mountains leading a strange wild life and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him tales were told in the city of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges once a bullet whistled through stangersons window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him on another occasion as drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face the two young mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy but always without success then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall and of having their houses guarded after a time they were able to relax these measures for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness  far from doing so it had if anything augmented it the hunters mind was of a hard unyielding nature and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion he was however above all things practical he soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out if he died like a dog among the mountains what was to become of his revenge then and yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted he felt that that was to play his enemys game so he reluctantly returned to the old nevada mines there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation  his intention had been to be absent a year at the most but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five at the end of that time however his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by john ferriers grave disguised and under an assumed name he returned to salt lake city careless what became of his own life as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice there he found evil tidings awaiting him there had been a schism among the chosen people a few months before some of the younger members of the church having rebelled against the authority of the elders and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents who had left utah and become gentiles among these had been drebber and stangerson and no one knew whither they had gone rumour reported that drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money and that he had departed a wealthy man while his companion stangerson was comparatively poor there was no clue at all however as to their whereabouts  many a man however vindictive would have abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty but jefferson hope never faltered for a moment with the small competence he possessed eked out by such employment as he could pick up he travelled from town to town through the united states in quest of his enemies year passed into year his black hair turned grizzled but still he wandered on a human bloodhound with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life at last his perseverance was rewarded it was but a glance of a face in a window but that one glance told him that cleveland in ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of he returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged it chanced however that drebber looking from his window had recognized the vagrant in the street and had read murder in his eyes he hurried before a justice of the peace accompanied by stangerson who had become his private secretary and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival that evening jefferson hope was taken into custody and not being able to find sureties was detained for some weeks when at last he was liberated it was only to find that drebbers house was deserted and that he and his secretary had departed for europe  again the avenger had been foiled and again his concentrated hatred urged him to continue the pursuit funds were wanting however and for some time he had to return to work saving every dollar for his approaching journey at last having collected enough to keep life in him he departed for europe and tracked his enemies from city to city working his way in any menial capacity but never overtaking the fugitives when he reached st petersburg they had departed for paris and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off for copenhagen at the danish capital he was again a few days late for they had journeyed on to london where he at last succeeded in running them to earth as to what occurred there we cannot do better than quote the old hunters own account as duly recorded in dr watsons journal to which we are already under such obligations     chapter vi a continuation of the reminiscences of john watson md   our prisoners furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves for on finding himself powerless he smiled in an affable manner and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle i guess youre going to take me to the policestation he remarked to sherlock holmes my cabs at the door if youll loose my legs ill walk down to it im not so light to lift as i used to be  gregson and lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one but holmes at once took the prisoner at his word and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ankles he rose and stretched his legs as though to assure himself that they were free once more i remember that i thought to myself as i eyed him that i had seldom seen a more powerfully built man and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength  if theres a vacant place for a chief of the police i reckon you are the man for it he said gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellowlodger the way you kept on my trail was a caution  you had better come with me said holmes to the two detectives  i can drive you said lestrade  good and gregson can come inside with me you too doctor you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us  i assented gladly and we all descended together our prisoner made no attempt at escape but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his and we followed him lestrade mounted the box whipped up the horse and brought us in a very short time to our destination we were ushered into a small chamber where a police inspector noted down our prisoners name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged the official was a whitefaced unemotional man who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way the prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week he said in the mean time mr jefferson hope have you anything that you wish to say i must warn you that your words will be taken down and may be used against you  ive got a good deal to say our prisoner said slowly i want to tell you gentlemen all about it  hadnt you better reserve that for your trial asked the inspector  i may never be tried he answered you neednt look startled it isnt suicide i am thinking of are you a doctor he turned his fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question  yes i am i answered  then put your hand here he said with a smile motioning with his manacled wrists towards his chest  i did so and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside the walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work in the silence of the room i could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source  why i cried you have an aortic aneurism  thats what they call it he said placidly i went to a doctor last week about it and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed it has been getting worse for years i got it from overexposure and underfeeding among the salt lake mountains ive done my work now and i dont care how soon i go but i should like to leave some account of the business behind me i dont want to be remembered as a common cutthroat  the inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the advisability of allowing him to tell his story  do you consider doctor that there is immediate danger the former asked  most certainly there is i answered  in that case it is clearly our duty in the interests of justice to take his statement said the inspector you are at liberty sir to give your account which i again warn you will be taken down  ill sit down with your leave the prisoner said suiting the action to the word this aneurism of mine makes me easily tired and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters im on the brink of the grave and i am not likely to lie to you every word i say is the absolute truth and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me  with these words jefferson hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement he spoke in a calm and methodical manner as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough i can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account for i have had access to lestrades notebook in which the prisoners words were taken down exactly as they were uttered  it dont much matter to you why i hated these men he said its enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beingsa father and a daughterand that they had therefore forfeited their own lives after the lapse of time that has passed since their crime it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court i knew of their guilt though and i determined that i should be judge jury and executioner all rolled into one youd have done the same if you have any manhood in you if you had been in my place  that girl that i spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago she was forced into marrying that same drebber and broke her heart over it i took the marriage ring from her dead finger and i vowed that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished i have carried it about with me and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents until i caught them they thought to tire me out but they could not do it if i die tomorrow as is likely enough i die knowing that my work in this world is done and well done they have perished and by my hand there is nothing left for me to hope for or to desire  they were rich and i was poor so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them when i got to london my pocket was about empty and i found that i must turn my hand to something for my living driving and riding are as natural to me as walking so i applied at a cabowners office and soon got employment i was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner and whatever was over that i might keep for myself there was seldom much over but i managed to scrape along somehow the hardest job was to learn my way about for i reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived this city is the most confusing i had a map beside me though and when once i had spotted the principal hotels and stations i got on pretty well  it was some time before i found out where my two gentlemen were living but i inquired and inquired until at last i dropped across them they were at a boardinghouse at camberwell over on the other side of the river when once i found them out i knew that i had them at my mercy i had grown my beard and there was no chance of their recognizing me i would dog them and follow them until i saw my opportunity i was determined that they should not escape me again  they were very near doing it for all that go where they would about london i was always at their heels sometimes i followed them on my cab and sometimes on foot but the former was the best for then they could not get away from me it was only early in the morning or late at night that i could earn anything so that i began to get behind hand with my employer i did not mind that however as long as i could lay my hand upon the men i wanted  they were very cunning though they must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed for they would never go out alone and never after nightfall during two weeks i drove behind them every day and never once saw them separate drebber himself was drunk half the time but stangerson was not to be caught napping i watched them late and early but never saw the ghost of a chance but i was not discouraged for something told me that the hour had almost come my only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone  at last one evening i was driving up and down torquay terrace as the street was called in which they boarded when i saw a cab drive up to their door presently some luggage was brought out and after a time drebber and stangerson followed it and drove off i whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them feeling very ill at ease for i feared that they were going to shift their quarters at euston station they got out and i left a boy to hold my horse and followed them on to the platform i heard them ask for the liverpool train and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours stangerson seemed to be put out at that but drebber was rather pleased than otherwise i got so close to them in the bustle that i could hear every word that passed between them drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him his companion remonstrated with him and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one and that he must go alone i could not catch what stangerson said to that but the other burst out swearing and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant and that he must not presume to dictate to him on that the secretary gave it up as a bad job and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at hallidays private hotel to which drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven and made his way out of the station  the moment for which i had waited so long had at last come i had my enemies within my power together they could protect each other but singly they were at my mercy i did not act however with undue precipitation my plans were already formed there is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him and why retribution has come upon him i had my plans arranged by which i should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out it chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the brixton road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage it was claimed that same evening and returned but in the interval i had taken a moulding of it and had a duplicate constructed by means of this i had access to at least one spot in this great city where i could rely upon being free from interruption how to get drebber to that house was the difficult problem which i had now to solve  he walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops staying for nearly halfanhour in the last of them when he came out he staggered in his walk and was evidently pretty well on there was a hansom just in front of me and he hailed it i followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way we rattled across waterloo bridge and through miles of streets until to my astonishment we found ourselves back in the terrace in which he had boarded i could not imagine what his intention was in returning there but i went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house he entered it and his hansom drove away give me a glass of water if you please my mouth gets dry with the talking  i handed him the glass and he drank it down  thats better he said well i waited for a quarter of an hour or more when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared one of whom was drebber and the other was a young chap whom i had never seen before this fellow had drebber by the collar and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road you hound he cried shaking his stick at him ill teach you to insult an honest girl he was so hot that i think he would have thrashed drebber with his cudgel only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him he ran as far as the corner and then seeing my cab he hailed me and jumped in drive me to hallidays private hotel said he  when i had him fairly inside my cab my heart jumped so with joy that i feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong i drove along slowly weighing in my own mind what it was best to do i might take him right out into the country and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him i had almost decided upon this when he solved the problem for me the craze for drink had seized him again and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace he went in leaving word that i should wait for him there he remained until closing time and when he came out he was so far gone that i knew the game was in my own hands  dont imagine that i intended to kill him in cold blood it would only have been rigid justice if i had done so but i could not bring myself to do it i had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it among the many billets which i have filled in america during my wandering life i was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at york college one day the professor was lecturing on poisons and he showed his students some alkaloid as he called it which he had extracted from some south american arrow poison and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death i spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept and when they were all gone i helped myself to a little of it i was a fairly good dispenser so i worked this alkaloid into small soluble pills and each pill i put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison i determined at the time that when i had my chance my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes while i ate the pill that remained it would be quite as deadly and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief from that day i had always my pill boxes about with me and the time had now come when i was to use them  it was nearer one than twelve and a wild bleak night blowing hard and raining in torrents dismal as it was outside i was glad withinso glad that i could have shouted out from pure exultation if any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing and longed for it during twenty long years and then suddenly found it within your reach you would understand my feelings i lit a cigar and puffed at it to steady my nerves but my hands were trembling and my temples throbbing with excitement as i drove i could see old john ferrier and sweet lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me just as plain as i see you all in this room all the way they were ahead of me one on each side of the horse until i pulled up at the house in the brixton road  there was not a soul to be seen nor a sound to be heard except the dripping of the rain when i looked in at the window i found drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep i shook him by the arm its time to get out i said  all right cabby said he  i suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned for he got out without another word and followed me down the garden i had to walk beside him to keep him steady for he was still a little topheavy when we came to the door i opened it and led him into the front room i give you my word that all the way the father and the daughter were walking in front of us  its infernally dark said he stamping about  well soon have a light i said striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which i had brought with me now enoch drebber i continued turning to him and holding the light to my own face who am i  he gazed at me with bleared drunken eyes for a moment and then i saw a horror spring up in them and convulse his whole features which showed me that he knew me he staggered back with a livid face and i saw the perspiration break out upon his brow while his teeth chattered in his head at the sight i leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long i had always known that vengeance would be sweet but i had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me  you dog i said i have hunted you from salt lake city to st petersburg and you have always escaped me now at last your wanderings have come to an end for either you or i shall never see tomorrows sun rise he shrunk still further away as i spoke and i could see on his face that he thought i was mad so i was for the time the pulses in my temples beat like sledgehammers and i believe i would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me  what do you think of lucy ferrier now i cried locking the door and shaking the key in his face punishment has been slow in coming but it has overtaken you at last i saw his coward lips tremble as i spoke he would have begged for his life but he knew well that it was useless  would you murder me he stammered  there is no murder i answered who talks of murdering a mad dog what mercy had you upon my poor darling when you dragged her from her slaughtered father and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem  it was not i who killed her father he cried  but it was you who broke her innocent heart i shrieked thrusting the box before him let the high god judge between us choose and eat there is death in one and life in the other i shall take what you leave let us see if there is justice upon the earth or if we are ruled by chance  he cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy but i drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me then i swallowed the other and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more waiting to see which was to live and which was to die shall i ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system i laughed as i saw it and held lucys marriage ring in front of his eyes it was but for a moment for the action of the alkaloid is rapid a spasm of pain contorted his features he threw his hands out in front of him staggered and then with a hoarse cry fell heavily upon the floor i turned him over with my foot and placed my hand upon his heart there was no movement he was dead  the blood had been streaming from my nose but i had taken no notice of it i dont know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track for i felt lighthearted and cheerful i remembered a german being found in new york with rache written up above him and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it i guessed that what puzzled the new yorkers would puzzle the londoners so i dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall then i walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about and that the night was still very wild i had driven some distance when i put my hand into the pocket in which i usually kept lucys ring and found that it was not there i was thunderstruck at this for it was the only memento that i had of her thinking that i might have dropped it when i stooped over drebbers body i drove back and leaving my cab in a side street i went boldly up to the housefor i was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring when i arrived there i walked right into the arms of a policeofficer who was coming out and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk  that was how enoch drebber came to his end all i had to do then was to do as much for stangerson and so pay off john ferriers debt i knew that he was staying at hallidays private hotel and i hung about all day but he never came out i fancy that he suspected something when drebber failed to put in an appearance he was cunning was stangerson and always on his guard if he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken i soon found out which was the window of his bedroom and early next morning i took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn i woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before i described drebbers death to him and i gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills instead of grasping at the chance of safety which that offered him he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat in selfdefence i stabbed him to the heart it would have been the same in any case for providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison  i have little more to say and its as well for i am about done up i went on cabbing it for a day or so intending to keep at it until i could save enough to take me back to america i was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called jefferson hope and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221b baker street i went round suspecting no harm and the next thing i knew this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists and as neatly shackled as ever i saw in my life thats the whole of my story gentlemen you may consider me to be a murderer but i hold that i am just as much an officer of justice as you are  so thrilling had the mans narrative been and his manner was so impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed even the professional detectives blasé as they were in every detail of crime appeared to be keenly interested in the mans story when he finished we sat for some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of lestrades pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand account  there is only one point on which i should like a little more information sherlock holmes said at last who was your accomplice who came for the ring which i advertised  the prisoner winked at my friend jocosely i can tell my own secrets he said but i dont get other people into trouble i saw your advertisement and i thought it might be a plant or it might be the ring which i wanted my friend volunteered to go and see i think youll own he did it smartly  not a doubt of that said holmes heartily  now gentlemen the inspector remarked gravely the forms of the law must be complied with on thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates and your attendance will be required until then i will be responsible for him he rang the bell as he spoke and jefferson hope was led off by a couple of warders while my friend and i made our way out of the station and took a cab back to baker street     chapter vii the conclusion   we had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the thursday but when the thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony a higher judge had taken the matter in hand and jefferson hope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him on the very night after his capture the aneurism burst and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell with a placid smile upon his face as though he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life and on work well done  gregson and lestrade will be wild about his death holmes remarked as we chatted it over next evening where will their grand advertisement be now  i dont see that they had very much to do with his capture i answered  what you do in this world is a matter of no consequence returned my companion bitterly the question is what can you make people believe that you have done never mind he continued more brightly after a pause i would not have missed the investigation for anything there has been no better case within my recollection simple as it was there were several most instructive points about it  simple i ejaculated  well really it can hardly be described as otherwise said sherlock holmes smiling at my surprise the proof of its intrinsic simplicity is that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions i was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days  that is true said i  i have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance in solving a problem of this sort the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards that is a very useful accomplishment and a very easy one but people do not practise it much in the everyday affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards and so the other comes to be neglected there are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically  i confess said i that i do not quite follow you  i hardly expected that you would let me see if i can make it clearer most people if you describe a train of events to them will tell you what the result would be they can put those events together in their minds and argue from them that something will come to pass there are few people however who if you told them a result would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result this power is what i mean when i talk of reasoning backwards or analytically  i understand said i  now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning to begin at the beginning i approached the house as you know on foot and with my mind entirely free from all impressions i naturally began by examining the roadway and there as i have already explained to you i saw clearly the marks of a cab which i ascertained by inquiry must have been there during the night i satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels the ordinary london growler is considerably less wide than a gentlemans brougham  this was the first point gained i then walked slowly down the garden path which happened to be composed of a clay soil peculiarly suitable for taking impressions no doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning there is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps happily i have always laid great stress upon it and much practice has made it second nature to me i saw the heavy footmarks of the constables but i saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden it was easy to tell that they had been before the others because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them in this way my second link was formed which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number one remarkable for his height as i calculated from the length of his stride and the other fashionably dressed to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots  on entering the house this last inference was confirmed my wellbooted man lay before me the tall one then had done the murder if murder there was there was no wound upon the dead mans person but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him men who die from heart disease or any sudden natural cause never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features having sniffed the dead mans lips i detected a slightly sour smell and i came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him again i argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face by the method of exclusion i had arrived at this result for no other hypothesis would meet the facts do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea the forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals the cases of dolsky in odessa and of leturier in montpellier will occur at once to any toxicologist  and now came the great question as to the reason why robbery had not been the object of the murder for nothing was taken was it politics then or was it a woman that was the question which confronted me i was inclined from the first to the latter supposition political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly this murder had on the contrary been done most deliberately and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room showing that he had been there all the time it must have been a private wrong and not a political one which called for such a methodical revenge when the inscription was discovered upon the wall i was more inclined than ever to my opinion the thing was too evidently a blind when the ring was found however it settled the question clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman it was at this point that i asked gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to cleveland as to any particular point in mr drebbers former career he answered you remember in the negative  i then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderers height and furnished me with the additional details as to the trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails i had already come to the conclusion since there were no signs of a struggle that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderers nose in his excitement i could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet it is seldom that any man unless he is very fullblooded breaks out in this way through emotion so i hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddyfaced man events proved that i had judged correctly  having left the house i proceeded to do what gregson had neglected i telegraphed to the head of the police at cleveland limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of enoch drebber the answer was conclusive it told me that drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love named jefferson hope and that this same hope was at present in europe i knew now that i held the clue to the mystery in my hand and all that remained was to secure the murderer  i had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with drebber was none other than the man who had driven the cab the marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it where then could the driver be unless he were inside the house again it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes as it were of a third person who was sure to betray him lastly supposing one man wished to dog another through london what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver all these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that jefferson hope was to be found among the jarveys of the metropolis  if he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be on the contrary from his point of view any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself he would probably for a time at least continue to perform his duties there was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one i therefore organized my street arab detective corps and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in london until they ferreted out the man that i wanted how well they succeeded and how quickly i took advantage of it are still fresh in your recollection the murder of stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected but which could hardly in any case have been prevented through it as you know i came into possession of the pills the existence of which i had already surmised you see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw  it is wonderful i cried your merits should be publicly recognized you should publish an account of the case if you wont i will for you  you may do what you like doctor he answered see here he continued handing a paper over to me look at this  it was the echo for the day and the paragraph to which he pointed was devoted to the case in question  the public it said have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man hope who was suspected of the murder of mr enoch drebber and of mr joseph stangerson the details of the case will probably be never known now though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud in which love and mormonism bore a part it seems that both the victims belonged in their younger days to the latter day saints and hope the deceased prisoner hails also from salt lake city if the case has had no other effect it at least brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home and not to carry them on to british soil it is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the wellknown scotland yard officials messrs lestrade and gregson the man was apprehended it appears in the rooms of a certain mr sherlock holmes who has himself as an amateur shown some talent in the detective line and who with such instructors may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill it is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services  didnt i tell you so when we started cried sherlock holmes with a laugh thats the result of all our study in scarlet  to get them a testimonial  never mind i answered i have all the facts in my journal and the public shall know them in the meantime you must make yourself contented by the consciousness of success like the roman miser   populus me sibilat at mihi plaudo ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca,study in scarlet,arthur conan doyle 
the adventures of sherlock holmes  by arthur conan doyle     i  to sherlock holmes she is always the woman i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name in his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler all emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind he was i take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position he never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer they were admirable things for the observerexcellent for drawing the veil from mens motives and actions but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own highpower lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his and yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late irene adler of dubious and questionable memory  i had seen little of holmes lately my marriage had drifted us away from each other my own complete happiness and the homecentred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in baker street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature he was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings  of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland beyond these signs of his activity however which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press i knew little of my former friend and companion  one nightit was on the twentieth of march 1888i was returning from a journey to a patient for i had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through baker street as i passed the wellremembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as i looked up i saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him to me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story he was at work again he had risen out of his drugcreated dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own  his manner was not effusive it seldom was but he was glad i think to see me with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion  wedlock suits you he remarked i think watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you  seven i answered  indeed i should have thought a little more just a trifle more i fancy watson and in practice again i observe you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness  then how do you know  i see it i deduce it how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl  my dear holmes said i this is too much you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i cant imagine how you deduce it as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again i fail to see how you work it out  he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together  it is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant bootslitting specimen of the london slavey as to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his tophat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession  i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction when i hear you give your reasons i remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours  quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair you see but you do not observe the distinction is clear for example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room  frequently  how often  well some hundreds of times  then how many are there  how many i dont know  quite so you have not observed and yet you have seen that is just my point now i know that there are seventeen steps because i have both seen and observed by the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this he threw over a sheet of thick pinktinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table it came by the last post said he read it aloud  the note was undated and without either signature or address  there will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight oclock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated this account of you we have from all quarters received be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask  this is indeed a mystery i remarked what do you imagine that it means  i have no data yet it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts but the note itself what do you deduce from it  i carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was written  the man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarked endeavouring to imitate my companions processes such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet it is peculiarly strong and stiff  peculiarthat is the very word said holmes it is not an english paper at all hold it up to the light  i did so and saw a large e with a small g a p and a large g with a small t woven into the texture of the paper  what do you make of that asked holmes  the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather  not at all the g with the small t stands for gesellschaft which is the german for company it is a customary contraction like our co p of course stands for papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental gazetteer he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves eglow eglonitzhere we are egria it is in a germanspeaking countryin bohemia not far from carlsbad remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous glassfactories and papermills ha ha my boy what do you make of that his eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette  the paper was made in bohemia i said  precisely and the man who wrote the note is a german do you note the peculiar construction of the sentencethis account of you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian could not have written that it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs it only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face and here he comes if i am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts  as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell holmes whistled  a pair by the sound said he yes he continued glancing out of the window a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties a hundred and fifty guineas apiece theres money in this case watson if there is nothing else  i think that i had better go holmes  not a bit doctor stay where you are i am lost without my boswell and this promises to be interesting it would be a pity to miss it  but your client  never mind him i may want your help and so may he here he comes sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention  a slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside the door then there was a loud and authoritative tap  come in said holmes  a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a hercules his dress was rich with a richness which would in england be looked upon as akin to bad taste heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his doublebreasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flamecoloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance he carried a broadbrimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy  you had my note he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked german accent i told you that i would call he looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address  pray take a seat said holmes this is my friend and colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases whom have i the honour to address  you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman i understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance if not i should much prefer to communicate with you alone  i rose to go but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair it is both or none said he you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me  the count shrugged his broad shoulders then i must begin said he by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history  i promise said holmes  and i  you will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my own  i was aware of it said holmes dryly  the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia  i was also aware of that murmured holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes  our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client  if your majesty would condescend to state your case he remarked i should be better able to advise you  the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground you are right he cried i am the king why should i attempt to conceal it  why indeed murmured holmes your majesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein grand duke of casselfelstein and hereditary king of bohemia  but you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power i have come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting you  then pray consult said holmes shutting his eyes once more  the facts are briefly these  some five years ago during a lengthy visit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the wellknown adventuress irene adler the name is no doubt familiar to you  kindly look her up in my index doctor murmured holmes without opening his eyes for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staffcommander who had written a monograph upon the deepsea fishes  let me see said holmes hum born in new jersey in the year 1858 contraltohum la scala hum prima donna imperial opera of warsawyes retired from operatic stageha living in londonquite so your majesty as i understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back  precisely so but how  was there a secret marriage  none  no legal papers or certificates  none  then i fail to follow your majesty if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity  there is the writing  pooh pooh forgery  my private notepaper  stolen  my own seal  imitated  my photograph  bought  we were both in the photograph  oh dear that is very bad your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion  i was madinsane  you have compromised yourself seriously  i was only crown prince then i was young i am but thirty now  it must be recovered  we have tried and failed  your majesty must pay it must be bought  she will not sell  stolen then  five attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice she has been waylaid there has been no result  no sign of it  absolutely none  holmes laughed it is quite a pretty little problem said he  but a very serious one to me returned the king reproachfully  very indeed and what does she propose to do with the photograph  to ruin me  but how  i am about to be married  so i have heard  to clotilde lothman von saxemeningen second daughter of the king of scandinavia you may know the strict principles of her family she is herself the very soul of delicacy a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end  and irene adler  threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it i know that she will do it you do not know her but she has a soul of steel she has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men rather than i should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not gonone  you are sure that she has not sent it yet  i am sure  and why  because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be next monday  oh then we have three days yet said holmes with a yawn that is very fortunate as i have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present your majesty will of course stay in london for the present  certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm  then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress  pray do so i shall be all anxiety  then as to money  you have carte blanche  absolutely  i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph  and for present expenses  the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table  there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he said  holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook and handed it to him  and mademoiselles address he asked  is briony lodge serpentine avenue st johns wood  holmes took a note of it one other question said he was the photograph a cabinet  it was  then goodnight your majesty and i trust that we shall soon have some good news for you and goodnight watson he added as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street if you will be good enough to call tomorrow afternoon at three oclock i should like to chat this little matter over with you   ii  at three oclock precisely i was at baker street but holmes had not yet returned the landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight oclock in the morning i sat down beside the fire however with the intention of awaiting him however long he might be i was already deeply interested in his inquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded still the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head  it was close upon four before the door opened and a drunkenlooking groom illkempt and sidewhiskered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room accustomed as i was to my friends amazing powers in the use of disguises i had to look three times before i was certain that it was indeed he with a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutes tweedsuited and respectable as of old putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes  well really he cried and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the chair  what is it  its quite too funny i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning or what i ended by doing  i cant imagine i suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of miss irene adler  quite so but the sequel was rather unusual i will tell you however i left the house a little after eight oclock this morning in the character of a groom out of work there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men be one of them and you will know all that there is to know i soon found briony lodge it is a bijou villa with a garden at the back but built out in front right up to the road two stories chubb lock to the door large sittingroom on the right side well furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coachhouse i walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view but without noting anything else of interest  i then lounged down the street and found as i expected that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in exchange twopence a glass of halfandhalf two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as i could desire about miss adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to  and what of irene adler i asked  oh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet so say the serpentinemews to a man she lives quietly sings at concerts drives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp for dinner seldom goes out at other times except when she sings has only one male visitor but a good deal of him he is dark handsome and dashing never calls less than once a day and often twice he is a mr godfrey norton of the inner temple see the advantages of a cabman as a confidant they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentinemews and knew all about him when i had listened to all they had to tell i began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more and to think over my plan of campaign  this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter he was a lawyer that sounded ominous what was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits was she his client his friend or his mistress if the former she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping if the latter it was less likely on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge or turn my attention to the gentlemans chambers in the temple it was a delicate point and it widened the field of my inquiry i fear that i bore you with these details but i have to let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the situation  i am following you closely i answered  i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to briony lodge and a gentleman sprang out he was a remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustachedevidently the man of whom i had heard he appeared to be in a great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home  he was in the house about half an hour and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sittingroom pacing up and down talking excitedly and waving his arms of her i could see nothing presently he emerged looking even more flurried than before as he stepped up to the cab he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly drive like the devil he shouted first to gross & hankeys in regent street and then to the church of st monica in the edgeware road half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes  away they went and i was just wondering whether i should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau the coachman with his coat only halfbuttoned and his tie under his ear while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles it hadnt pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for  the church of st monica john she cried and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes  this was quite too good to lose watson i was just balancing whether i should run for it or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare but i jumped in before he could object the church of st monica said i and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes it was twentyfive minutes to twelve and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind  my cabby drove fast i dont think i ever drove faster but the others were there before us the cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived i paid the man and hurried into the church there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman who seemed to be expostulating with them they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round to me and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me  thank god he cried youll do come come  what then i asked  come man come only three minutes or it wont be legal  i was halfdragged up to the altar and before i knew where i was i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear and vouching for things of which i knew nothing and generally assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler spinster to godfrey norton bachelor it was all done in an instant and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front it was the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my life and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now it seems that there had been some informality about their license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man the bride gave me a sovereign and i mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion  this is a very unexpected turn of affairs said i and what then  well i found my plans very seriously menaced it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part at the church door however they separated he driving back to the temple and she to her own house i shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said as she left him i heard no more they drove away in different directions and i went off to make my own arrangements  which are  some cold beef and a glass of beer he answered ringing the bell i have been too busy to think of food and i am likely to be busier still this evening by the way doctor i shall want your cooperation  i shall be delighted  you dont mind breaking the law  not in the least  nor running a chance of arrest  not in a good cause  oh the cause is excellent  then i am your man  i was sure that i might rely on you  but what is it you wish  when mrs turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided i must discuss it while i eat for i have not much time it is nearly five now in two hours we must be on the scene of action miss irene or madame rather returns from her drive at seven we must be at briony lodge to meet her  and what then  you must leave that to me i have already arranged what is to occur there is only one point on which i must insist you must not interfere come what may you understand  i am to be neutral  to do nothing whatever there will probably be some small unpleasantness do not join in it it will end in my being conveyed into the house four or five minutes afterwards the sittingroom window will open you are to station yourself close to that open window  yes  you are to watch me for i will be visible to you  yes  and when i raise my handsoyou will throw into the room what i give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire you quite follow me  entirely  it is nothing very formidable he said taking a long cigarshaped roll from his pocket it is an ordinary plumbers smokerocket fitted with a cap at either end to make it selflighting your task is confined to that when you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people you may then walk to the end of the street and i will rejoin you in ten minutes i hope that i have made myself clear  i am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street  precisely  then you may entirely rely on me  that is excellent i think perhaps it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play  he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simpleminded nonconformist clergyman his broad black hat his baggy trousers his white tie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr john hare alone could have equalled it was not merely that holmes changed his costume his expression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed the stage lost a fine actor even as science lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist in crime  it was a quarter past six when we left baker street and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue it was already dusk and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge waiting for the coming of its occupant the house was just such as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes succinct description but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected on the contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it was remarkably animated there was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner a scissorsgrinder with his wheel two guardsmen who were flirting with a nursegirl and several welldressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths  you see remarked holmes as we paced to and fro in front of the house this marriage rather simplifies matters the photograph becomes a doubleedged weapon now the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess now the question is where are we to find the photograph  where indeed  it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her it is cabinet size too large for easy concealment about a womans dress she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we may take it then that she does not carry it about with her  where then  her banker or her lawyer there is that double possibility but i am inclined to think neither women are naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting why should she hand it over to anyone else she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man besides remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days it must be where she can lay her hands upon it it must be in her own house  but it has twice been burgled  pshaw they did not know how to look  but how will you look  i will not look  what then  i will get her to show me  but she will refuse  she will not be able to but i hear the rumble of wheels it is her carriage now carry out my orders to the letter  as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue it was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of briony lodge as it pulled up one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention a fierce quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen who took sides with one of the loungers and by the scissorsgrinder who was equally hot upon the other side a blow was struck and in an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other while a number of better dressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man irene adler as i will still call her had hurried up the steps but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking back into the street  is the poor gentleman much hurt she asked  he is dead cried several voices  no no theres life in him shouted another but hell be gone before you can get him to hospital  hes a brave fellow said a woman they would have had the ladys purse and watch if it hadnt been for him they were a gang and a rough one too ah hes breathing now  he cant lie in the street may we bring him in marm  surely bring him into the sittingroom there is a comfortable sofa this way please  slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the principal room while i still observed the proceedings from my post by the window the lamps had been lit but the blinds had not been drawn so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch i do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me i hardened my heart and took the smokerocket from under my ulster after all i thought we are not injuring her we are but preventing her from injuring another  holmes had sat up upon the couch and i saw him motion like a man who is in need of air a maid rushed across and threw open the window at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of fire the word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators well dressed and illgentlemen ostlers and servant maidsjoined in a general shriek of fire thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window i caught a glimpse of rushing figures and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friends arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road  you did it very nicely doctor he remarked nothing could have been better it is all right  you have the photograph  i know where it is  and how did you find out  she showed me as i told you she would  i am still in the dark  i do not wish to make a mystery said he laughing the matter was perfectly simple you of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice they were all engaged for the evening  i guessed as much  then when the row broke out i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand i rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my face and became a piteous spectacle it is an old trick  that also i could fathom  then they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else could she do and into her sittingroom which was the very room which i suspected it lay between that and her bedroom and i was determined to see which they laid me on a couch i motioned for air they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance  how did that help you  it was allimportant when a woman thinks that her house is on fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most it is a perfectly overpowering impulse and i have more than once taken advantage of it in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me and also in the arnsworth castle business a married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her jewelbox now it was clear to me that our lady of today had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of she would rush to secure it the alarm of fire was admirably done the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel she responded beautifully the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bellpull she was there in an instant and i caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out when i cried out that it was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and i have not seen her since i rose and making my excuses escaped from the house i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait a little overprecipitance may ruin all  and now i asked  our quest is practically finished i shall call with the king tomorrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be shown into the sittingroom to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands  and when will you call  at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall have a clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits i must wire to the king without delay  we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said   goodnight mister sherlock holmes  there were several people on the pavement at the time but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by  ive heard that voice before said holmes staring down the dimly lit street now i wonder who the deuce that could have been   iii  i slept at baker street that night and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room  you have really got it he cried grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face  not yet  but you have hopes  i have hopes  then come i am all impatience to be gone  we must have a cab  no my brougham is waiting  then that will simplify matters we descended and started off once more for briony lodge  irene adler is married remarked holmes  married when  yesterday  but to whom  to an english lawyer named norton  but she could not love him  i am in hopes that she does  and why in hopes  because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance if the lady loves her husband she does not love your majesty if she does not love your majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your majestys plan  it is true and yet well i wish she had been of my own station what a queen she would have made he relapsed into a moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue  the door of briony lodge was open and an elderly woman stood upon the steps she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham  mr sherlock holmes i believe said she  i am mr holmes answered my companion looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze  indeed my mistress told me that you were likely to call she left this morning with her husband by the 5 15 train from charing cross for the continent  what sherlock holmes staggered back white with chagrin and surprise do you mean that she has left england  never to return  and the papers asked the king hoarsely all is lost  we shall see he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawingroom followed by the king and myself the furniture was scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and open drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight holmes rushed at the bellpull tore back a small sliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out a photograph and a letter the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress the letter was superscribed to sherlock holmes esq to be left till called for my friend tore it open and we all three read it together it was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way       my dear mr sherlock holmesyou really did it very well you took     me in completely until after the alarm of fire i had not a     suspicion but then when i found how i had betrayed myself i     began to think i had been warned against you months ago i had     been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly     be you and your address had been given me yet with all this you     made me reveal what you wanted to know even after i became     suspicious i found it hard to think evil of such a dear kind old     clergyman but you know i have been trained as an actress myself     male costume is nothing new to me i often take advantage of the     freedom which it gives i sent john the coachman to watch you     ran upstairs got into my walking clothes as i call them and came     down just as you departed      well i followed you to your door and so made sure that i was     really an object of interest to the celebrated mr sherlock holmes     then i rather imprudently wished you goodnight and started for     the temple to see my husband      we both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so     formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty when you     call tomorrow as to the photograph your client may rest in     peace i love and am loved by a better man than he the king may do     what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly     wronged i keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve a     weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might     take in the future i leave a photograph which he might care to     possess and i remain dear mr sherlock holmes       very truly yours      irene norton née adler   what a womanoh what a woman cried the king of bohemia when we had all three read this epistle did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was would she not have made an admirable queen is it not a pity that she was not on my level  from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty said holmes coldly i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majestys business to a more successful conclusion  on the contrary my dear sir cried the king nothing could be more successful i know that her word is inviolate the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire  i am glad to hear your majesty say so  i am immensely indebted to you pray tell me in what way i can reward you this ring he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand  your majesty has something which i should value even more highly said holmes  you have but to name it  this photograph  the king stared at him in amazement  irenes photograph he cried certainly if you wish it  i thank your majesty then there is no more to be done in the matter i have the honour to wish you a very good morning he bowed and turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him he set off in my company for his chambers  and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of bohemia and how the best plans of mr sherlock holmes were beaten by a womans wit he used to make merry over the cleverness of women but i have not heard him do it of late and when he speaks of irene adler or when he refers to her photograph it is always under the honourable title of the woman     ii the redheaded league    i had called upon my friend mr sherlock holmes one day in the  autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very  stout floridfaced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair with an  apology for my intrusion i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled  me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me  you could not possibly have come at a better time my dear watson he said cordially  i was afraid that you were engaged  so i am very much so  then i can wait in the next room  not at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also  the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting with a quick little questioning glance from his small fatencircled eyes  try the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in judicial moods i know my dear watson that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures  your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me i observed  you will remember that i remarked the other day just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination  a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting  you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right now mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative i ask you not merely because my friend dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips as a rule when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique  the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat as he glanced down the advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee i took a good look at the man and endeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance  i did not gain very much however by my inspection our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman obese pompous and slow he wore rather baggy grey shepherds check trousers a not overclean black frockcoat unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament a frayed tophat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him altogether look as i would there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features  sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he has been in china and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately i can deduce nothing else  mr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion  how in the name of goodfortune did you know all that mr holmes he asked how did you know for example that i did manual labour its as true as gospel for i began as a ships carpenter  your hands my dear sir your right hand is quite a size larger than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more developed  well the snuff then and the freemasonry  i wont insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arcandcompass breastpin  ah of course i forgot that but the writing  what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk  well but china  the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china when in addition i see a chinese coin hanging from your watchchain the matter becomes even more simple  mr jabez wilson laughed heavily well i never said he i thought at first that you had done something clever but i see that there was nothing in it after all  i begin to think watson said holmes that i make a mistake in explaining omne ignotum pro magnifico you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson  yes i have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column here it is this is what began it all you just read it for yourself sir  i took the paper from him and read as follows   to the redheaded league  on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania usa there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of £ 4 a week for purely nominal services all redheaded men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twentyone years are eligible apply in person on monday at eleven oclock to duncan ross at the offices of the league 7 popes court fleet street   what on earth does this mean i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement  holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in high spirits it is a little off the beaten track isnt it said he and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes you will first make a note doctor of the paper and the date  it is the morning chronicle of april 27 1890 just two months ago  very good now mr wilson  well it is just as i have been telling you mr sherlock holmes said jabez wilson mopping his forehead i have a small pawnbrokers business at coburg square near the city its not a very large affair and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living i used to be able to keep two assistants but now i only keep one and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business  what is the name of this obliging youth asked sherlock holmes  his name is vincent spaulding and hes not such a youth either its hard to say his age i should not wish a smarter assistant mr holmes and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him but after all if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his head  why indeed you seem most fortunate in having an employé who comes under the full market price it is not a common experience among employers in this age i dont know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement  oh he has his faults too said mr wilson never was such a fellow for photography snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures that is his main fault but on the whole hes a good worker theres no vice in him  he is still with you i presume  yes sir he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place cleanthats all i have in the house for i am a widower and never had any family we live very quietly sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing more  the first thing that put us out was that advertisement spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says   i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a redheaded man  why that i asks  why says he heres another vacancy on the league of the redheaded men its worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men so that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money if my hair would only change colour heres a nice little crib all ready for me to step into  why what is it then i asked you see mr holmes i am a very stayathome man and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the doormat in that way i didnt know much of what was going on outside and i was always glad of a bit of news  have you never heard of the league of the redheaded men he asked with his eyes open  never  why i wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies  and what are they worth i asked  oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight and it need not interfere very much with ones other occupations  well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears for the business has not been over good for some years and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy  tell me all about it said i  well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy and there is the address where you should apply for particulars as far as i can make out the league was founded by an american millionaire ezekiah hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways he was himself redheaded and he had a great sympathy for all redheaded men so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do  but said i there would be millions of redheaded men who would apply  not so many as you might think he answered you see it is really confined to londoners and to grown men this american had started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn then again i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but real bright blazing fiery red now if you cared to apply mr wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds  now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me he was very willing to have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement  i never hope to see such a sight as that again mr holmes from north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement fleet street was choked with redheaded folk and popes court looked like a costers orange barrow i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement every shade of colour they werestraw lemon orange brick irishsetter liver clay but as spaulding said there were not many who had the real vivid flamecoloured tint when i saw how many were waiting i would have given it up in despair but spaulding would not hear of it how he did it i could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office there was a double stream upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office  your experience has been a most entertaining one remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff pray continue your very interesting statement  there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine he said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all however when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he might have a private word with us  this is mr jabez wilson said my assistant and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league  and he is admirably suited for it the other answered he has every requirement i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine he took a step backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful then suddenly he plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my success  it would be injustice to hesitate said he you will however i am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution with that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until i yelled with the pain there is water in your eyes said he as he released me i perceive that all is as it should be but we have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint i could tell you tales of cobblers wax which would disgust you with human nature he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled a groan of disappointment came up from below and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a redhead to be seen except my own and that of the manager  my name said he is mr duncan ross and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor are you a married man mr wilson have you a family  i answered that i had not  his face fell immediately  dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed i am sorry to hear you say that the fund was of course for the propagation and spread of the redheads as well as for their maintenance it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor  my face lengthened at this mr holmes for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right  in the case of another said he the objection might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties  well it is a little awkward for i have a business already said i  oh never mind about that mr wilson said vincent spaulding i should be able to look after that for you  what would be the hours i asked  ten to two  now a pawnbrokers business is mostly done of an evening mr holmes especially thursday and friday evening which is just before payday so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings besides i knew that my assistant was a good man and that he would see to anything that turned up  that would suit me very well said i and the pay  is £ 4 a week  and the work  is purely nominal  what do you call purely nominal  well you have to be in the office or at least in the building the whole time if you leave you forfeit your whole position forever the will is very clear upon that point you dont comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time  its only four hours a day and i should not think of leaving said i  no excuse will avail said mr duncan ross neither sickness nor business nor anything else there you must stay or you lose your billet  and the work  is to copy out the encyclopædia britannica there is the first volume of it in that press you must find your own ink pens and blottingpaper but we provide this table and chair will you be ready tomorrow  certainly i answered  then goodbye mr jabez wilson and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do i was so pleased at my own good fortune  well i thought over the matter all day and by evening i was in low spirits again for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what its object might be i could not imagine it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the encyclopædia britannica vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing however in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow so i bought a penny bottle of ink and with a quillpen and seven sheets of foolscap paper i started off for popes court  well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible the table was set out ready for me and mr duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work he started me off upon the letter a and then he left me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me at two oclock he bade me goodday complimented me upon the amount that i had written and locked the door of the office after me  this went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my weeks work it was the same next week and the same the week after every morning i was there at ten and every afternoon i left at two by degrees mr duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning and then after a time he did not come in at all still of course i never dared to leave the room for an instant for i was not sure when he might come and the billet was such a good one and suited me so well that i would not risk the loss of it  eight weeks passed away like this and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the bs before very long it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings and then suddenly the whole business came to an end  to an end  yes sir and no later than this morning i went to my work as usual at ten oclock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack here it is and you can read for yourself  he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of notepaper it read in this fashion   the redheaded league is dissolved october 9 1890   sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter  i cannot see that there is anything very funny cried our client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head if you can do nothing better than laugh at me i can go elsewhere  no no cried holmes shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen i really wouldnt miss your case for the world it is most refreshingly unusual but there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door  i was staggered sir i did not know what to do then i called at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything about it finally i went to the landlord who is an accountant living on the ground floor and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the redheaded league he said that he had never heard of any such body then i asked him who mr duncan ross was he answered that the name was new to him  well said i the gentleman at no 4  what the redheaded man  yes  oh said he his name was william morris he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready he moved out yesterday  where could i find him  oh at his new offices he did tell me the address yes 17 king edward street near st pauls  i started off mr holmes but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial kneecaps and no one in it had ever heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross  and what did you do then asked holmes  i went home to saxecoburg square and i took the advice of my assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post but that was not quite good enough mr holmes i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came right away to you  and you did very wisely said holmes your case is an exceedingly remarkable one and i shall be happy to look into it from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear  grave enough said mr jabez wilson why i have lost four pound a week  as far as you are personally concerned remarked holmes i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league on the contrary you are as i understand richer by some £ 30 to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a you have lost nothing by them  no sir but i want to find out about them and who they are and what their object was in playing this prankif it was a prankupon me it was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two and thirty pounds  we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you and first one or two questions mr wilson this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisementhow long had he been with you  about a month then  how did he come  in answer to an advertisement  was he the only applicant  no i had a dozen  why did you pick him  because he was handy and would come cheap  at half wages in fact  yes  what is he like this vincent spaulding  small stoutbuilt very quick in his ways no hair on his face though hes not short of thirty has a white splash of acid upon his forehead  holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement i thought as much said he have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings  yes sir he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad  hum said holmes sinking back in deep thought he is still with you  oh yes sir i have only just left him  and has your business been attended to in your absence  nothing to complain of sir theres never very much to do of a morning  that will do mr wilson i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two today is saturday and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion  well watson said holmes when our visitor had left us what do you make of it all  i make nothing of it i answered frankly it is a most mysterious business  as a rule said holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be it is your commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify but i must be prompt over this matter  what are you going to do then i asked  to smoke he answered it is quite a three pipe problem and i beg that you wont speak to me for fifty minutes he curled himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his hawklike nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece  sarasate plays at the st jamess hall this afternoon he remarked what do you think watson could your patients spare you for a few hours  i have nothing to do today my practice is never very absorbing  then put on your hat and come i am going through the city first and we can have some lunch on the way i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than italian or french it is introspective and i want to introspect come along  we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate and a short walk took us to saxecoburg square the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning it was a poky little shabbygenteel place where four lines of dingy twostoried brick houses looked out into a small railedin enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smokeladen and uncongenial atmosphere three gilt balls and a brown board with jabez wilson in white letters upon a corner house announced the place where our redheaded client carried on his business sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses finally he returned to the pawnbrokers and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up to the door and knocked it was instantly opened by a brightlooking cleanshaven young fellow who asked him to step in  thank you said holmes i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand  third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly closing the door  smart fellow that observed holmes as we walked away he is in my judgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third i have known something of him before  evidently said i mr wilsons assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the redheaded league i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him  not him  what then  the knees of his trousers  and what did you see  what i expected to see  why did you beat the pavement  my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk we are spies in an enemys country we know something of saxecoburg square let us now explore the parts which lie behind it  the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxecoburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted  let me see said holmes standing at the corner and glancing along the line i should like just to remember the order of the houses here it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london there is mortimers the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank the vegetarian restaurant and mcfarlanes carriagebuilding depot that carries us right on to the other block and now doctor weve done our work so its time we had some play a sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violinland where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no redheaded clients to vex us with their conundrums  my friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuthhound holmes the relentless keenwitted readyhanded criminal agent as it was possible to conceive in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented as i have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy and as i knew well he was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his blackletter editions then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st jamess hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down  you want to go home no doubt doctor he remarked as we emerged  yes it would be as well  and i have some business to do which will take some hours this business at coburg square is serious  why serious  a considerable crime is in contemplation i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it but today being saturday rather complicates matters i shall want your help tonight  at what time  ten will be early enough  i shall be at baker street at ten  very well and i say doctor there may be some little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket he waved his hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the crowd  i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes here i had heard what he had heard i had seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all from the extraordinary story of the redheaded copier of the encyclopædia down to the visit to saxecoburg square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me what was this nocturnal expedition and why should i go armed where were we going and what were we to do i had the hint from holmes that this smoothfaced pawnbrokers assistant was a formidable mana man who might play a deep game i tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation  it was a quarterpast nine when i started from home and made my way across the park and so through oxford street to baker street two hansoms were standing at the door and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men one of whom i recognised as peter jones the official police agent while the other was a long thin sadfaced man with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frockcoat  ha our party is complete said holmes buttoning up his peajacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack watson i think you know mr jones of scotland yard let me introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in tonights adventure  were hunting in couples again doctor you see said jones in his consequential way our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down  i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase observed mr merryweather gloomily  you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir said the police agent loftily he has his own little methods which are if he wont mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him it is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force  oh if you say so mr jones it is all right said the stranger with deference still i confess that i miss my rubber it is the first saturday night for sevenandtwenty years that i have not had my rubber  i think you will find said sherlock holmes that you will play for a higher stake tonight than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more exciting for you mr merryweather the stake will be some £ 30000 and for you jones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands  john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger hes a young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london hes a remarkable man is young john clay his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to eton and oxford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself hell crack a crib in scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next ive been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet  i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight ive had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession it is past ten however and quite time that we started if you two will take the first hansom watson and i will follow in the second  sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gaslit streets until we emerged into farrington street  we are close there now my friend remarked this fellow merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter i thought it as well to have jones with us also he is not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession he has one positive virtue he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone here we are and they are waiting for us  we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate this also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate mr merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earthsmelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes  you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him  nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked looking up in surprise  i must really ask you to be a little more quiet said holmes severely you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere  the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket  we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape we are at present doctoras no doubt you have divinedin the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present  it is our french gold whispered the director we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it  your french gold  yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30000 napoleons from the bank of france it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the crate upon which i sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject  which were very well justified observed holmes and now it is time that we arranged our little plans i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern  and sit in the dark  i am afraid so i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a partie carrée you might have your rubber after all but i see that the enemys preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light and first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down  i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darknesssuch an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moments notice to me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault  they have but one retreat whispered holmes that is back through the house into saxecoburg square i hope that you have done what i asked you jones  i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door  then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent and wait  what a time it seemed from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us my limbs were weary and stiff for i feared to change my position yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions but i could distinguish the deeper heavier inbreath of the bulky jones from the thin sighing note of the bank director from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light  at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white almost womanly hand which felt about in the centre of the little area of light for a minute or more the hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones  its disappearance however was but momentary with a rending tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed the light of a lantern over the edge there peeped a cleancut boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulderhigh and waisthigh until one knee rested upon the edge in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of very red hair  its all clear he whispered have you the chisel and the bags great scott jump archie jump and ill swing for it  sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar the other dived down the hole and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver but holmes hunting crop came down on the mans wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor  its no use john clay said holmes blandly you have no chance at all  so i see the other answered with the utmost coolness i fancy that my pal is all right though i see you have got his coattails  there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes  oh indeed you seem to have done the thing very completely i must compliment you  and i you holmes answered your redheaded idea was very new and effective  youll see your pal again presently said jones hes quicker at climbing down holes than i am just hold out while i fix the derbies  i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins have the goodness also when you address me always to say sir and please  all right said jones with a stare and a snigger well would you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the policestation  that is better said john clay serenely he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective  really mr holmes said mr merryweather as we followed them from the cellar i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience  i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr john clay said holmes i have been at some small expense over this matter which i shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the redheaded league  you see watson he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league and the copying of the encyclopædia must be to get this not overbright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day it was a curious way of managing it but really it would be difficult to suggest a better the method was no doubt suggested to clays ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplices hair the £ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation  but how could you guess what the motive was  had there been women in the house i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue that however was out of the question the mans business was a small one and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations and such an expenditure as they were at it must then be something out of the house what could it be i thought of the assistants fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the cellar the cellar there was the end of this tangled clue then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london he was doing something in the cellarsomething which took many hours a day for months on end what could it be once more i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building  so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind it was not in front then i rang the bell and as i hoped the assistant answered it we have had some skirmishes but we had never set eyes upon each other before i hardly looked at his face his knees were what i wished to see you must yourself have remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were they spoke of those hours of burrowing the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for i walked round the corner saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friends premises and felt that i had solved my problem when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors with the result that you have seen  and how could you tell that they would make their attempt tonight i asked  well when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr jabez wilsons presencein other words that they had completed their tunnel but it was essential that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape for all these reasons i expected them to come tonight  you reasoned it out beautifully i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration it is so long a chain and yet every link rings true  it saved me from ennui he answered yawning alas i already feel it closing in upon me my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence these little problems help me to do so  and you are a benefactor of the race said i  he shrugged his shoulders well perhaps after all it is of some little use he remarked lhomme cest rienlœuvre cest tout as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand     iii a case of identity   my dear fellow said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at baker street life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent we would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence if we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the plannings the crosspurposes the wonderful chains of events working through generations and leading to the most outré results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable  and yet i am not convinced of it i answered the cases which come to light in the papers are as a rule bald enough and vulgar enough we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits and yet the result is it must be confessed neither fascinating nor artistic  a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect remarked holmes this is wanting in the police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace  i smiled and shook my head i can quite understand your thinking so i said of course in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout three continents you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre but herei picked up the morning paper from the groundlet us put it to a practical test here is the first heading upon which i come a husbands cruelty to his wife there is half a column of print but i know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me there is of course the other woman the drink the push the blow the bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady the crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude  indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argument said holmes taking the paper and glancing his eye down it this is the dundas separation case and as it happens i was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it the husband was a teetotaler there was no other woman and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average storyteller take a pinch of snuff doctor and acknowledge that i have scored over you in your example  he held out his snuffbox of old gold with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it  ah said he i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers  and the ring i asked glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger  it was from the reigning family of holland though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems  and have you any on hand just now i asked with interest  some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of interest they are important you understand without being interesting indeed i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a rule is the motive in these cases save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles there is nothing which presents any features of interest it is possible however that i may have something better before very many minutes are over for this is one of my clients or i am much mistaken  he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutraltinted london street looking over his shoulder i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck and a large curling red feather in a broadbrimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her ear from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous hesitating fashion at our windows while her body oscillated backward and forward and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons suddenly with a plunge as of the swimmer who leaves the bank she hurried across the road and we heard the sharp clang of the bell  i have seen those symptoms before said holmes throwing his cigarette into the fire oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de cœur she would like advice but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication and yet even here we may discriminate when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire here we may take it that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or grieved but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts  as he spoke there was a tap at the door and the boy in buttons entered to announce miss mary sutherland while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a fullsailed merchantman behind a tiny pilot boat sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable and having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him  do you not find he said that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting  i did at first she answered but now i know where the letters are without looking then suddenly realising the full purport of his words she gave a violent start and looked up with fear and astonishment upon her broad goodhumoured face youve heard about me mr holmes she cried else how could you know all that  never mind said holmes laughing it is my business to know things perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook if not why should you come to consult me  i came to you sir because i heard of you from mrs etherege whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead oh mr holmes i wish you would do as much for me im not rich but still i have a hundred a year in my own right besides the little that i make by the machine and i would give it all to know what has become of mr hosmer angel  why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry asked sherlock holmes with his fingertips together and his eyes to the ceiling  again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary sutherland yes i did bang out of the house she said for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr windibankthat is my fathertook it all he would not go to the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done it made me mad and i just on with my things and came right away to you  your father said holmes your stepfather surely since the name is different  yes my stepfather i call him father though it sounds funny too for he is only five years and two months older than myself  and your mother is alive  oh yes mother is alive and well i wasnt best pleased mr holmes when she married again so soon after fathers death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself father was a plumber in the tottenham court road and he left a tidy business behind him which mother carried on with mr hardy the foreman but when mr windibank came he made her sell the business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines they got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest which wasnt near as much as father could have got if he had been alive  i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative but on the contrary he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention  your own little income he asked does it come out of the business  oh no sir it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland it is in new zealand stock paying 4½ per cent two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but i can only touch the interest  you interest me extremely said holmes and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year with what you earn into the bargain you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60  i could do with much less than that mr holmes but you understand that as long as i live at home i dont wish to be a burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them of course that is only just for the time mr windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at typewriting it brings me twopence a sheet and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day  you have made your position very clear to me said holmes this is my friend dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr hosmer angel  a flush stole over miss sutherlands face and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket i met him first at the gasfitters ball she said they used to send father tickets when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and sent them to mother mr windibank did not wish us to go he never did wish us to go anywhere he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sundayschool treat but this time i was set on going and i would go for what right had he to prevent he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all fathers friends were to be there and he said that i had nothing fit to wear when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer at last when nothing else would do he went off to france upon the business of the firm but we went mother and i with mr hardy who used to be our foreman and it was there i met mr hosmer angel  i suppose said holmes that when mr windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball  oh well he was very good about it he laughed i remember and shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way  i see then at the gasfitters ball you met as i understand a gentleman called mr hosmer angel  yes sir i met him that night and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met himthat is to say mr holmes i met him twice for walks but after that father came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house any more  no  well you know father didnt like anything of the sort he wouldnt have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle but then as i used to say to mother a woman wants her own circle to begin with and i had not got mine yet  but how about mr hosmer angel did he make no attempt to see you  well father was going off to france again in a week and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone we could write in the meantime and he used to write every day i took the letters in in the morning so there was no need for father to know  were you engaged to the gentleman at this time  oh yes mr holmes we were engaged after the first walk that we took hosmermr angelwas a cashier in an office in leadenhall streetand  what office  thats the worst of it mr holmes i dont know  where did he live then  he slept on the premises  and you dont know his address  noexcept that it was leadenhall street  where did you address your letters then  to the leadenhall street post office to be left till called for he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady so i offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldnt have that for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us that will just show you how fond he was of me mr holmes and the little things that he would think of  it was most suggestive said holmes it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel  he was a very shy man mr holmes he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to be conspicuous very retiring and gentlemanly he was even his voice was gentle hed had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech he was always well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were weak just as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare  well and what happened when mr windibank your stepfather returned to france  mr hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear with my hands on the testament that whatever happened i would always be true to him mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was then when they talked of marrying within the week i began to ask about father but they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him i didnt quite like that mr holmes it seemed funny that i should ask his leave as he was only a few years older than me but i didnt want to do anything on the sly so i wrote to father at bordeaux where the company has its french offices but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding  it missed him then  yes sir for he had started to england just before it arrived  ha that was unfortunate your wedding was arranged then for the friday was it to be in church  yes sir but very quietly it was to be at st saviours near kings cross and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st pancras hotel hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a fourwheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the street we got to the church first and when the fourwheeler drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes that was last friday mr holmes and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him  it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated said holmes  oh no sir he was too good and kind to leave me so why all the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened i was to be true and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us i was always to remember that i was pledged to him and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later it seemed strange talk for a weddingmorning but what has happened since gives a meaning to it  most certainly it does your own opinion is then that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him  yes sir i believe that he foresaw some danger or else he would not have talked so and then i think that what he foresaw happened  but you have no notion as to what it could have been  none  one more question how did your mother take the matter  she was angry and said that i was never to speak of the matter again  and your father did you tell him  yes and he seemed to think with me that something had happened and that i should hear of hosmer again as he said what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church and then leaving me now if he had borrowed my money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him there might be some reason but hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine and yet what could have happened and why could he not write oh it drives me halfmad to think of it and i cant sleep a wink at night she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it  i shall glance into the case for you said holmes rising and i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result let the weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind dwell upon it further above all try to let mr hosmer angel vanish from your memory as he has done from your life  then you dont think ill see him again  i fear not  then what has happened to him  you will leave that question in my hands i should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare  i advertised for him in last saturdays chronicle said she here is the slip and here are four letters from him  thank you and your address  no 31 lyon place camberwell  mr angels address you never had i understand where is your fathers place of business  he travels for westhouse & marbank the great claret importers of fenchurch street  thank you you have made your statement very clearly you will leave the papers here and remember the advice which i have given you let the whole incident be a sealed book and do not allow it to affect your life  you are very kind mr holmes but i cannot do that i shall be true to hosmer he shall find me ready when he comes back  for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned  sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together his legs stretched out in front of him and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe which was to him as a counsellor and having lit it he leaned back in his chair with the thick blue cloudwreaths spinning up from him and a look of infinite languor in his face  quite an interesting study that maiden he observed i found her more interesting than her little problem which by the way is rather a trite one you will find parallel cases if you consult my index in andover in 77 and there was something of the sort at the hague last year old as is the idea however there were one or two details which were new to me but the maiden herself was most instructive  you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me i remarked  not invisible but unnoticed watson you did not know where to look and so you missed all that was important i can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves the suggestiveness of thumbnails or the great issues that may hang from a bootlace now what did you gather from that womans appearance describe it  well she had a slatecoloured broadbrimmed straw hat with a feather of a brickish red her jacket was black with black beads sewn upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments her dress was brown rather darker than coffee colour with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger her boots i didnt observe she had small round hanging gold earrings and a general air of being fairly welltodo in a vulgar comfortable easygoing way  sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled  pon my word watson you are coming along wonderfully you have really done very well indeed it is true that you have missed everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for colour never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details my first glance is always at a womans sleeve in a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser as you observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for showing traces the double line a little above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table was beautifully defined the sewingmachine of the hand type leaves a similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the broadest part as this was i then glanced at her face and observing the dint of a pincenez at either side of her nose i ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting which seemed to surprise her  it surprised me  but surely it was obvious i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were really odd ones the one having a slightly decorated toecap and the other a plain one one was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five and the other at the first third and fifth now when you see that a young lady otherwise neatly dressed has come away from home with odd boots halfbuttoned it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry  and what else i asked keenly interested as i always was by my friends incisive reasoning  i noted in passing that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink she had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep it must have been this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger all this is amusing though rather elementary but i must go back to business watson would you mind reading me the advertised description of mr hosmer angel  i held the little printed slip to the light missing it said on the morning of the fourteenth a gentleman named hosmer angel about five ft seven in in height strongly built sallow complexion black hair a little bald in the centre bushy black sidewhiskers and moustache tinted glasses slight infirmity of speech was dressed when last seen in black frockcoat faced with silk black waistcoat gold albert chain and grey harris tweed trousers with brown gaiters over elasticsided boots known to have been employed in an office in leadenhall street anybody bringing &c &c  that will do said holmes as to the letters he continued glancing over them they are very commonplace absolutely no clue in them to mr angel save that he quotes balzac once there is one remarkable point however which will no doubt strike you  they are typewritten i remarked  not only that but the signature is typewritten look at the neat little hosmer angel at the bottom there is a date you see but no superscription except leadenhall street which is rather vague the point about the signature is very suggestivein fact we may call it conclusive  of what  my dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case  i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted  no that was not the point however i shall write two letters which should settle the matter one is to a firm in the city the other is to the young ladys stepfather mr windibank asking him whether he could meet us here at six oclock tomorrow evening it is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives and now doctor we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim  i had had so many reasons to believe in my friends subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom once only had i known him to fail in the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler photograph but when i looked back to the weird business of the sign of four and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the study in scarlet i felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel  i left him then still puffing at his black clay pipe with the conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland  a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time and the whole of next day i was busy at the bedside of the sufferer it was not until close upon six oclock that i found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street half afraid that i might be too late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery i found sherlock holmes alone however half asleep with his long thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair a formidable array of bottles and testtubes with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him  well have you solved it i asked as i entered  yes it was the bisulphate of baryta  no no the mystery i cried  oh that i thought of the salt that i have been working upon there was never any mystery in the matter though as i said yesterday some of the details are of interest the only drawback is that there is no law i fear that can touch the scoundrel  who was he then and what was his object in deserting miss sutherland  the question was hardly out of my mouth and holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door  this is the girls stepfather mr james windibank said holmes he has written to me to say that he would be here at six come in  the man who entered was a sturdy middlesized fellow some thirty years of age cleanshaven and sallowskinned with a bland insinuating manner and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes he shot a questioning glance at each of us placed his shiny tophat upon the sideboard and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair  goodevening mr james windibank said holmes i think that this typewritten letter is from you in which you made an appointment with me for six oclock  yes sir i am afraid that i am a little late but i am not quite my own master you know i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public it was quite against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point of course i did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel  on the contrary said holmes quietly i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr hosmer angel  mr windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves i am delighted to hear it he said  it is a curious thing remarked holmes that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a mans handwriting unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike some letters get more worn than others and some wear only on one side now you remark in this note of yours mr windibank that in every case there is some little slurring over of the e and a slight defect in the tail of the r there are fourteen other characteristics but those are the more obvious  we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office and no doubt it is a little worn our visitor answered glancing keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes  and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study mr windibank holmes continued i think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention i have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man they are all typewritten in each case not only are the es slurred and the rs tailless but you will observe if you care to use my magnifying lens that the fourteen other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well  mr windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat i cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk mr holmes he said if you can catch the man catch him and let me know when you have done it  certainly said holmes stepping over and turning the key in the door i let you know then that i have caught him  what where shouted mr windibank turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap  oh it wont doreally it wont said holmes suavely there is no possible getting out of it mr windibank it is quite too transparent and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question thats right sit down and let us talk it over  our visitor collapsed into a chair with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow itits not actionable he stammered  i am very much afraid that it is not but between ourselves windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me now let me just run over the course of events and you will contradict me if i go wrong  the man sat huddled up in his chair with his head sunk upon his breast like one who is utterly crushed holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and leaning back with his hands in his pockets began talking rather to himself as it seemed than to us  the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money said he and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them it was a considerable sum for people in their position and the loss of it would have made a serious difference it was worth an effort to preserve it the daughter was of a good amiable disposition but affectionate and warmhearted in her ways so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages and her little income she would not be allowed to remain single long now her marriage would mean of course the loss of a hundred a year so what does her stepfather do to prevent it he takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age but soon he found that that would not answer forever she became restive insisted upon her rights and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball what does her clever stepfather do then he conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart with the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper and doubly secure on account of the girls short sight he appears as mr hosmer angel and keeps off other lovers by making love himself  it was only a joke at first groaned our visitor we never thought that she would have been so carried away  very likely not however that may be the young lady was very decidedly carried away and having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind she was flattered by the gentlemans attentions and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother then mr angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced there were meetings and an engagement which would finally secure the girls affections from turning towards anyone else but the deception could not be kept up forever these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young ladys mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding james windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel and so uncertain as to his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not listen to another man as far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a fourwheeler and out at the other i think that was the chain of events mr windibank  our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had been talking and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face  it may be so or it may not mr holmes said he but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now and not me i have done nothing actionable from the first but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint  the law cannot as you say touch you said holmes unlocking and throwing open the door yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more if the young lady has a brother or a friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders by jove he continued flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the mans face it is not part of my duties to my client but heres a hunting crop handy and i think i shall just treat myself to he took two swift steps to the whip but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs the heavy hall door banged and from the window we could see mr james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road  theres a coldblooded scoundrel said holmes laughing as he threw himself down into his chair once more that fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and ends on a gallows the case has in some respects been not entirely devoid of interest  i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning i remarked  well of course it was obvious from the first that this mr hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident as far as we could see was the stepfather then the fact that the two men were never together but that the one always appeared when the other was away was suggestive so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice which both hinted at a disguise as did the bushy whiskers my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature which of course inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it you see all these isolated facts together with many minor ones all pointed in the same direction  and how did you verify them  having once spotted my man it was easy to get corroboration i knew the firm for which this man worked having taken the printed description i eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguisethe whiskers the glasses the voice and i sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers i had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter and i wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here as i expected his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects the same post brought me a letter from westhouse & marbank of fenchurch street to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employé james windibank voilà tout  and miss sutherland  if i tell her she will not believe me you may remember the old persian saying there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace and as much knowledge of the world     iv the boscombe valley mystery   we were seated at breakfast one morning my wife and i when the maid brought in a telegram it was from sherlock holmes and ran in this way   have you a couple of days to spare have just been wired for from the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy shall be glad if you will come with me air and scenery perfect leave paddington by the 11 15  what do you say dear said my wife looking across at me will you go  i really dont know what to say i have a fairly long list at present  oh anstruther would do your work for you you have been looking a little pale lately i think that the change would do you good and you are always so interested in mr sherlock holmes cases  i should be ungrateful if i were not seeing what i gained through one of them i answered but if i am to go i must pack at once for i have only half an hour  my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller my wants were few and simple so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my valise rattling away to paddington station sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform his tall gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travellingcloak and closefitting cloth cap  it is really very good of you to come watson said he it makes a considerable difference to me having someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely local aid is always either worthless or else biassed if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets  we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which holmes had brought with him among these he rummaged and read with intervals of notetaking and of meditation until we were past reading then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack  have you heard anything of the case he asked  not a word i have not seen a paper for some days  the london press has not had very full accounts i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars it seems from what i gather to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult  that sounds a little paradoxical  but it is profoundly true singularity is almost invariably a clue the more featureless and commonplace a crime is the more difficult it is to bring it home in this case however they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man  it is a murder then  well it is conjectured to be so i shall take nothing for granted until i have the opportunity of looking personally into it i will explain the state of things to you as far as i have been able to understand it in a very few words  boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross in herefordshire the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr john turner who made his money in australia and returned some years ago to the old country one of the farms which he held that of hatherley was let to mr charles mccarthy who was also an exaustralian the men had known each other in the colonies so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible turner was apparently the richer man so mccarthy became his tenant but still remained it seems upon terms of perfect equality as they were frequently together mccarthy had one son a lad of eighteen and turner had an only daughter of the same age but neither of them had wives living they appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to have led retired lives though both the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the racemeetings of the neighbourhood mccarthy kept two servantsa man and a girl turner had a considerable household some halfdozen at the least that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families now for the facts  on june 3rd that is on monday last mccarthy left his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe pool which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley he had been out with his servingman in the morning at ross and he had told the man that he must hurry as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three from that appointment he never came back alive  from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile and two people saw him as he passed over this ground one was an old woman whose name is not mentioned and the other was william crowder a gamekeeper in the employ of mr turner both these witnesses depose that mr mccarthy was walking alone the gamekeeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr mccarthy pass he had seen his son mr james mccarthy going the same way with a gun under his arm to the best of his belief the father was actually in sight at the time and the son was following him he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred  the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder the gamekeeper lost sight of them the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge a girl of fourteen patience moran who is the daughter of the lodgekeeper of the boscombe valley estate was in one of the woods picking flowers she states that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr mccarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel she heard mr mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight she had hardly said the words when young mr mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodgekeeper he was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the buttend of his sons gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of wilful murder having been returned at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross who have referred the case to the next assizes those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the policecourt  i could hardly imagine a more damning case i remarked if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here  circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing answered holmes thoughtfully it may seem to point very straight to one thing but if you shift your own point of view a little you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different it must be confessed however that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit there are several people in the neighbourhood however and among them miss turner the daughter of the neighbouring landowner who believe in his innocence and who have retained lestrade whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet to work out the case in his interest lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the case to me and hence it is that two middleaged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home  i am afraid said i that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case  there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he answered laughing besides we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr lestrade you know me too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of understanding to take the first example to hand i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the righthand side and yet i question whether mr lestrade would have noted even so selfevident a thing as that  how on earth  my dear fellow i know you well i know the military neatness which characterises you you shave every morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference therein lies my métier and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest and which are worth considering  what are they  it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after the return to hatherley farm on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroners jury  it was a confession i ejaculated  no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence  coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark  on the contrary said holmes it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds however innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him had he appeared surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable selfrestraint and firmness as to his remark about his deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and even according to the little girl whose evidence is so important to raise his hand as if to strike him the selfreproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one  i shook my head many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence i remarked  so they have and many men have been wrongfully hanged  what is the young mans own account of the matter  it is i am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive you will find it here and may read it for yourself  he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully it ran in this way   mr james mccarthy the only son of the deceased was then called and gave evidence as follows  i had been away from home for three days at bristol and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday the 3rd my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and looking out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though i was not aware in which direction he was going i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side on my way i saw william crowder the gamekeeper as he had stated in his evidence but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father i had no idea that he was in front of me when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of cooee which was a usual signal between my father and myself i then hurried forward and found him standing by the pool he appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows for my father was a man of a very violent temper seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable i left him and returned towards hatherley farm i had not gone more than 150 yards however when i heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me to run back again i found my father expiring upon the ground with his head terribly injured i dropped my gun and held him in my arms but he almost instantly expired i knelt beside him for some minutes and then made my way to mr turners lodgekeeper his house being the nearest to ask for assistance i saw no one near my father when i returned and i have no idea how he came by his injuries he was not a popular man being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners but he had as far as i know no active enemies i know nothing further of the matter  the coroner  did your father make any statement to you before he died  witness  he mumbled a few words but i could only catch some allusion to a rat  the coroner  what did you understand by that  witness  it conveyed no meaning to me i thought that he was delirious  the coroner  what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel  witness  i should prefer not to answer  the coroner  i am afraid that i must press it  witness  it is really impossible for me to tell you i can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed  the coroner  that is for the court to decide i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise  witness  i must still refuse  the coroner  i understand that the cry of cooee was a common signal between you and your father  witness  it was  the coroner  how was it then that he uttered it before he saw you and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol  witness with considerable confusion  i do not know  a juryman  did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured  witness  nothing definite  the coroner  what do you mean  witness  i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into the open that i could think of nothing except of my father yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me it seemed to me to be something grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps when i rose from my father i looked round for it but it was gone  do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help  yes it was gone  you cannot say what it was  no i had a feeling something was there  how far from the body  a dozen yards or so  and how far from the edge of the wood  about the same  then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it  yes but with my back towards it  this concluded the examination of the witness  i see said i as i glanced down the column that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy he calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and his singular account of his fathers dying words they are all as he remarks very much against the son  holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat both you and the coroner have been at some pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the young mans favour dont you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying reference to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth no sir i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us and now here is my pocket petrarch and not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action we lunch at swindon and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes  it was nearly four oclock when we at last after passing through the beautiful stroud valley and over the broad gleaming severn found ourselves at the pretty little countrytown of ross a lean ferretlike man furtive and slylooking was waiting for us upon the platform in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leatherleggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade of scotland yard with him we drove to the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us  i have ordered a carriage said lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea i knew your energetic nature and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime  it was very nice and complimentary of you holmes answered it is entirely a question of barometric pressure  lestrade looked startled i do not quite follow he said  how is the glass twentynine i see no wind and not a cloud in the sky i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination i do not think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage tonight  lestrade laughed indulgently you have no doubt already formed your conclusions from the newspapers he said the case is as plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes still of course one cant refuse a lady and such a very positive one too she has heard of you and would have your opinion though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done why bless my soul here is her carriage at the door  he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life her violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern  oh mr sherlock holmes she cried glancing from one to the other of us and finally with a womans quick intuition fastening upon my companion i am so glad that you have come i have driven down to tell you so i know that james didnt do it i know it and i want you to start upon your work knowing it too never let yourself doubt upon that point we have known each other since we were little children and i know his faults as no one else does but he is too tenderhearted to hurt a fly such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him  i hope we may clear him miss turner said sherlock holmes you may rely upon my doing all that i can  but you have read the evidence you have formed some conclusion do you not see some loophole some flaw do you not yourself think that he is innocent  i think that it is very probable  there now she cried throwing back her head and looking defiantly at lestrade you hear he gives me hopes  lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions he said  but he is right oh i know that he is right james never did it and about his quarrel with his father i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in it  in what way asked holmes  it is no time for me to hide anything james and his father had many disagreements about me mr mccarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet andandwell he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet so there were quarrels and this i am sure was one of them  and your father asked holmes was he in favour of such a union  no he was averse to it also no one but mr mccarthy was in favour of it a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her  thank you for this information said he may i see your father if i call tomorrow  i am afraid the doctor wont allow it  the doctor  yes have you not heard poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down completely he has taken to his bed and dr willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered mr mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in victoria  ha in victoria that is important  yes at the mines  quite so at the goldmines where as i understand mr turner made his money  yes certainly  thank you miss turner you have been of material assistance to me  you will tell me if you have any news tomorrow no doubt you will go to the prison to see james oh if you do mr holmes do tell him that i know him to be innocent  i will miss turner  i must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if i leave him goodbye and god help you in your undertaking she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street  i am ashamed of you holmes said lestrade with dignity after a few minutes silence why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint i am not overtender of heart but i call it cruel  i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy said holmes have you an order to see him in prison  yes but only for you and me  then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him tonight  ample  then let us do so watson i fear that you will find it very slow but i shall only be away a couple of hours  i walked down to the station with them and then wandered through the streets of the little town finally returning to the hotel where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellowbacked novel the puny plot of the story was so thin however when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping and i found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact that i at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day supposing that this unhappy young mans story were absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father and the moment when drawn back by his screams he rushed into the glade it was something terrible and deadly what could it be might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts i rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper which contained a verbatim account of the inquest in the surgeons deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon i marked the spot upon my own head clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind that was to some extent in favour of the accused as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father still it did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell still it might be worth while to call holmes attention to it then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat what could that mean it could not be delirium a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious no it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate but what could it indicate i cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation and then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy if that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress presumably his overcoat in his flight and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off what a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was i did not wonder at lestrades opinion and yet i had so much faith in sherlock holmes insight that i could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young mccarthys innocence  it was late before sherlock holmes returned he came back alone for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town  the glass still keeps very high he remarked as he sat down it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground on the other hand a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that and i did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey i have seen young mccarthy  and what did you learn from him  nothing  could he throw no light  none at all i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her but i am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else he is not a very quickwitted youth though comely to look at and i should think sound at heart  i cannot admire his taste i remarked if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss turner  ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale this fellow is madly insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away five years at a boardingschool what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office no one knows a word of the matter but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows to be absolutely impossible it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father at their last interview was goading him on to propose to miss turner on the other hand he had no means of supporting himself and his father who was by all accounts a very hard man would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in bristol and his father did not know where he was mark that point it is of importance good has come out of evil however for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the bermuda dockyard so that there is really no tie between them i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all that he has suffered  but if he is innocent who has done it  ah who i would call your attention very particularly to two points one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry cooee before he knew that his son had returned those are the crucial points upon which the case depends and now let us talk about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matters until tomorrow  there was no rain as holmes had foretold and the morning broke bright and cloudless at nine oclock lestrade called for us with the carriage and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool  there is serious news this morning lestrade observed it is said that mr turner of the hall is so ill that his life is despaired of  an elderly man i presume said holmes  about sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad and he has been in failing health for some time this business has had a very bad effect upon him he was an old friend of mccarthys and i may add a great benefactor to him for i have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free  indeed that is interesting said holmes  oh yes in a hundred other ways he has helped him everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him  really does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have been under such obligations to turner should still talk of marrying his son to turners daughter who is presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow it is the more strange since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea the daughter told us as much do you not deduce something from that  we have got to the deductions and the inferences said lestrade winking at me i find it hard enough to tackle facts holmes without flying away after theories and fancies  you are right said holmes demurely you do find it very hard to tackle the facts  anyhow i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of replied lestrade with some warmth  and that is  that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine  well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog said holmes laughing but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left  yes that is it it was a widespread comfortablelooking building twostoried slateroofed with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys however gave it a stricken look as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it we called at the door when the maid at holmes request showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the sons though not the pair which he had then had having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points holmes desired to be led to the courtyard from which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool  sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have failed to recognise him his face flushed and darkened his brows were drawn into two hard black lines while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter his face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips compressed and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long sinewy neck his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoked a quick impatient snarl in reply swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool it was damp marshy ground as is all that district and there were marks of many feet both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side sometimes holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow lestrade and i walked behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end  the boscombe pool which is a little reedgirt sheet of water some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr turner above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowners dwelling on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found and indeed so moist was the ground that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man to holmes as i could see by his eager face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass he ran round like a dog who is picking up a scent and then turned upon my companion  what did you go into the pool for he asked  i fished about with a rake i thought there might be some weapon or other trace but how on earth  oh tut tut i have no time that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place a mole could trace it and there it vanishes among the reeds oh how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it here is where the party with the lodgekeeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body but here are three separate tracks of the same feet he drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view talking all the time rather to himself than to us these are young mccarthys feet twice he was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible that bears out his story he ran when he saw his father on the ground then here are the fathers feet as he paced up and down what is this then it is the buttend of the gun as the son stood listening and this ha ha what have we here tiptoes tiptoes square too quite unusual boots they come they go they come againof course that was for the cloak now where did they come from he ran up and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction for a long time he remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach a jagged stone was lying among the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the high road where all traces were lost  it has been a case of considerable interest he remarked returning to his natural manner i fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge i think that i will go in and have a word with moran and perhaps write a little note having done that we may drive back to our luncheon you may walk to the cab and i shall be with you presently  it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into ross holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood  this may interest you lestrade he remarked holding it out the murder was done with it  i see no marks  there are none  how do you know then  the grass was growing under it it had only lain there a few days there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken it corresponds with the injuries there is no sign of any other weapon  and the murderer  is a tall man lefthanded limps with the right leg wears thicksoled shootingboots and a grey cloak smokes indian cigars uses a cigarholder and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket there are several other indications but these may be enough to aid us in our search  lestrade laughed i am afraid that i am still a sceptic he said theories are all very well but we have to deal with a hardheaded british jury  nous verrons answered holmes calmly you work your own method and i shall work mine i shall be busy this afternoon and shall probably return to london by the evening train  and leave your case unfinished  no finished  but the mystery  it is solved  who was the criminal then  the gentleman i describe  but who is he  surely it would not be difficult to find out this is not such a populous neighbourhood  lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am a practical man he said and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a lefthanded gentleman with a game leg i should become the laughingstock of scotland yard  all right said holmes quietly i have given you the chance here are your lodgings goodbye i shall drop you a line before i leave  having left lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where we found lunch upon the table holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face as one who finds himself in a perplexing position  look here watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little i dont know quite what to do and i should value your advice light a cigar and let me expound   pray do so  well now in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthys narrative which struck us both instantly although they impressed me in his favour and you against him one was the fact that his father should according to his account cry cooee before seeing him the other was his singular dying reference to a rat he mumbled several words you understand but that was all that caught the sons ear now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true  what of this cooee then  well obviously it could not have been meant for the son the son as far as he knew was in bristol it was mere chance that he was within earshot the cooee was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with but cooee is a distinctly australian cry and one which is used between australians there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia  what of the rat then  sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table this is a map of the colony of victoria he said i wired to bristol for it last night he put his hand over part of the map what do you read  arat i read  and now he raised his hand  ballarat  quite so that was the word the man uttered and of which his son only caught the last two syllables he was trying to utter the name of his murderer so and so of ballarat  it is wonderful i exclaimed  it is obvious and now you see i had narrowed the field down considerably the possession of a grey garment was a third point which granting the sons statement to be correct was a certainty we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak  certainly  and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly wander  quite so  then comes our expedition of today by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal  but how did you gain them  you know my method it is founded upon the observation of trifles  his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride his boots too might be told from their traces  yes they were peculiar boots  but his lameness  the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left he put less weight upon it why because he limpedhe was lame  but his lefthandedness  you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest the blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side now how can that be unless it were by a lefthanded man he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son he had even smoked there i found the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian cigar i have as you know devoted some attention to this and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco having found the ash i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it it was an indian cigar of the variety which are rolled in rotterdam  and the cigarholder  i could see that the end had not been in his mouth therefore he used a holder the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one so i deduced a blunt penknife  holmes i said you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him i see the direction in which all this points the culprit is  mr john turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of our sittingroom and ushering in a visitor  the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure his slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude and yet his hard deeplined craggy features and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character his tangled beard grizzled hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an ashen white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue it was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease  pray sit down on the sofa said holmes gently you had my note  yes the lodgekeeper brought it up you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal  i thought people would talk if i went to the hall  and why did you wish to see me he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question was already answered  yes said holmes answering the look rather than the words it is so i know all about mccarthy  the old man sank his face in his hands god help me he cried but i would not have let the young man come to harm i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes  i am glad to hear you say so said holmes gravely  i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl it would break her heartit will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested  it may not come to that said holmes  what  i am no official agent i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here and i am acting in her interests young mccarthy must be got off however  i am a dying man said old turner i have had diabetes for years my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol  holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him just tell us the truth he said i shall jot down the facts you will sign it and watson here can witness it then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young mccarthy i promise you that i shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed  its as well said the old man its a question whether i shall live to the assizes so it matters little to me but i should wish to spare alice the shock and now i will make the thing clear to you it has been a long time in the acting but will not take me long to tell  you didnt know this dead man mccarthy he was a devil incarnate i tell you that god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he his grip has been upon me these twenty years and he has blasted my life ill tell you first how i came to be in his power  it was in the early 60s at the diggings i was a young chap then hotblooded and reckless ready to turn my hand at anything i got among bad companions took to drink had no luck with my claim took to the bush and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber there were six of us and we had a wild free life of it sticking up a station from time to time or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings black jack of ballarat was the name i went under and our party is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang  one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne and we lay in wait for it and attacked it there were six troopers and six of us so it was a close thing but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley three of our boys were killed however before we got the swag i put my pistol to the head of the wagondriver who was this very man mccarthy i wish to the lord that i had shot him then but i spared him though i saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face as though to remember every feature we got away with the gold became wealthy men and made our way over to england without being suspected there i parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life i bought this estate which chanced to be in the market and i set myself to do a little good with my money to make up for the way in which i had earned it i married too and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done in a word i turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past all was going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me  i had gone up to town about an investment and i met him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot  here we are jack says he touching me on the arm well be as good as a family to you theres two of us me and my son and you can have the keeping of us if you dontits a fine lawabiding country is england and theres always a policeman within hail  well down they came to the west country there was no shaking them off and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since there was no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness turn where i would there was his cunning grinning face at my elbow it grew worse as alice grew up for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police whatever he wanted he must have and whatever it was i gave him without question land money houses until at last he asked a thing which i could not give he asked for alice  his son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as i was known to be in weak health it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property but there i was firm i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine not that i had any dislike to the lad but his blood was in him and that was enough i stood firm mccarthy threatened i braved him to do his worst we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over  when i went down there i found him talking with his son so i smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this could i not snap the bond i was already a dying and a desperate man though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb i knew that my own fate was sealed but my memory and my girl both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue i did it mr holmes i would do it again deeply as i have sinned i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it but that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than i could suffer i struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast his cry brought back his son but i had gained the cover of the wood though i was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight that is the true story gentlemen of all that occurred  well it is not for me to judge you said holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out i pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation  i pray not sir and what do you intend to do  in view of your health nothing you are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes i will keep your confession and if mccarthy is condemned i shall be forced to use it if not it shall never be seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us  farewell then said the old man solemnly your own deathbeds when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine tottering and shaking in all his giant frame he stumbled slowly from the room  god help us said holmes after a long silence why does fate play such tricks with poor helpless worms i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxters words and say there but for the grace of god goes sherlock holmes  james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and submitted to the defending counsel old turner lived for seven months after our interview but he is now dead and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past     v the five orange pips   when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes cases between the years 82 and 90 i am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave some however have already gained publicity through the papers and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate some too have baffled his analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him there is however one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been and probably never will be entirely cleared up  the year 87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest of which i retain the records among my headings under this one twelve months i find an account of the adventure of the paradol chamber of the amateur mendicant society who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse of the facts connected with the loss of the british barque sophy anderson of the singular adventures of the grice patersons in the island of uffa and finally of the camberwell poisoning case in the latter as may be remembered sherlock holmes was able by winding up the dead mans watch to prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that timea deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case all these i may sketch out at some future date but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe  it was in the latter days of september and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence all day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that even here in the heart of great handmade london we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation like untamed beasts in a cage as evening drew in the storm grew higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace crossindexing his records of crime while i at the other was deep in one of clark russells fine seastories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves my wife was on a visit to her mothers and for a few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker street  why said i glancing up at my companion that was surely the bell who could come tonight some friend of yours perhaps  except yourself i have none he answered i do not encourage visitors  a client then  if so it is a serious case nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour but i take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landladys  sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door he stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit  come in said he  the man who entered was young some twoandtwenty at the outside wellgroomed and trimly clad with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing the streaming umbrella which he held in his hand and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come he looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp and i could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety  i owe you an apology he said raising his golden pincenez to his eyes i trust that i am not intruding i fear that i have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber  give me your coat and umbrella said holmes they may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently you have come up from the southwest i see  yes from horsham  that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive  i have come for advice  that is easily got  and help  that is not always so easy  i have heard of you mr holmes i heard from major prendergast how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal  ah of course he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards  he said that you could solve anything  he said too much  that you are never beaten  i have been beaten four timesthree times by men and once by a woman  but what is that compared with the number of your successes  it is true that i have been generally successful  then you may be so with me  i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case  it is no ordinary one  none of those which come to me are i am the last court of appeal  and yet i question sir whether in all your experience you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family  you fill me with interest said holmes pray give us the essential facts from the commencement and i can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important  the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze  my name said he is john openshaw but my own affairs have as far as i can understand little to do with this awful business it is a hereditary matter so in order to give you an idea of the facts i must go back to the commencement of the affair  you must know that my grandfather had two sonsmy uncle elias and my father joseph my father had a small factory at coventry which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling he was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence  my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and became a planter in florida where he was reported to have done very well at the time of the war he fought in jacksons army and afterwards under hood where he rose to be a colonel when lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation where he remained for three or four years about 1869 or 1870 he came back to europe and took a small estate in sussex near horsham he had made a very considerable fortune in the states and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to them he was a singular man fierce and quicktempered very foulmouthed when he was angry and of a most retiring disposition during all the years that he lived at horsham i doubt if ever he set foot in the town he had a garden and two or three fields round his house and there he would take his exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room he drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily but he would see no society and did not want any friends not even his own brother  he didnt mind me in fact he took a fancy to me for at the time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so this would be in the year 1878 after he had been eight or nine years in england he begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way when he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite master of the house i kept all the keys and could go where i liked and do what i liked so long as i did not disturb him in his privacy there was one singular exception however for he had a single room a lumberroom up among the attics which was invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter with a boys curiosity i have peeped through the keyhole but i was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room  one dayit was in march 1883a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonels plate it was not a common thing for him to receive letters for his bills were all paid in ready money and he had no friends of any sort from india said he as he took it up pondicherry postmark what can this be opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little dried orange pips which pattered down upon his plate i began to laugh at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face his lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand k k k he shrieked and then my god my god my sins have overtaken me  what is it uncle i cried  death said he and rising from the table he retired to his room leaving me palpitating with horror i took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the gum the letter k three times repeated there was nothing else save the five dried pips what could be the reason of his overpowering terror i left the breakfasttable and as i ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key which must have belonged to the attic in one hand and a small brass box like a cashbox in the other  they may do what they like but ill checkmate them still said he with an oath tell mary that i shall want a fire in my room today and send down to fordham the horsham lawyer  i did as he ordered and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step up to the room the fire was burning brightly and in the grate there was a mass of black fluffy ashes as of burned paper while the brass box stood open and empty beside it as i glanced at the box i noticed with a start that upon the lid was printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the envelope  i wish you john said my uncle to witness my will i leave my estate with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my brother your father whence it will no doubt descend to you if you can enjoy it in peace well and good if you find you cannot take my advice my boy and leave it to your deadliest enemy i am sorry to give you such a twoedged thing but i cant say what turn things are going to take kindly sign the paper where mr fordham shows you  i signed the paper as directed and the lawyer took it away with him the singular incident made as you may think the deepest impression upon me and i pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it yet i could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives i could see a change in my uncle however he drank more than ever and he was less inclined for any sort of society most of his time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil when these hot fits were over however he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul at such times i have seen his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it were new raised from a basin  well to come to an end of the matter mr holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back we found him when we went to search for him face downward in a little greenscummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden there was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity brought in a verdict of suicide but i who knew how he winced from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it the matter passed however and my father entered into possession of the estate and of some £ 14000 which lay to his credit at the bank  one moment holmes interposed your statement is i foresee one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and the date of his supposed suicide  the letter arrived on march 10 1883 his death was seven weeks later upon the night of may 2nd  thank you pray proceed  when my father took over the horsham property he at my request made a careful examination of the attic which had been always locked up we found the brass box there although its contents had been destroyed on the inside of the cover was a paper label with the initials of k k k repeated upon it and letters memoranda receipts and a register written beneath these we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw for the rest there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and notebooks bearing upon my uncles life in america some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpetbag politicians who had been sent down from the north  well it was the beginning of 84 when my father came to live at horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the january of 85 on the fourth day after the new year i heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfasttable there he was sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one he had always laughed at what he called my cockandbull story about the colonel but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself  why what on earth does this mean john he stammered  my heart had turned to lead it is k k k said i  he looked inside the envelope so it is he cried here are the very letters but what is this written above them  put the papers on the sundial i read peeping over his shoulder  what papers what sundial he asked  the sundial in the garden there is no other said i but the papers must be those that are destroyed  pooh said he gripping hard at his courage we are in a civilised land here and we cant have tomfoolery of this kind where does the thing come from  from dundee i answered glancing at the postmark  some preposterous practical joke said he what have i to do with sundials and papers i shall take no notice of such nonsense  i should certainly speak to the police i said  and be laughed at for my pains nothing of the sort  then let me do so  no i forbid you i wont have a fuss made about such nonsense  it was in vain to argue with him for he was a very obstinate man i went about however with a heart which was full of forebodings  on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his major freebody who is in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill i was glad that he should go for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home in that however i was in error upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram from the major imploring me to come at once my father had fallen over one of the deep chalkpits which abound in the neighbourhood and was lying senseless with a shattered skull i hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness he had as it appears been returning from fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him and the chalkpit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of death from accidental causes carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death i was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder there were no signs of violence no footmarks no robbery no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease and that i was wellnigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him  in this sinister way i came into my inheritance you will ask me why i did not dispose of it i answer because i was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncles life and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another  it was in january 85 that my poor father met his end and two years and eight months have elapsed since then during that time i have lived happily at horsham and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family and that it had ended with the last generation i had begun to take comfort too soon however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father  the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips  this is the envelope he continued the postmark is londoneastern division within are the very words which were upon my fathers last message  k k k and then put the papers on the sundial  what have you done asked holmes  nothing  nothing  to tell the truthhe sank his face into his thin white handsi have felt helpless i have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight and no precautions can guard against  tut tut cried sherlock holmes you must act man or you are lost nothing but energy can save you this is no time for despair  i have seen the police  ah  but they listened to my story with a smile i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with the warnings  holmes shook his clenched hands in the air incredible imbecility he cried  they have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in the house with me  has he come with you tonight  no his orders were to stay in the house  again holmes raved in the air  why did you come to me he said and above all why did you not come at once  i did not know it was only today that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you  it is really two days since you had the letter we should have acted before this you have no further evidence i suppose than that which you have placed before usno suggestive detail which might help us  there is one thing said john openshaw he rummaged in his coat pocket and drawing out a piece of discoloured bluetinted paper he laid it out upon the table i have some remembrance said he that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from among the others and in that way has escaped destruction beyond the mention of pips i do not see that it helps us much i think myself that it is a page from some private diary the writing is undoubtedly my uncles  holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book it was headed march 1869 and beneath were the following enigmatical notices   4th hudson came same old platform  7th set the pips on mccauley paramore and john swain of st augustine  9th mccauley cleared  10th john swain cleared  12th visited paramore all well  thank you said holmes folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor and now you must on no account lose another instant we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me you must get home instantly and act  what shall i do  there is but one thing to do it must be done at once you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them having done this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed do you understand  entirely  do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present i think that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our web to weave while theirs is already woven the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties  i thank you said the young man rising and pulling on his overcoat you have given me fresh life and hope i shall certainly do as you advise  do not lose an instant and above all take care of yourself in the meanwhile for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger how do you go back  by train from waterloo  it is not yet nine the streets will be crowded so i trust that you may be in safety and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely  i am armed  that is well tomorrow i shall set to work upon your case  i shall see you at horsham then  no your secret lies in london it is there that i shall seek it  then i shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news as to the box and the papers i shall take your advice in every particular he shook hands with us and took his leave outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows this strange wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elementsblown in upon us like a sheet of seaweed in a galeand now to have been reabsorbed by them once more  sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire then he lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smokerings as they chased each other up to the ceiling  i think watson he remarked at last that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this  save perhaps the sign of four  well yes save perhaps that and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos  but have you i asked formed any definite conception as to what these perils are  there can be no question as to their nature he answered  then what are they who is this k k k and why does he pursue this unhappy family  sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair with his fingertips together the ideal reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones both before and after we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses to carry the art however to its highest pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclopædias is a somewhat rare accomplishment it is not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have endeavoured in my case to do if i remember rightly you on one occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits in a very precise fashion  yes i answered laughing it was a singular document philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero i remember botany variable geology profound as regards the mudstains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime records unique violinplayer boxer swordsman lawyer and selfpoisoner by cocaine and tobacco those i think were the main points of my analysis  holmes grinned at the last item well he said i say now as i said then that a man should keep his little brainattic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumberroom of his library where he can get it if he wants it now for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us tonight we need certainly to muster all our resources kindly hand me down the letter k of the american encyclopædia which stands upon the shelf beside you thank you now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it in the first place we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from america as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors did you remark the postmarks of those letters  the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the third from london  from east london what do you deduce from that  they are all seaports that the writer was on board of a ship  excellent we have already a clue there can be no doubt that the probabilitythe strong probabilityis that the writer was on board of a ship and now let us consider another point in the case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days does that suggest anything  a greater distance to travel  but the letter had also a greater distance to come  then i do not see the point  there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailingship it looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mailboat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer  it is possible  more than that it is probable and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why i urged young openshaw to caution the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance but this one comes from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay  good god i cried what can it mean this relentless persecution  the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailingship i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroners jury there must have been several in it and they must have been men of resource and determination their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may in this way you see k k k ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society  but of what society  have you never said sherlock holmes bending forward and sinking his voicehave you never heard of the ku klux klan  i never have  holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee here it is said he presently   ku klux klan a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle this terrible secret society was formed by some exconfederate soldiers in the southern states after the civil war and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country notably in tennessee louisiana the carolinas georgia and florida its power was used for political purposes principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shapea sprig of oakleaves in some parts melon seeds or orange pips in others on receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might fly from the country if he braved the matter out death would unfailingly come upon him and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner so perfect was the organisation of the society and so systematic its methods that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators for some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the united states government and of the better classes of the community in the south eventually in the year 1869 the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date  you will observe said holmes laying down the volume that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers it may well have been cause and effect it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered  then the page we have seen  is such as we might expect it ran if i remember right sent the pips to a b and cthat is sent the societys warning to them then there are successive entries that a and b cleared or left the country and finally that c was visited with i fear a sinister result for c well i think doctor that we may let some light into this dark place and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have told him there is nothing more to be said or to be done tonight so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men  it had cleared in the morning and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came down  you will excuse me for not waiting for you said he i have i foresee a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young openshaws  what steps will you take i asked  it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries i may have to go down to horsham after all  you will not go there first  no i shall commence with the city just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee  as i waited i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it it rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart  holmes i cried you are too late  ah said he laying down his cup i feared as much how was it done he spoke calmly but i could see that he was deeply moved  my eye caught the name of openshaw and the heading tragedy near waterloo bridge here is the account   between nine and ten last night policeconstable cook of the h division on duty near waterloo bridge heard a cry for help and a splash in the water the night however was extremely dark and stormy so that in spite of the help of several passersby it was quite impossible to effect a rescue the alarm however was given and by the aid of the waterpolice the body was eventually recovered it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket was john openshaw and whose residence is near horsham it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landingplaces for river steamboats the body exhibited no traces of violence and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landingstages  we sat in silence for some minutes holmes more depressed and shaken than i had ever seen him  that hurts my pride watson he said at last it is a petty feeling no doubt but it hurts my pride it becomes a personal matter with me now and if god sends me health i shall set my hand upon this gang that he should come to me for help and that i should send him away to his death he sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands  they must be cunning devils he exclaimed at last how could they have decoyed him down there the embankment is not on the direct line to the station the bridge no doubt was too crowded even on such a night for their purpose well watson we shall see who will win in the long run i am going out now  to the police  no i shall be my own police when i have spun the web they may take the flies but not before  all day i was engaged in my professional work and it was late in the evening before i returned to baker street sherlock holmes had not come back yet it was nearly ten oclock before he entered looking pale and worn he walked up to the sideboard and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously washing it down with a long draught of water  you are hungry i remarked  starving it had escaped my memory i have had nothing since breakfast  nothing  not a bite i had no time to think of it  and how have you succeeded  well  you have a clue  i have them in the hollow of my hand young openshaw shall not long remain unavenged why watson let us put their own devilish trademark upon them it is well thought of  what do you mean  he took an orange from the cupboard and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope on the inside of the flap he wrote s h for j o then he sealed it and addressed it to captain james calhoun barque lone star savannah georgia  that will await him when he enters port said he chuckling it may give him a sleepless night he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him  and who is this captain calhoun  the leader of the gang i shall have the others but he first  how did you trace it then  he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket all covered with dates and names  i have spent the whole day said he over lloyds registers and files of the old papers following the future career of every vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in 83 there were thirtysix ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months of these one the lone star instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported as having cleared from london the name is that which is given to one of the states of the union  texas i think  i was not and am not sure which but i knew that the ship must have an american origin  what then  i searched the dundee records and when i found that the barque lone star was there in january 85 my suspicion became a certainty i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london  yes  the lone star had arrived here last week i went down to the albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning homeward bound to savannah i wired to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight  what will you do then  oh i have my hand upon him he and the two mates are as i learn the only nativeborn americans in the ship the others are finns and germans i know also that they were all three away from the ship last night i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo by the time that their sailingship reaches savannah the mailboat will have carried this letter and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder  there is ever a flaw however in the best laid of human plans and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as resolute as themselves was upon their track very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year we waited long for news of the lone star of savannah but none ever reached us we did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a shattered sternpost of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave with the letters l s carved upon it and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the lone star     vi the man with the twisted lip   isa whitney brother of the late elias whitney dd principal of the theological college of st georges was much addicted to opium the habit grew upon him as i understand from some foolish freak when he was at college for having read de quinceys description of his dreams and sensations he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects he found as so many more have done that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives i can see him now with yellow pasty face drooping lids and pinpoint pupils all huddled in a chair the wreck and ruin of a noble man  one nightit was in june 89there came a ring to my bell about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock i sat up in my chair and my wife laid her needlework down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment  a patient said she youll have to go out  i groaned for i was newly come back from a weary day  we heard the door open a few hurried words and then quick steps upon the linoleum our own door flew open and a lady clad in some darkcoloured stuff with a black veil entered the room  you will excuse my calling so late she began and then suddenly losing her selfcontrol she ran forward threw her arms about my wifes neck and sobbed upon her shoulder oh im in such trouble she cried i do so want a little help  why said my wife pulling up her veil it is kate whitney how you startled me kate i had not an idea who you were when you came in  i didnt know what to do so i came straight to you that was always the way folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse  it was very sweet of you to come now you must have some wine and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it or should you rather that i sent james off to bed  oh no no i want the doctors advice and help too its about isa he has not been home for two days i am so frightened about him  it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husbands trouble to me as a doctor to my wife as an old friend and school companion we soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find did she know where her husband was was it possible that we could bring him back to her  it seems that it was she had the surest information that of late he had when the fit was on him made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the city hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day and he had come back twitching and shattered in the evening but now the spell had been upon him eightandforty hours and he lay there doubtless among the dregs of the docks breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects there he was to be found she was sure of it at the bar of gold in upper swandam lane but what was she to do how could she a young and timid woman make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him  there was the case and of course there was but one way out of it might i not escort her to this place and then as a second thought why should she come at all i was isa whitneys medical adviser and as such i had influence over him i could manage it better if i were alone i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me and so in ten minutes i had left my armchair and cheery sittingroom behind me and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand as it seemed to me at the time though the future only could show how strange it was to be  but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of london bridge between a slopshop and a ginshop approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave i found the den of which i was in search ordering my cab to wait i passed down the steps worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet and by the light of a flickering oillamp above the door i found the latch and made my way into a long low room thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke and terraced with wooden berths like the forecastle of an emigrant ship  through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses bowed shoulders bent knees heads thrown back and chins pointing upward with here and there a dark lacklustre eye turned upon the newcomer out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light now bright now faint as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes the most lay silent but some muttered to themselves and others talked together in a strange low monotonous voice their conversation coming in gushes and then suddenly tailing off into silence each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour at the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal beside which on a threelegged wooden stool there sat a tall thin old man with his jaw resting upon his two fists and his elbows upon his knees staring into the fire  as i entered a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug beckoning me to an empty berth  thank you i have not come to stay said i there is a friend of mine here mr isa whitney and i wish to speak with him  there was a movement and an exclamation from my right and peering through the gloom i saw whitney pale haggard and unkempt staring out at me  my god its watson said he he was in a pitiable state of reaction with every nerve in a twitter i say watson what oclock is it  nearly eleven  of what day  of friday june 19th  good heavens i thought it was wednesday it is wednesday what dyou want to frighten a chap for he sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key  i tell you that it is friday man your wife has been waiting this two days for you you should be ashamed of yourself  so i am but youve got mixed watson for i have only been here a few hours three pipes four pipesi forget how many but ill go home with you i wouldnt frighten katepoor little kate give me your hand have you a cab  yes i have one waiting  then i shall go in it but i must owe something find what i owe watson i am all off colour i can do nothing for myself  i walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers holding my breath to keep out the vile stupefying fumes of the drug and looking about for the manager as i passed the tall man who sat by the brazier i felt a sudden pluck at my skirt and a low voice whispered walk past me and then look back at me the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear i glanced down they could only have come from the old man at my side and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever very thin very wrinkled bent with age an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers i took two steps forward and looked back it took all my selfcontrol to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment he had turned his back so that none could see him but i his form had filled out his wrinkles were gone the dull eyes had regained their fire and there sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise was none other than sherlock holmes he made a slight motion to me to approach him and instantly as he turned his face half round to the company once more subsided into a doddering looselipped senility  holmes i whispered what on earth are you doing in this den  as low as you can he answered i have excellent ears if you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours i should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you  i have a cab outside  then pray send him home in it you may safely trust him for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief i should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me if you will wait outside i shall be with you in five minutes  it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes requests for they were always so exceedingly definite and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery i felt however that when whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished and for the rest i could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence in a few minutes i had written my note paid whitneys bill led him out to the cab and seen him driven through the darkness in a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den and i was walking down the street with sherlock holmes for two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot then glancing quickly round he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter  i suppose watson said he that you imagine that i have added opiumsmoking to cocaine injections and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views  i was certainly surprised to find you there  but not more so than i to find you  i came to find a friend  and i to find an enemy  an enemy  yes one of my natural enemies or shall i say my natural prey briefly watson i am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots as i have done before now had i been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hours purchase for i have used it before now for my own purposes and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me there is a trapdoor at the back of that building near the corner of pauls wharf which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights  what you do not mean bodies  ay bodies watson we should be rich men if we had £ 1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den it is the vilest murdertrap on the whole riverside and i fear that neville st clair has entered it never to leave it more but our trap should be here he put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrillya signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses hoofs  now watson said holmes as a tall dogcart dashed up through the gloom throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns youll come with me wont you  if i can be of use  oh a trusty comrade is always of use and a chronicler still more so my room at the cedars is a doublebedded one  the cedars  yes that is mr st clairs house i am staying there while i conduct the inquiry  where is it then  near lee in kent we have a sevenmile drive before us  but i am all in the dark  of course you are youll know all about it presently jump up here all right john we shall not need you heres half a crown look out for me tomorrow about eleven give her her head so long then  he flicked the horse with his whip and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets which widened gradually until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar its silence broken only by the heavy regular footfall of the policeman or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds holmes drove in silence with his head sunk upon his breast and the air of a man who is lost in thought while i sat beside him curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts we had driven several miles and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas when he shook himself shrugged his shoulders and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best  you have a grand gift of silence watson said he it makes you quite invaluable as a companion pon my word it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to for my own thoughts are not overpleasant i was wondering what i should say to this dear little woman tonight when she meets me at the door  you forget that i know nothing about it  i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to lee it seems absurdly simple and yet somehow i can get nothing to go upon theres plenty of thread no doubt but i cant get the end of it into my hand now ill state the case clearly and concisely to you watson and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me  proceed then  some years agoto be definite in may 1884there came to lee a gentleman neville st clair by name who appeared to have plenty of money he took a large villa laid out the grounds very nicely and lived generally in good style by degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer by whom he now has two children he had no occupation but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning returning by the 5 14 from cannon street every night mr st clair is now thirtyseven years of age is a man of temperate habits a good husband a very affectionate father and a man who is popular with all who know him i may add that his whole debts at the present moment as far as we have been able to ascertain amount to £ 88 10s while he has £ 220 standing to his credit in the capital and counties bank there is no reason therefore to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind  last monday mr neville st clair went into town rather earlier than usual remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks now by the merest chance his wife received a telegram upon this same monday very shortly after his departure to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the aberdeen shipping company now if you are well up in your london you will know that the office of the company is in fresno street which branches out of upper swandam lane where you found me tonight mrs st clair had her lunch started for the city did some shopping proceeded to the companys office got her packet and found herself at exactly 4 35 walking through swandam lane on her way back to the station have you followed me so far  it is very clear  if you remember monday was an exceedingly hot day and mrs st clair walked slowly glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself while she was walking in this way down swandam lane she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and as it seemed to her beckoning to her from a secondfloor window the window was open and she distinctly saw his face which she describes as being terribly agitated he waved his hands frantically to her and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat such as he had started to town in he had on neither collar nor necktie  convinced that something was amiss with him she rushed down the stepsfor the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me tonightand running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor at the foot of the stairs however she met this lascar scoundrel of whom i have spoken who thrust her back and aided by a dane who acts as assistant there pushed her out into the street filled with the most maddening doubts and fears she rushed down the lane and by rare goodfortune met in fresno street a number of constables with an inspector all on their way to their beat the inspector and two men accompanied her back and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor they made their way to the room in which mr st clair had last been seen there was no sign of him there in fact in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect who it seems made his home there both he and the lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon so determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered and had almost come to believe that mrs st clair had been deluded when with a cry she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it out there fell a cascade of childrens bricks it was the toy which he had promised to bring home  this discovery and the evident confusion which the cripple showed made the inspector realise that the matter was serious the rooms were carefully examined and results all pointed to an abominable crime the front room was plainly furnished as a sittingroom and led into a small bedroom which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below on examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of mr neville st clair with the exception of his coat his boots his socks his hat and his watchall were there there were no signs of violence upon any of these garments and there were no other traces of mr neville st clair out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy  and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents but as by mrs st clairs story he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husbands appearance at the window he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime his defence was one of absolute ignorance and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone his lodger and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentlemans clothes  so much for the lascar manager now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st clair his name is hugh boone and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city he is a professional beggar though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas some little distance down threadneedle street upon the lefthand side there is as you may have remarked a small angle in the wall here it is that this creature takes his daily seat crosslegged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him i have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of making his professional acquaintance and i have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time his appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him a shock of orange hair a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar which by its contraction has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so too does his wit for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passersby this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest  but a cripple said i what could he have done singlehanded against a man in the prime of life  he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and wellnurtured man surely your medical experience would tell you watson that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others  pray continue your narrative  mrs st clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window and she was escorted home in a cab by the police as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations inspector barton who had charge of the case made a very careful examination of the premises but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter one mistake had been made in not arresting boone instantly as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the lascar but this fault was soon remedied and he was seized and searched without anything being found which could incriminate him there were it is true some bloodstains upon his right shirtsleeve but he pointed to his ringfinger which had been cut near the nail and explained that the bleeding came from there adding that he had been to the window not long before and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source he denied strenuously having ever seen mr neville st clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police as to mrs st clairs assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming he was removed loudly protesting to the policestation while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue  and it did though they hardly found upon the mudbank what they had feared to find it was neville st clairs coat and not neville st clair which lay uncovered as the tide receded and what do you think they found in the pockets  i cannot imagine  no i dont think you would guess every pocket stuffed with pennies and halfpennies421 pennies and 270 halfpennies it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide but a human body is a different matter there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house it seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river  but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room would the body be dressed in a coat alone  no sir but the facts might be met speciously enough suppose that this man boone had thrust neville st clair through the window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed what would he do then it would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the telltale garments he would seize the coat then and be in the act of throwing it out when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink he has little time for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street there is not an instant to be lost he rushes to some secret hoard where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coats sinking he throws it out and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared  it certainly sounds feasible  well we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better boone as i have told you was arrested and taken to the station but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him he had for years been known as a professional beggar but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one there the matter stands at present and the questions which have to be solvedwhat neville st clair was doing in the opium den what happened to him when there where is he now and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearanceare all as far from a solution as ever i confess that i cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties  while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of events we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us just as he finished however we drove through two scattered villages where a few lights still glimmered in the windows  we are on the outskirts of lee said my companion we have touched on three english counties in our short drive starting in middlesex passing over an angle of surrey and ending in kent see that light among the trees that is the cedars and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already i have little doubt caught the clink of our horses feet  but why are you not conducting the case from baker street i asked  because there are many inquiries which must be made out here mrs st clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague i hate to meet her watson when i have no news of her husband here we are whoa there whoa  we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds a stableboy had run out to the horses head and springing down i followed holmes up the small winding graveldrive which led to the house as we approached the door flew open and a little blonde woman stood in the opening clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists she stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light one hand upon the door one halfraised in her eagerness her body slightly bent her head and face protruded with eager eyes and parted lips a standing question  well she cried well and then seeing that there were two of us she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders  no good news  none  no bad  no  thank god for that but come in you must be weary for you have had a long day  this is my friend dr watson he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation  i am delighted to see you said she pressing my hand warmly you will i am sure forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us  my dear madam said i i am an old campaigner and if i were not i can very well see that no apology is needed if i can be of any assistance either to you or to my friend here i shall be indeed happy  now mr sherlock holmes said the lady as we entered a welllit diningroom upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out i should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions to which i beg that you will give a plain answer  certainly madam  do not trouble about my feelings i am not hysterical nor given to fainting i simply wish to hear your real real opinion  upon what point  in your heart of hearts do you think that neville is alive  sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question frankly now she repeated standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basketchair  frankly then madam i do not  you think that he is dead  i do  murdered  i dont say that perhaps  and on what day did he meet his death  on monday  then perhaps mr holmes you will be good enough to explain how it is that i have received a letter from him today  sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised  what he roared  yes today she stood smiling holding up a little slip of paper in the air  may i see it  certainly  he snatched it from her in his eagerness and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently i had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder the envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day or rather of the day before for it was considerably after midnight  coarse writing murmured holmes surely this is not your husbands writing madam  no but the enclosure is  i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address  how can you tell that  the name you see is in perfectly black ink which has dried itself the rest is of the greyish colour which shows that blottingpaper has been used if it had been written straight off and then blotted none would be of a deep black shade this man has written the name and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address which can only mean that he was not familiar with it it is of course a trifle but there is nothing so important as trifles let us now see the letter ha there has been an enclosure here  yes there was a ring his signetring  and you are sure that this is your husbands hand  one of his hands  one  his hand when he wrote hurriedly it is very unlike his usual writing and yet i know it well  dearest do not be frightened all will come well there is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify wait in patienceneville written in pencil upon the flyleaf of a book octavo size no watermark hum posted today in gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb ha and the flap has been gummed if i am not very much in error by a person who had been chewing tobacco and you have no doubt that it is your husbands hand madam  none neville wrote those words  and they were posted today at gravesend well mrs st clair the clouds lighten though i should not venture to say that the danger is over  but he must be alive mr holmes  unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent the ring after all proves nothing it may have been taken from him  no no it is it is his very own writing  very well it may however have been written on monday and only posted today  that is possible  if so much may have happened between  oh you must not discourage me mr holmes i know that all is well with him there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if evil came upon him on the very day that i saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom and yet i in the diningroom rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened do you think that i would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death  i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view but if your husband is alive and able to write letters why should he remain away from you  i cannot imagine it is unthinkable  and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you  no  and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane  very much so  was the window open  yes  then he might have called to you  he might  he only as i understand gave an inarticulate cry  yes  a call for help you thought  yes he waved his hands  but it might have been a cry of surprise astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands  it is possible  and you thought he was pulled back  he disappeared so suddenly  he might have leaped back you did not see anyone else in the room  no but this horrible man confessed to having been there and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs  quite so your husband as far as you could see had his ordinary clothes on  but without his collar or tie i distinctly saw his bare throat  had he ever spoken of swandam lane  never  had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium  never  thank you mrs st clair those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear we shall now have a little supper and then retire for we may have a very busy day tomorrow  a large and comfortable doublebedded room had been placed at our disposal and i was quickly between the sheets for i was weary after my night of adventure sherlock holmes was a man however who when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind would go for days and even for a week without rest turning it over rearranging his facts looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient it was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an allnight sitting he took off his coat and waistcoat put on a large blue dressinggown and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs with these he constructed a sort of eastern divan upon which he perched himself crosslegged with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there an old briar pipe between his lips his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling the blue smoke curling up from him silent motionless with the light shining upon his strongset aquiline features so he sat as i dropped off to sleep and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up and i found the summer sun shining into the apartment the pipe was still between his lips the smoke still curled upward and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze but nothing remained of the heap of shag which i had seen upon the previous night  awake watson he asked  yes  game for a morning drive  certainly  then dress no one is stirring yet but i know where the stableboy sleeps and we shall soon have the trap out he chuckled to himself as he spoke his eyes twinkled and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night  as i dressed i glanced at my watch it was no wonder that no one was stirring it was twentyfive minutes past four i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse  i want to test a little theory of mine said he pulling on his boots i think watson that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe i deserve to be kicked from here to charing cross but i think i have the key of the affair now  and where is it i asked smiling  in the bathroom he answered oh yes i am not joking he continued seeing my look of incredulity i have just been there and i have taken it out and i have got it in this gladstone bag come on my boy and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock  we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible and out into the bright morning sunshine in the road stood our horse and trap with the halfclad stableboy waiting at the head we both sprang in and away we dashed down the london road a few country carts were stirring bearing in vegetables to the metropolis but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream  it has been in some points a singular case said holmes flicking the horse on into a gallop i confess that i have been as blind as a mole but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all  in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in bow street sherlock holmes was well known to the force and the two constables at the door saluted him one of them held the horses head while the other led us in  who is on duty asked holmes  inspector bradstreet sir  ah bradstreet how are you a tall stout official had come down the stoneflagged passage in a peaked cap and frogged jacket i wish to have a quiet word with you bradstreet  certainly mr holmes step into my room here  it was a small officelike room with a huge ledger upon the table and a telephone projecting from the wall the inspector sat down at his desk  what can i do for you mr holmes  i called about that beggarman boonethe one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of mr neville st clair of lee  yes he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries  so i heard you have him here  in the cells  is he quiet  oh he gives no trouble but he is a dirty scoundrel  dirty  yes it is all we can do to make him wash his hands and his face is as black as a tinkers well when once his case has been settled he will have a regular prison bath and i think if you saw him you would agree with me that he needed it  i should like to see him very much  would you that is easily done come this way you can leave your bag  no i think that ill take it  very good come this way if you please he led us down a passage opened a barred door passed down a winding stair and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side  the third on the right is his said the inspector here it is he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through  he is asleep said he you can see him very well  we both put our eyes to the grating the prisoner lay with his face towards us in a very deep sleep breathing slowly and heavily he was a middlesized man coarsely clad as became his calling with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat he was as the inspector had said extremely dirty but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness a broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl a shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead  hes a beauty isnt he said the inspector  he certainly needs a wash remarked holmes i had an idea that he might and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke and took out to my astonishment a very large bathsponge  he he you are a funny one chuckled the inspector  now if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure  well i dont know why not said the inspector he doesnt look a credit to the bow street cells does he he slipped his key into the lock and we all very quietly entered the cell the sleeper half turned and then settled down once more into a deep slumber holmes stooped to the waterjug moistened his sponge and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoners face  let me introduce you he shouted to mr neville st clair of lee in the county of kent  never in my life have i seen such a sight the mans face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree gone was the coarse brown tint gone too was the horrid scar which had seamed it across and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face a twitch brought away the tangled red hair and there sitting up in his bed was a pale sadfaced refinedlooking man blackhaired and smoothskinned rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment then suddenly realising the exposure he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow  great heavens cried the inspector it is indeed the missing man i know him from the photograph  the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny be it so said he and pray what am i charged with  with making away with mr neville st oh come you cant be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it said the inspector with a grin well i have been twentyseven years in the force but this really takes the cake  if i am mr neville st clair then it is obvious that no crime has been committed and that therefore i am illegally detained  no crime but a very great error has been committed said holmes you would have done better to have trusted your wife  it was not the wife it was the children groaned the prisoner god help me i would not have them ashamed of their father my god what an exposure what can i do  sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder  if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up said he of course you can hardly avoid publicity on the other hand if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you i do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers inspector bradstreet would i am sure make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities the case would then never go into court at all  god bless you cried the prisoner passionately i would have endured imprisonment ay even execution rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children  you are the first who have ever heard my story my father was a schoolmaster in chesterfield where i received an excellent education i travelled in my youth took to the stage and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london one day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis and i volunteered to supply them there was the point from which all my adventures started it was only by trying begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to base my articles when an actor i had of course learned all the secrets of making up and had been famous in the greenroom for my skill i took advantage now of my attainments i painted my face and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of fleshcoloured plaster then with a red head of hair and an appropriate dress i took my station in the business part of the city ostensibly as a matchseller but really as a beggar for seven hours i plied my trade and when i returned home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no less than 26s 4d  i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until some time later i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for £ 25 i was at my wits end where to get the money but a sudden idea came to me i begged a fortnights grace from the creditor asked for a holiday from my employers and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise in ten days i had the money and had paid the debt  well you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at £ 2 a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint laying my cap on the ground and sitting still it was a long fight between my pride and the money but the dollars won at last and i threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first chosen inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers only one man knew my secret he was the keeper of a low den in which i used to lodge in swandam lane where i could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a welldressed man about town this fellow a lascar was well paid by me for his rooms so that i knew that my secret was safe in his possession  well very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of money i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn £ 700 a yearwhich is less than my average takingsbut i had exceptional advantages in my power of making up and also in a facility of repartee which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city all day a stream of pennies varied by silver poured in upon me and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take £ 2  as i grew richer i grew more ambitious took a house in the country and eventually married without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation my dear wife knew that i had business in the city she little knew what  last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw to my horror and astonishment that my wife was standing in the street with her eyes fixed full upon me i gave a cry of surprise threw up my arms to cover my face and rushing to my confidant the lascar entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me i heard her voice downstairs but i knew that she could not ascend swiftly i threw off my clothes pulled on those of a beggar and put on my pigments and wig even a wifes eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise but then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room and that the clothes might betray me i threw open the window reopening by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning then i seized my coat which was weighted by the coppers which i had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which i carried my takings i hurled it out of the window and it disappeared into the thames the other clothes would have followed but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair and a few minutes after i found rather i confess to my relief that instead of being identified as mr neville st clair i was arrested as his murderer  i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain i was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible and hence my preference for a dirty face knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious i slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me together with a hurried scrawl telling her that she had no cause to fear  that note only reached her yesterday said holmes  good god what a week she must have spent  the police have watched this lascar said inspector bradstreet and i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his who forgot all about it for some days  that was it said holmes nodding approvingly i have no doubt of it but have you never been prosecuted for begging  many times but what was a fine to me  it must stop here however said bradstreet if the police are to hush this thing up there must be no more of hugh boone  i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take  in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken but if you are found again then all must come out i am sure mr holmes that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up i wish i knew how you reach your results  i reached this one said my friend by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag i think watson that if we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast     vii the adventure of the blue carbuncle   i had called upon my friend sherlock holmes upon the second morning after christmas with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season he was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressinggown a piperack within his reach upon the right and a pile of crumpled morning papers evidently newly studied near at hand beside the couch was a wooden chair and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hardfelt hat much the worse for wear and cracked in several places a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination  you are engaged said i perhaps i interrupt you  not at all i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results the matter is a perfectly trivial onehe jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hatbut there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction  i seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire for a sharp frost had set in and the windows were thick with the ice crystals i suppose i remarked that homely as it looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to itthat it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime  no no no crime said sherlock holmes laughing only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity every possible combination of events may be expected to take place and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal we have already had experience of such  so much so i remarked that of the last six cases which i have added to my notes three have been entirely free of any legal crime  precisely you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler papers to the singular case of miss mary sutherland and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip well i have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category you know peterson the commissionaire  yes  it is to him that this trophy belongs  it is his hat  no no he found it its owner is unknown i beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem and first as to how it came here it arrived upon christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is i have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of petersons fire the facts are these  about four oclock on christmas morning peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down tottenham court road in front of him he saw in the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder as he reached the corner of goodge street a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs one of the latter knocked off the mans hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants but the man shocked at having broken the window and seeing an officiallooking person in uniform rushing towards him dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham court road the roughs had also fled at the appearance of peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose  which surely he restored to their owner  my dear fellow there lies the problem it is true that for mrs henry baker was printed upon a small card which was tied to the birds left leg and it is also true that the initials h b are legible upon the lining of this hat but as there are some thousands of bakers and some hundreds of henry bakers in this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them  what then did peterson do  he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me the goose we retained until this morning when there were signs that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay its finder has carried it off therefore to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christmas dinner  did he not advertise  no  then what clue could you have as to his identity  only as much as we can deduce  from his hat  precisely  but you are joking what can you gather from this old battered felt  here is my lens you know my methods what can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article  i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape hard and much the worse for wear the lining had been of red silk but was a good deal discoloured there was no makers name but as holmes had remarked the initials h b were scrawled upon one side it was pierced in the brim for a hatsecurer but the elastic was missing for the rest it was cracked exceedingly dusty and spotted in several places although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink  i can see nothing said i handing it back to my friend  on the contrary watson you can see everything you fail however to reason from what you see you are too timid in drawing your inferences  then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat  he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him it is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been he remarked and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it and also that he was fairly welltodo within the last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days he had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink at work upon him this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him  my dear holmes  he has however retained some degree of selfrespect he continued disregarding my remonstrance he is a man who leads a sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is middleaged has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days and which he anoints with limecream these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat also by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house  you are certainly joking holmes  not in the least is it possible that even now when i give you these results you are unable to see how they are attained  i have no doubt that i am very stupid but i must confess that i am unable to follow you for example how did you deduce that this man was intellectual  for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head it came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose it is a question of cubic capacity said he a man with so large a brain must have something in it  the decline of his fortunes then  this hat is three years old these flat brims curled at the edge came in then it is a hat of the very best quality look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining if this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago and has had no hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world  well that is clear enough certainly but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression  sherlock holmes laughed here is the foresight said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hatsecurer they are never sold upon hats if this man ordered one it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind but since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature on the other hand he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his selfrespect  your reasoning is certainly plausible  the further points that he is middleaged that his hair is grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses limecream are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining the lens discloses a large number of hairends clean cut by the scissors of the barber they all appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odour of limecream this dust you will observe is not the gritty grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be in the best of training  but his wifeyou said that she had ceased to love him  this hat has not been brushed for weeks when i see you my dear watson with a weeks accumulation of dust upon your hat and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state i shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wifes affection  but he might be a bachelor  nay he was bringing home the goose as a peaceoffering to his wife remember the card upon the birds leg  you have an answer to everything but how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house  one tallow stain or even two might come by chance but when i see no less than five i think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallowwalks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other anyhow he never got tallowstains from a gasjet are you satisfied  well it is very ingenious said i laughing but since as you said just now there has been no crime committed and no harm done save the loss of a goose all this seems to be rather a waste of energy  sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply when the door flew open and peterson the commissionaire rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment  the goose mr holmes the goose sir he gasped  eh what of it then has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the mans excited face  see here sir see what my wife found in its crop he held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone rather smaller than a bean in size but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand  sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle by jove peterson said he this is treasure trove indeed i suppose you know what you have got  a diamond sir a precious stone it cuts into glass as though it were putty  its more than a precious stone it is the precious stone  not the countess of morcars blue carbuncle i ejaculated  precisely so i ought to know its size and shape seeing that i have read the advertisement about it in the times every day lately it is absolutely unique and its value can only be conjectured but the reward offered of £ 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price  a thousand pounds great lord of mercy the commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us  that is the reward and i have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem  it was lost if i remember aright at the hotel cosmopolitan i remarked  precisely so on december 22nd just five days ago john horner a plumber was accused of having abstracted it from the ladys jewelcase the evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes i have some account of the matter here i believe he rummaged amid his newspapers glancing over the dates until at last he smoothed one out doubled it over and read the following paragraph   hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery john horner 26 plumber was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst abstracted from the jewelcase of the countess of morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle james ryder upperattendant at the hotel gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown horner up to the dressingroom of the countess of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate which was loose he had remained with horner some little time but had finally been called away on returning he found that horner had disappeared that the bureau had been forced open and that the small morocco casket in which as it afterwards transpired the countess was accustomed to keep her jewel was lying empty upon the dressingtable ryder instantly gave the alarm and horner was arrested the same evening but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms catherine cusack maid to the countess deposed to having heard ryders cry of dismay on discovering the robbery and to having rushed into the room where she found matters as described by the last witness inspector bradstreet b division gave evidence as to the arrest of horner who struggled frantically and protested his innocence in the strongest terms evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence but referred it to the assizes horner who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court  hum so much for the policecourt said holmes thoughtfully tossing aside the paper the question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewelcase at one end to the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other you see watson our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect here is the stone the stone came from the goose and the goose came from mr henry baker the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which i have bored you so now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery to do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers if this fail i shall have recourse to other methods  what will you say  give me a pencil and that slip of paper now then  found at the corner of goodge street a goose and a black felt hat mr henry baker can have the same by applying at 6 30 this evening at 221b baker street that is clear and concise  very but will he see it  well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor man the loss was a heavy one he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of nothing but flight but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird then again the introduction of his name will cause him to see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it here you are peterson run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers  in which sir  oh in the globe star pall mall st jamess gazette evening news standard echo and any others that occur to you  very well sir and this stone  ah yes i shall keep the stone thank you and i say peterson just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring  when the commissionaire had gone holmes took up the stone and held it against the light its a bonny thing said he just see how it glints and sparkles of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime every good stone is they are the devils pet baits in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed this stone is not yet twenty years old it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red in spite of its youth it has already a sinister history there have been two murders a vitriolthrowing a suicide and several robberies brought about for the sake of this fortygrain weight of crystallised charcoal who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison ill lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it  do you think that this man horner is innocent  i cannot tell  well then do you imagine that this other one henry baker had anything to do with the matter  it is i think much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold that however i shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement  and you can do nothing until then  nothing  in that case i shall continue my professional round but i shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned for i should like to see the solution of so tangled a business  very glad to see you i dine at seven there is a woodcock i believe by the way in view of recent occurrences perhaps i ought to ask mrs hudson to examine its crop  i had been delayed at a case and it was a little after halfpast six when i found myself in baker street once more as i approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight just as i arrived the door was opened and we were shown up together to holmes room  mr henry baker i believe said he rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume pray take this chair by the fire mr baker it is a cold night and i observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter ah watson you have just come at the right time is that your hat mr baker  yes sir that is undoubtedly my hat  he was a large man with rounded shoulders a massive head and a broad intelligent face sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown a touch of red in nose and cheeks with a slight tremor of his extended hand recalled holmes surmise as to his habits his rusty black frockcoat was buttoned right up in front with the collar turned up and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt he spoke in a slow staccato fashion choosing his words with care and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had illusage at the hands of fortune  we have retained these things for some days said holmes because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise  our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were he remarked i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them  very naturally by the way about the bird we were compelled to eat it  to eat it our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement  yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your purpose equally well  oh certainly certainly answered mr baker with a sigh of relief  of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of your own bird so if you wish  the man burst into a hearty laugh they might be useful to me as relics of my adventure said he but beyond that i can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me no sir i think that with your permission i will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon the sideboard  sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders  there is your hat then and there your bird said he by the way would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from i am somewhat of a fowl fancier and i have seldom seen a better grown goose  certainly sir said baker who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm there are a few of us who frequent the alpha inn near the museumwe are to be found in the museum itself during the day you understand this year our good host windigate by name instituted a goose club by which on consideration of some few pence every week we were each to receive a bird at christmas my pence were duly paid and the rest is familiar to you i am much indebted to you sir for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way  so much for mr henry baker said holmes when he had closed the door behind him it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter are you hungry watson  not particularly  then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot  by all means  it was a bitter night so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats outside the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky and the breath of the passersby blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors quarter wimpole street harley street and so through wigmore street into oxford street in a quarter of an hour we were in bloomsbury at the alpha inn which is a small publichouse at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into holborn holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddyfaced whiteaproned landlord  your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese said he  my geese the man seemed surprised  yes i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr henry baker who was a member of your goose club  ah yes i see but you see sir thems not our geese  indeed whose then  well i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden  indeed i know some of them which was it  breckinridge is his name  ah i dont know him well heres your good health landlord and prosperity to your house goodnight  now for mr breckinridge he continued buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air remember watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence it is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt but in any case we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police and which a singular chance has placed in our hands let us follow it out to the bitter end faces to the south then and quick march  we passed across holborn down endell street and so through a zigzag of slums to covent garden market one of the largest stalls bore the name of breckinridge upon it and the proprietor a horseylooking man with a sharp face and trim sidewhiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters  goodevening its a cold night said holmes  the salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion  sold out of geese i see continued holmes pointing at the bare slabs of marble  let you have five hundred tomorrow morning  thats no good  well there are some on the stall with the gasflare  ah but i was recommended to you  who by  the landlord of the alpha  oh yes i sent him a couple of dozen  fine birds they were too now where did you get them from  to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman  now then mister said he with his head cocked and his arms akimbo what are you driving at lets have it straight now  it is straight enough i should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the alpha  well then i shant tell you so now  oh it is a matter of no importance but i dont know why you should be so warm over such a trifle  warm youd be as warm maybe if you were as pestered as i am when i pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business but its where are the geese and who did you sell the geese to and what will you take for the geese one would think they were the only geese in the world to hear the fuss that is made over them  well i have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries said holmes carelessly if you wont tell us the bet is off that is all but im always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls and i have a fiver on it that the bird i ate is country bred  well then youve lost your fiver for its town bred snapped the salesman  its nothing of the kind  i say it is  i dont believe it  dyou think you know more about fowls than i who have handled them ever since i was a nipper i tell you all those birds that went to the alpha were town bred  youll never persuade me to believe that  will you bet then  its merely taking your money for i know that i am right but ill have a sovereign on with you just to teach you not to be obstinate  the salesman chuckled grimly bring me the books bill said he  the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasybacked one laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp  now then mr cocksure said the salesman i thought that i was out of geese but before i finish youll find that there is still one left in my shop you see this little book  well  thats the list of the folk from whom i buy dyou see well then here on this page are the country folk and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger now then you see this other page in red ink well that is a list of my town suppliers now look at that third name just read it out to me  mrs oakshott 117 brixton road249 read holmes  quite so now turn that up in the ledger  holmes turned to the page indicated here you are mrs oakshott 117 brixton road egg and poultry supplier  now then whats the last entry  december 22nd twentyfour geese at 7s 6d  quite so there you are and underneath  sold to mr windigate of the alpha at 12s  what have you to say now  sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined he drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words a few yards off he stopped under a lamppost and laughed in the hearty noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him  when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the pink un protruding out of his pocket you can always draw him by a bet said he i daresay that if i had put £ 100 down in front of him that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager well watson we are i fancy nearing the end of our quest and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this mrs oakshott tonight or whether we should reserve it for tomorrow it is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter and i should  his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left turning round we saw a little ratfaced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp while breckinridge the salesman framed in the door of his stall was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure  ive had enough of you and your geese he shouted i wish you were all at the devil together if you come pestering me any more with your silly talk ill set the dog at you you bring mrs oakshott here and ill answer her but what have you to do with it did i buy the geese off you  no but one of them was mine all the same whined the little man  well then ask mrs oakshott for it  she told me to ask you  well you can ask the king of proosia for all i care ive had enough of it get out of this he rushed fiercely forward and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness  ha this may save us a visit to brixton road whispered holmes come with me and we will see what is to be made of this fellow striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder he sprang round and i could see in the gaslight that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face  who are you then what do you want he asked in a quavering voice  you will excuse me said holmes blandly but i could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now i think that i could be of assistance to you  you who are you how could you know anything of the matter  my name is sherlock holmes it is my business to know what other people dont know  but you can know nothing of this  excuse me i know everything of it you are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by mrs oakshott of brixton road to a salesman named breckinridge by him in turn to mr windigate of the alpha and by him to his club of which mr henry baker is a member  oh sir you are the very man whom i have longed to meet cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter  sherlock holmes hailed a fourwheeler which was passing in that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this windswept marketplace said he but pray tell me before we go farther who it is that i have the pleasure of assisting  the man hesitated for an instant my name is john robinson he answered with a sidelong glance  no no the real name said holmes sweetly it is always awkward doing business with an alias  a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger well then said he my real name is james ryder  precisely so head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan pray step into the cab and i shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know  the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with halffrightened halfhopeful eyes as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe then he stepped into the cab and in half an hour we were back in the sittingroom at baker street nothing had been said during our drive but the high thin breathing of our new companion and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands spoke of the nervous tension within him  here we are said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room the fire looks very seasonable in this weather you look cold mr ryder pray take the basketchair i will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours now then you want to know what became of those geese  yes sir  or rather i fancy of that goose it was one bird i imagine in which you were interestedwhite with a black bar across the tail  ryder quivered with emotion oh sir he cried can you tell me where it went to  it came here  here  yes and a most remarkable bird it proved i dont wonder that you should take an interest in it it laid an egg after it was deadthe bonniest brightest little blue egg that ever was seen i have it here in my museum  our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand holmes unlocked his strongbox and held up the blue carbuncle which shone out like a star with a cold brilliant manypointed radiance ryder stood glaring with a drawn face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it  the games up ryder said holmes quietly hold up man or youll be into the fire give him an arm back into his chair watson hes not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity give him a dash of brandy so now he looks a little more human what a shrimp it is to be sure  for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser  i have almost every link in my hands and all the proofs which i could possibly need so there is little which you need tell me still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete you had heard ryder of this blue stone of the countess of morcars  it was catherine cusack who told me of it said he in a crackling voice  i seeher ladyships waitingmaid well the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you as it has been for better men before you but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used it seems to me ryder that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you you knew that this man horner the plumber had been concerned in some such matter before and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him what did you do then you made some small job in my ladys roomyou and your confederate cusackand you managed that he should be the man sent for then when he had left you rifled the jewelcase raised the alarm and had this unfortunate man arrested you then  ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companions knees for gods sake have mercy he shrieked think of my father of my mother it would break their hearts i never went wrong before i never will again i swear it ill swear it on a bible oh dont bring it into court for christs sake dont  get back into your chair said holmes sternly it is very well to cringe and crawl now but you thought little enough of this poor horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing  i will fly mr holmes i will leave the country sir then the charge against him will break down  hum we will talk about that and now let us hear a true account of the next act how came the stone into the goose and how came the goose into the open market tell us the truth for there lies your only hope of safety  ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips i will tell you it just as it happened sir said he when horner had been arrested it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once for i did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe i went out as if on some commission and i made for my sisters house she had married a man named oakshott and lived in brixton road where she fattened fowls for the market all the way there every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective and for all that it was a cold night the sweat was pouring down my face before i came to the brixton road my sister asked me what was the matter and why i was so pale but i told her that i had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel then i went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do  i had a friend once called maudsley who went to the bad and has just been serving his time in pentonville one day he had met me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they could get rid of what they stole i knew that he would be true to me for i knew one or two things about him so i made up my mind to go right on to kilburn where he lived and take him into my confidence he would show me how to turn the stone into money but how to get to him in safety i thought of the agonies i had gone through in coming from the hotel i might at any moment be seized and searched and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket i was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how i could beat the best detective that ever lived  my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present and i knew that she was always as good as her word i would take my goose now and in it i would carry my stone to kilburn there was a little shed in the yard and behind this i drove one of the birdsa fine big one white with a barred tail i caught it and prying its bill open i thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach the bird gave a gulp and i felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop but the creature flapped and struggled and out came my sister to know what was the matter as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others  whatever were you doing with that bird jem says she  well said i you said youd give me one for christmas and i was feeling which was the fattest  oh says she weve set yours aside for youjems bird we call it its the big white one over yonder theres twentysix of them which makes one for you and one for us and two dozen for the market  thank you maggie says i but if it is all the same to you id rather have that one i was handling just now  the other is a good three pound heavier said she and we fattened it expressly for you  never mind ill have the other and ill take it now said i  oh just as you like said she a little huffed which is it you want then  that white one with the barred tail right in the middle of the flock  oh very well kill it and take it with you  well i did what she said mr holmes and i carried the bird all the way to kilburn i told my pal what i had done for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to he laughed until he choked and we got a knife and opened the goose my heart turned to water for there was no sign of the stone and i knew that some terrible mistake had occurred i left the bird rushed back to my sisters and hurried into the back yard there was not a bird to be seen there  where are they all maggie i cried  gone to the dealers jem  which dealers  breckinridge of covent garden  but was there another with a barred tail i asked the same as the one i chose  yes jem there were two barredtailed ones and i could never tell them apart  well then of course i saw it all and i ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man breckinridge but he had sold the lot at once and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone you heard him yourselves tonight well he has always answered me like that my sister thinks that i am going mad sometimes i think that i am myself and nowand now i am myself a branded thief without ever having touched the wealth for which i sold my character god help me god help me he burst into convulsive sobbing with his face buried in his hands  there was a long silence broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes fingertips upon the edge of the table then my friend rose and threw open the door  get out said he  what sir oh heaven bless you  no more words get out  and no more words were needed there was a rush a clatter upon the stairs the bang of a door and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street  after all watson said holmes reaching up his hand for his clay pipe i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies if horner were in danger it would be another thing but this fellow will not appear against him and the case must collapse i suppose that i am commuting a felony but it is just possible that i am saving a soul this fellow will not go wrong again he is too terribly frightened send him to gaol now and you make him a gaolbird for life besides it is the season of forgiveness chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem and its solution is its own reward if you will have the goodness to touch the bell doctor we will begin another investigation in which also a bird will be the chief feature     viii the adventure of the speckled band   on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend sherlock holmes i find many tragic some comic a large number merely strange but none commonplace for working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic of all these varied cases however i cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the wellknown surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran the events in question occurred in the early days of my association with holmes when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in baker street it is possible that i might have placed them upon record before but a promise of secrecy was made at the time from which i have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given it is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light for i have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of dr grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth  it was early in april in the year 83 that i woke one morning to find sherlock holmes standing fully dressed by the side of my bed he was a late riser as a rule and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarterpast seven i blinked up at him in some surprise and perhaps just a little resentment for i was myself regular in my habits  very sorry to knock you up watson said he but its the common lot this morning mrs hudson has been knocked up she retorted upon me and i on you  what is it thena fire  no a client it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me she is waiting now in the sittingroom now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate should it prove to be an interesting case you would i am sure wish to follow it from the outset i thought at any rate that i should call you and give you the chance  my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything  i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his professional investigations and in admiring the rapid deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him i rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sittingroom a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled who had been sitting in the window rose as we entered  goodmorning madam said holmes cheerily my name is sherlock holmes this is my intimate friend and associate dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself ha i am glad to see that mrs hudson has had the good sense to light the fire pray draw up to it and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee for i observe that you are shivering  it is not cold which makes me shiver said the woman in a low voice changing her seat as requested  what then  it is fear mr holmes it is terror she raised her veil as she spoke and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation her face all drawn and grey with restless frightened eyes like those of some hunted animal her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty but her hair was shot with premature grey and her expression was weary and haggard sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick allcomprehensive glances  you must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and patting her forearm we shall soon set matters right i have no doubt you have come in by train this morning i see  you know me then  no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove you must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dogcart along heavy roads before you reached the station  the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion  there is no mystery my dear madam said he smiling the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places the marks are perfectly fresh there is no vehicle save a dogcart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you sit on the lefthand side of the driver  whatever your reasons may be you are perfectly correct said she i started from home before six reached leatherhead at twenty past and came in by the first train to waterloo sir i can stand this strain no longer i shall go mad if it continues i have no one to turn tonone save only one who cares for me and he poor fellow can be of little aid i have heard of you mr holmes i have heard of you from mrs farintosh whom you helped in the hour of her sore need it was from her that i had your address oh sir do you not think that you could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services but in a month or six weeks i shall be married with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful  holmes turned to his desk and unlocking it drew out a small casebook which he consulted  farintosh said he ah yes i recall the case it was concerned with an opal tiara i think it was before your time watson i can only say madam that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend as to reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which suits you best and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter  alas replied our visitor the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman he does not say so but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes but i have heard mr holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me  i am all attention madam  my name is helen stoner and i am living with my stepfather who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey  holmes nodded his head the name is familiar to me said he  the family was at one time among the richest in england and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north and hampshire in the west in the last century however four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency nothing was left save a few acres of ground and the twohundredyearold house which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage the last squire dragged out his existence there living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper but his only son my stepfather seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions obtained an advance from a relative which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to calcutta where by his professional skill and his force of character he established a large practice in a fit of anger however caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence as it was he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man  when dr roylott was in india he married my mother mrs stoner the young widow of majorgeneral stoner of the bengal artillery my sister julia and i were twins and we were only two years old at the time of my mothers remarriage she had a considerable sum of moneynot less than £ 1000 a yearand this she bequeathed to dr roylott entirely while we resided with him with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage shortly after our return to england my mother diedshe was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe dr roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran the money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness  but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family and in my stepfathers case it had i believe been intensified by his long residence in the tropics a series of disgraceful brawls took place two of which ended in the policecourt until at last he became the terror of the village and the folks would fly at his approach for he is a man of immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger  last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather together that i was able to avert another public exposure he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramblecovered land which represent the family estate and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end he has a passion also for indian animals which are sent over to him by a correspondent and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master  you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives no servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house she was but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already begun to whiten even as mine has  your sister is dead then  she died just two years ago and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you you can understand that living the life which i have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position we had however an aunt my mothers maiden sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this ladys house julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there a halfpay major of marines to whom she became engaged my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion  sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor  pray be precise as to details said he  it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory the manorhouse is as i have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sittingrooms being in the central block of the buildings of these bedrooms the first is dr roylotts the second my sisters and the third my own there is no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor do i make myself plain  perfectly so  the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn that fatal night dr roylott had gone to his room early though we knew that he had not retired to rest for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke she left her room therefore and came into mine where she sat for some time chatting about her approaching wedding at eleven oclock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door and looked back  tell me helen said she have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night  never said i  i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep  certainly not but why  because during the last few nights i have always about three in the morning heard a low clear whistle i am a light sleeper and it has awakened me i cannot tell where it came fromperhaps from the next room perhaps from the lawn i thought that i would just ask you whether you had heard it  no i have not it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation  very likely and yet if it were on the lawn i wonder that you did not hear it also  ah but i sleep more heavily than you  well it is of no great consequence at any rate she smiled back at me closed my door and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock  indeed said holmes was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night  always  and why  i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked  quite so pray proceed with your statement  i could not sleep that night a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me my sister and i you will recollect were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied it was a wild night the wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman i knew that it was my sisters voice i sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen as i ran down the passage my sisters door was unlocked and revolved slowly upon its hinges i stared at it horrorstricken not knowing what was about to issue from it by the light of the corridorlamp i saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed at first i thought that she had not recognised me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget oh my god helen it was the band the speckled band there was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctors room but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words i rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressinggown when he reached my sisters side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister  one moment said holmes are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound could you swear to it  that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry it is my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have been deceived  was your sister dressed  no she was in her nightdress in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match and in her left a matchbox  showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place that is important and what conclusions did the coroner come to  he investigated the case with great care for dr roylotts conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were blocked by oldfashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night the walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result the chimney is wide but is barred up by four large staples it is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end besides there were no marks of any violence upon her  how about poison  the doctors examined her for it but without success  what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then  it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine  were there gipsies in the plantation at the time  yes there are nearly always some there  ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a banda speckled band  sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used  holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied  these are very deep waters said he pray go on with your narrative  two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever a month ago however a dear friend whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage his name is armitagepercy armitagethe second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom wall has been pierced so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as i lay awake thinking over her terrible fate i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death i sprang up and lit the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room i was too shaken to go to bed again however so i dressed and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down got a dogcart at the crown inn which is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice  you have done wisely said my friend but have you told me all  yes all  miss roylott you have not you are screening your stepfather  why what do you mean  for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitors knee five little livid spots the marks of four fingers and a thumb were printed upon the white wrist  you have been cruelly used said holmes  the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist he is a hard man she said and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength  there was a long silence during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire  this is a very deep business he said at last there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action yet we have not a moment to lose if we were to come to stoke moran today would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather  as it happens he spoke of coming into town today upon some most important business it is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you we have a housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and i could easily get her out of the way  excellent you are not averse to this trip watson  by no means  then we shall both come what are you going to do yourself  i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town but i shall return by the twelve oclock train so as to be there in time for your coming  and you may expect us early in the afternoon i have myself some small business matters to attend to will you not wait and breakfast  no i must go my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room  and what do you think of it all watson asked sherlock holmes leaning back in his chair  it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business  dark enough and sinister enough  yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end  what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman  i cannot think  when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughters marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines  but what then did the gipsies do  i cannot imagine  i see many objections to any such theory  and so do i it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day i want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be explained away but what in the name of the devil  the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture his costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural having a black tophat a long frockcoat and a pair of high gaiters with a huntingcrop swinging in his hand so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side a large face seared with a thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and marked with every evil passion was turned from one to the other of us while his deepset bileshot eyes and his high thin fleshless nose gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey  which of you is holmes asked this apparition  my name sir but you have the advantage of me said my companion quietly  i am dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran  indeed doctor said holmes blandly pray take a seat  i will do nothing of the kind my stepdaughter has been here i have traced her what has she been saying to you  it is a little cold for the time of the year said holmes  what has she been saying to you screamed the old man furiously  but i have heard that the crocuses promise well continued my companion imperturbably  ha you put me off do you said our new visitor taking a step forward and shaking his huntingcrop i know you you scoundrel i have heard of you before you are holmes the meddler  my friend smiled  holmes the busybody  his smile broadened  holmes the scotland yard jackinoffice  holmes chuckled heartily your conversation is most entertaining said he when you go out close the door for there is a decided draught  i will go when i have had my say dont you dare to meddle with my affairs i know that miss stoner has been here i traced her i am a dangerous man to fall foul of see here he stepped swiftly forward seized the poker and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands  see that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarled and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room  he seems a very amiable person said holmes laughing i am not quite so bulky but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own as he spoke he picked up the steel poker and with a sudden effort straightened it out again  fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force this incident gives zest to our investigation however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her and now watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors commons where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter  it was nearly one oclock when sherlock holmes returned from his excursion he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper scrawled over with notes and figures  i have seen the will of the deceased wife said he to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned the total income which at the time of the wifes death was little short of £ 1100 is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than £ 750 each daughter can claim an income of £ 250 in case of marriage it is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent my mornings work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort and now watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket an eleys no 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots that and a toothbrush are i think all that we need  at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes it was a perfect day with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged my companion sat in the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the deepest thought suddenly however he started tapped me on the shoulder and pointed over the meadows  look there said he  a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope thickening into a grove at the highest point from amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high rooftree of a very old mansion  stoke moran said he  yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott remarked the driver  there is some building going on there said holmes that is where we are going  theres the village said the driver pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left but if you want to get to the house youll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the footpath over the fields there it is where the lady is walking  and the lady i fancy is miss stoner observed holmes shading his eyes yes i think we had better do as you suggest  we got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead  i thought it as well said holmes as we climbed the stile that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite business it may stop his gossip goodafternoon miss stoner you see that we have been as good as our word  our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy i have been waiting so eagerly for you she cried shaking hands with us warmly all has turned out splendidly dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening  we have had the pleasure of making the doctors acquaintance said holmes and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened  good heavens she cried he has followed me then  so it appears  he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him what will he say when he returns  he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track you must lock yourself up from him tonight if he is violent we shall take you away to your aunts at harrow now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine  the building was of grey lichenblotched stone with a high central portion and two curving wings like the claws of a crab thrown out on each side in one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards while the roof was partly caved in a picture of ruin the central portion was in little better repair but the righthand block was comparatively modern and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the stonework had been broken into but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit holmes walked slowly up and down the illtrimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows  this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sisters and the one next to the main building to dr roylotts chamber  exactly so but i am now sleeping in the middle one  pending the alterations as i understand by the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall  there were none i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room  ah that is suggestive now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open there are windows in it of course  yes but very small ones too narrow for anyone to pass through  as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters  miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar then with his lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built firmly into the massive masonry hum said he scratching his chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some difficulties no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter  a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened holmes refused to examine the third chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which miss stoner was now sleeping and in which her sister had met with her fate it was a homely little room with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace after the fashion of old countryhouses a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner a narrow whitecounterpaned bed in another and a dressingtable on the lefthand side of the window these articles with two small wickerwork chairs made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown wormeaten oak so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down taking in every detail of the apartment  where does that bell communicate with he asked at last pointing to a thick bellrope which hung down beside the bed the tassel actually lying upon the pillow  it goes to the housekeepers room  it looks newer than the other things  yes it was only put there a couple of years ago  your sister asked for it i suppose  no i never heard of her using it we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves  indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bellpull there you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining minutely the cracks between the boards then he did the same with the woodwork with which the chamber was panelled finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall finally he took the bellrope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug  why its a dummy said he  wont it ring  no it is not even attached to a wire this is very interesting you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is  how very absurd i never noticed that before  very strange muttered holmes pulling at the rope there are one or two very singular points about this room for example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air  that is also quite modern said the lady  done about the same time as the bellrope remarked holmes  yes there were several little changes carried out about that time  they seem to have been of a most interesting characterdummy bellropes and ventilators which do not ventilate with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment  dr grimesby roylotts chamber was larger than that of his stepdaughter but was as plainly furnished a campbed a small wooden shelf full of books mostly of a technical character an armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a round table and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest  whats in here he asked tapping the safe  my stepfathers business papers  oh you have seen inside then  only once some years ago i remember that it was full of papers  there isnt a cat in it for example  no what a strange idea  well look at this he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it  no we dont keep a cat but there is a cheetah and a baboon  ah yes of course well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i daresay there is one point which i should wish to determine he squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention  thank you that is quite settled said he rising and putting his lens in his pocket hullo here is something interesting  the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed the lash however was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord  what do you make of that watson  its a common enough lash but i dont know why it should be tied  that is not quite so common is it ah me its a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn  i had never seen my friends face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation we had walked several times up and down the lawn neither miss stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie  it is very essential miss stoner said he that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect  i shall most certainly do so  the matter is too serious for any hesitation your life may depend upon your compliance  i assure you that i am in your hands  in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room  both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment  yes it must be so let me explain i believe that that is the village inn over there  yes that is the crown  very good your windows would be visible from there  certainly  you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy i have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night  oh yes easily  the rest you will leave in our hands  but what will you do  we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you  i believe mr holmes that you have already made up your mind said miss stoner laying her hand upon my companions sleeve  perhaps i have  then for pitys sake tell me what was the cause of my sisters death  i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak  you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright  no i do not think so i think that there was probably some more tangible cause and now miss stoner we must leave you for if dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain goodbye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you  sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sittingroom at the crown inn they were on the upper floor and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate and of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house at dusk we saw dr grimesby roylott drive past his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him the boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctors voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him the trap drove on and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sittingrooms  do you know watson said holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness i have really some scruples as to taking you tonight there is a distinct element of danger  can i be of assistance  your presence might be invaluable  then i shall certainly come  it is very kind of you  you speak of danger you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me  no but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more i imagine that you saw all that i did  i saw nothing remarkable save the bellrope and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine  you saw the ventilator too  yes but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through  i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran  my dear holmes  oh yes i did you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr roylotts cigar now of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms it could only be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroners inquiry i deduced a ventilator  but what harm can there be in that  well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates a ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies does not that strike you  i cannot as yet see any connection  did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed  no  it was clamped to the floor did you ever see a bed fastened like that before  i cannot say that i have  the lady could not move her bed it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the ropeor so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bellpull  holmes i cried i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime  subtle enough and horrible enough when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals he has nerve and he has knowledge palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession this man strikes even deeper but i think watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over for goodness sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful  about nine oclock the light among the trees was extinguished and all was dark in the direction of the manor house two hours passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us  that is our signal said holmes springing to his feet it comes from the middle window  as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance and that it was possible that we might spend the night there a moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blowing in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand  there was little difficulty in entering the grounds for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall making our way among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness  my god i whispered did you see it  holmes was for the moment as startled as i his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear  it is a nice household he murmured that is the baboon  i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected there was a cheetah too perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment i confess that i felt easier in my mind when after following holmes example and slipping off my shoes i found myself inside the bedroom my companion noiselessly closed the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes round the room all was as we had seen it in the daytime then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to distinguish the words   the least sound would be fatal to our plans  i nodded to show that i had heard  we must sit without light he would see it through the ventilator  i nodded again  do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it have your pistol ready in case we should need it i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair  i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table  holmes had brought up a long thin cane and this he placed upon the bed beside him by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle then he turned down the lamp and we were left in darkness  how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil i could not hear a sound not even the drawing of a breath and yet i knew that my companion sat openeyed within a few feet of me in the same state of nervous tension in which i was myself the shutters cut off the least ray of light and we waited in absolute darkness  from outside came the occasional cry of a nightbird and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of an hour how long they seemed those quarters twelve struck and one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall  suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal someone in the next room had lit a darklantern i heard a gentle sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger for half an hour i sat with straining ears then suddenly another sound became audiblea very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle the instant that we heard it holmes sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bellpull  you see it watson he yelled you see it  but i saw nothing at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely i could however see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened it swelled up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek they say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the sleepers from their beds it struck cold to our hearts and i stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose  what can it mean i gasped  it means that it is all over holmes answered and perhaps after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will enter dr roylotts room  with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within then he turned the handle and entered i at his heels with the cocked pistol in my hand  it was a singular sight which met our eyes on the table stood a darklantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressinggown his bare ankles protruding beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his head as we entered he made neither sound nor motion  the band the speckled band whispered holmes  i took a step forward in an instant his strange headgear began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamondshaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent  it is a swamp adder cried holmes the deadliest snake in india he has died within ten seconds of being bitten violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened  as he spoke he drew the dogwhip swiftly from the dead mans lap and throwing the noose round the reptiles neck he drew it from its horrid perch and carrying it at arms length threw it into the iron safe which he closed upon it  such are the true facts of the death of dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day  i had said he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data the presence of the gipsies and the use of the word band which was used by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door my attention was speedily drawn as i have already remarked to you to this ventilator and to the bellrope which hung down to the bed the discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india i felt that i was probably on the right track the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantage it would be a sharpeyed coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work then i thought of the whistle of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim he had trained it probably by the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed it might or might not bite the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim  i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the light and attacked it  with the result of driving it through the ventilator  and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr grimesby roylotts death and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience     ix the adventure of the engineers thumb   of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend mr sherlock holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy there were only two which i was the means of introducing to his noticethat of mr hatherleys thumb and that of colonel warburtons madness of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results the story has i believe been told more than once in the newspapers but like all such narratives its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single halfcolumn of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth at the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect  it was in the summer of 89 not long after my marriage that the events occurred which i am now about to summarise i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street rooms although i continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us my practice had steadily increased and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station i got a few patients from among the officials one of these whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence  one morning at a little before seven oclock i was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consultingroom i dressed hurriedly for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs as i descended my old ally the guard came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him  ive got him here he whispered jerking his thumb over his shoulder hes all right  what is it then i asked for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room  its a new patient he whispered i thought id bring him round myself then he couldnt slip away there he is all safe and sound i must go now doctor i have my dooties just the same as you and off he went this trusty tout without even giving me time to thank him  i entered my consultingroom and found a gentleman seated by the table he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped which was mottled all over with bloodstains he was young not more than fiveandtwenty i should say with a strong masculine face but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation which it took all his strength of mind to control  i am sorry to knock you up so early doctor said he but i have had a very serious accident during the night i came in by train this morning and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here i gave the maid a card but i see that she has left it upon the sidetable  i took it up and glanced at it mr victor hatherley hydraulic engineer 16a victoria street 3rd floor that was the name style and abode of my morning visitor i regret that i have kept you waiting said i sitting down in my librarychair you are fresh from a night journey i understand which is in itself a monotonous occupation  oh my night could not be called monotonous said he and laughed he laughed very heartily with a high ringing note leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides all my medical instincts rose up against that laugh  stop it i cried pull yourself together and i poured out some water from a caraffe  it was useless however he was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone presently he came to himself once more very weary and palelooking  i have been making a fool of myself he gasped  not at all drink this i dashed some brandy into the water and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks  thats better said he and now doctor perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb used to be  he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand it gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it there were four protruding fingers and a horrid red spongy surface where the thumb should have been it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots  good heavens i cried this is a terrible injury it must have bled considerably  yes it did i fainted when it was done and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time when i came to i found that it was still bleeding so i tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig  excellent you should have been a surgeon  it is a question of hydraulics you see and came within my own province  this has been done said i examining the wound by a very heavy and sharp instrument  a thing like a cleaver said he  an accident i presume  by no means  what a murderous attack  very murderous indeed  you horrify me  i sponged the wound cleaned it dressed it and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages he lay back without wincing though he bit his lip from time to time  how is that i asked when i had finished  capital between your brandy and your bandage i feel a new man i was very weak but i have had a good deal to go through  perhaps you had better not speak of the matter it is evidently trying to your nerves  oh no not now i shall have to tell my tale to the police but between ourselves if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine i should be surprised if they believed my statement for it is a very extraordinary one and i have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up and even if they believe me the clues which i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done  ha cried i if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved i should strongly recommend you to come to my friend mr sherlock holmes before you go to the official police  oh i have heard of that fellow answered my visitor and i should be very glad if he would take the matter up though of course i must use the official police as well would you give me an introduction to him  ill do better ill take you round to him myself  i should be immensely obliged to you  well call a cab and go together we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him do you feel equal to it  yes i shall not feel easy until i have told my story  then my servant will call a cab and i shall be with you in an instant i rushed upstairs explained the matter shortly to my wife and in five minutes was inside a hansom driving with my new acquaintance to baker street  sherlock holmes was as i expected lounging about his sittingroom in his dressinggown reading the agony column of the times and smoking his beforebreakfast pipe which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece he received us in his quietly genial fashion ordered fresh rashers and eggs and joined us in a hearty meal when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa placed a pillow beneath his head and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach  it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one mr hatherley said he pray lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home tell us what you can but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant  thank you said my patient but i have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me and i think that your breakfast has completed the cure i shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible so i shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences  holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary heavylidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature while i sat opposite to him and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us  you must know said he that i am an orphan and a bachelor residing alone in lodgings in london by profession i am a hydraulic engineer and i have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that i was apprenticed to venner & matheson the wellknown firm of greenwich two years ago having served my time and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor fathers death i determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in victoria street  i suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience to me it has been exceptionally so during two years i have had three consultations and one small job and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me my gross takings amount to £ 27 10s every day from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon i waited in my little den until at last my heart began to sink and i came to believe that i should never have any practice at all  yesterday however just as i was thinking of leaving the office my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business he brought up a card too with the name of colonel lysander stark engraved upon it close at his heels came the colonel himself a man rather over the middle size but of an exceeding thinness i do not think that i have ever seen so thin a man his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit and due to no disease for his eye was bright his step brisk and his bearing assured he was plainly but neatly dressed and his age i should judge would be nearer forty than thirty  mr hatherley said he with something of a german accent you have been recommended to me mr hatherley as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret  i bowed feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address may i ask who it was who gave me so good a character  well perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just at this moment i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in london  that is quite correct i answered but you will excuse me if i say that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications i understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me  undoubtedly so but you will find that all i say is really to the point i have a professional commission for you but absolute secrecy is quite essentialabsolute secrecy you understand and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family  if i promise to keep a secret said i you may absolutely depend upon my doing so  he looked very hard at me as i spoke and it seemed to me that i had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye  do you promise then said he at last  yes i promise  absolute and complete silence before during and after no reference to the matter at all either in word or writing  i have already given you my word  very good he suddenly sprang up and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door the passage outside was empty  thats all right said he coming back i know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their masters affairs now we can talk in safety he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look  a feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience  i beg that you will state your business sir said i my time is of value heaven forgive me for that last sentence but the words came to my lips  how would fifty guineas for a nights work suit you he asked  most admirably  i say a nights work but an hours would be nearer the mark i simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear if you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves what do you think of such a commission as that  the work appears to be light and the pay munificent  precisely so we shall want you to come tonight by the last train  where to  to eyford in berkshire it is a little place near the borders of oxfordshire and within seven miles of reading there is a train from paddington which would bring you there at about 11 15  very good  i shall come down in a carriage to meet you  there is a drive then  yes our little place is quite out in the country it is a good seven miles from eyford station  then we can hardly get there before midnight i suppose there would be no chance of a train back i should be compelled to stop the night  yes we could easily give you a shakedown  that is very awkward could i not come at some more convenient hour  we have judged it best that you should come late it is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you a young and unknown man a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession still of course if you would like to draw out of the business there is plenty of time to do so  i thought of the fifty guineas and of how very useful they would be to me not at all said i i shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes i should like however to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do  quite so it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity i have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you i suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers  entirely  then the matter stands thus you are probably aware that fullersearth is a valuable product and that it is only found in one or two places in england  i have heard so  some little time ago i bought a small placea very small placewithin ten miles of reading i was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fullersearth in one of my fields on examining it however i found that this deposit was a comparatively small one and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and leftboth of them however in the grounds of my neighbours these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a goldmine naturally it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this i took a few of my friends into the secret however and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields this we have now been doing for some time and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press this press as i have already explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the subject we guard our secret very jealously however and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house it would soon rouse inquiry and then if the facts came out it would be goodbye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans that is why i have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to eyford tonight i hope that i make it all plain  i quite follow you said i the only point which i could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fullersearth which as i understand is dug out like gravel from a pit  ah said he carelessly we have our own process we compress the earth into bricks so as to remove them without revealing what they are but that is a mere detail i have taken you fully into my confidence now mr hatherley and i have shown you how i trust you he rose as he spoke i shall expect you then at eyford at 11 15  i shall certainly be there  and not a word to a soul he looked at me with a last long questioning gaze and then pressing my hand in a cold dank grasp he hurried from the room  well when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was very much astonished as you may both think at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me on the one hand of course i was glad for the fee was at least tenfold what i should have asked had i set a price upon my own services and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones on the other hand the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me and i could not think that his explanation of the fullersearth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight and his extreme anxiety lest i should tell anyone of my errand however i threw all fears to the winds ate a hearty supper drove to paddington and started off having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue  at reading i had to change not only my carriage but my station however i was in time for the last train to eyford and i reached the little dimlit station after eleven oclock i was the only passenger who got out there and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern as i passed out through the wicket gate however i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage the door of which was standing open he drew up the windows on either side tapped on the woodwork and away we went as fast as the horse could go  one horse interjected holmes  yes only one  did you observe the colour  yes i saw it by the sidelights when i was stepping into the carriage it was a chestnut  tiredlooking or fresh  oh fresh and glossy  thank you i am sorry to have interrupted you pray continue your most interesting statement  away we went then and we drove for at least an hour colonel lysander stark had said that it was only seven miles but i should think from the rate that we seemed to go and from the time that we took that it must have been nearer twelve he sat at my side in silence all the time and i was aware more than once when i glanced in his direction that he was looking at me with great intensity the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world for we lurched and jolted terribly i tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were but they were made of frosted glass and i could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light now and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey but the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the conversation soon flagged at last however the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a graveldrive and the carriage came to a stand colonel lysander stark sprang out and as i followed after him pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us we stepped as it were right out of the carriage and into the hall so that i failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away  it was pitch dark inside the house and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage and a long golden bar of light shot out in our direction it grew broader and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand which she held above her head pushing her face forward and peering at us i could see that she was pretty and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich material she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand colonel stark went up to her whispered something in her ear and then pushing her back into the room from whence she had come he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand  perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes said he throwing open another door it was a quiet little plainly furnished room with a round table in the centre on which several german books were scattered colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door i shall not keep you waiting an instant said he and vanished into the darkness  i glanced at the books upon the table and in spite of my ignorance of german i could see that two of them were treatises on science the others being volumes of poetry then i walked across to the window hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the countryside but an oak shutter heavily barred was folded across it it was a wonderfully silent house there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage but otherwise everything was deadly still a vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me who were these german people and what were they doing living in this strange outoftheway place and where was the place i was ten miles or so from eyford that was all i knew but whether north south east or west i had no idea for that matter reading and possibly other large towns were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded after all yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness that we were in the country i paced up and down the room humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that i was thoroughly earning my fiftyguinea fee  suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness the door of my room swung slowly open the woman was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind her the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart she held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few whispered words of broken english at me her eyes glancing back like those of a frightened horse into the gloom behind her  i would go said she trying hard as it seemed to me to speak calmly i would go i should not stay here there is no good for you to do  but madam said i i have not yet done what i came for i cannot possibly leave until i have seen the machine  it is not worth your while to wait she went on you can pass through the door no one hinders and then seeing that i smiled and shook my head she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward with her hands wrung together for the love of heaven she whispered get away from here before it is too late  but i am somewhat headstrong by nature and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way i thought of my fiftyguinea fee of my wearisome journey and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me was it all to go for nothing why should i slink away without having carried out my commission and without the payment which was my due this woman might for all i knew be a monomaniac with a stout bearing therefore though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs she listened for an instant threw up her hands with a despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come  the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin who was introduced to me as mr ferguson  this is my secretary and manager said the colonel by the way i was under the impression that i left this door shut just now i fear that you have felt the draught  on the contrary said i i opened the door myself because i felt the room to be a little close  he shot one of his suspicious looks at me perhaps we had better proceed to business then said he mr ferguson and i will take you up to see the machine  i had better put my hat on i suppose  oh no it is in the house  what you dig fullersearth in the house  no no this is only where we compress it but never mind that all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it  we went upstairs together the colonel first with the lamp the fat manager and i behind him it was a labyrinth of an old house with corridors passages narrow winding staircases and little low doors the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor while the plaster was peeling off the walls and the damp was breaking through in green unhealthy blotches i tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible but i had not forgotten the warnings of the lady even though i disregarded them and i kept a keen eye upon my two companions ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellowcountryman  colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door which he unlocked within was a small square room in which the three of us could hardly get at one time ferguson remained outside and the colonel ushered me in  we are now said he actually within the hydraulic press and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you the machine goes readily enough but there is some stiffness in the working of it and it has lost a little of its force perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right  i took the lamp from him and i examined the machine very thoroughly it was indeed a gigantic one and capable of exercising enormous pressure when i passed outside however and pressed down the levers which controlled it i knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders an examination showed that one of the indiarubber bands which was round the head of a drivingrod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked this was clearly the cause of the loss of power and i pointed it out to my companions who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right when i had made it clear to them i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity it was obvious at a glance that the story of the fullersearth was the merest fabrication for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose the walls were of wood but the floor consisted of a large iron trough and when i came to examine it i could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it i had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me  what are you doing there he asked  i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me i was admiring your fullersearth said i i think that i should be better able to advise you as to your machine if i knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used  the instant that i uttered the words i regretted the rashness of my speech his face set hard and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes  very well said he you shall know all about the machine he took a step backward slammed the little door and turned the key in the lock i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle but it was quite secure and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves hullo i yelled hullo colonel let me out  and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder he had set the engine at work the lamp still stood upon the floor where i had placed it when examining the trough by its light i saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me slowly jerkily but as none knew better than myself with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp i threw myself screaming against the door and dragged with my nails at the lock i implored the colonel to let me out but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head and with my hand upraised i could feel its hard rough surface then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it if i lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap easier the other way perhaps and yet had i the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me already i was unable to stand erect when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart  i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron the walls were of wood as i gave a last hurried glance around i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward for an instant i could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death the next instant i threw myself through and lay halffainting upon the other side the panel had closed again behind me but the crash of the lamp and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal told me how narrow had been my escape  i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist and i found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand while she held a candle in her right it was the same good friend whose warning i had so foolishly rejected  come come she cried breathlessly they will be here in a moment they will see that you are not there oh do not waste the soprecious time but come  this time at least i did not scorn her advice i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair the latter led to another broad passage and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices one answering the other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath my guide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her wits end then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon was shining brightly  it is your only chance said she it is high but it may be that you can jump it  as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage and i saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butchers cleaver in the other i rushed across the bedroom flung open the window and looked out how quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight and it could not be more than thirty feet down i clambered out upon the sill but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me if she were illused then at any risks i was determined to go back to her assistance the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door pushing his way past her but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back  fritz fritz she cried in english remember your promise after the last time you said it should not be again he will be silent oh he will be silent  you are mad elise he shouted struggling to break away from her you will be the ruin of us he has seen too much let me pass i say he dashed her to one side and rushing to the window cut at me with his heavy weapon i had let myself go and was hanging by the hands to the sill when his blow fell i was conscious of a dull pain my grip loosened and i fell into the garden below  i was shaken but not hurt by the fall so i picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as i could run for i understood that i was far from being out of danger yet suddenly however as i ran a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me i glanced down at my hand which was throbbing painfully and then for the first time saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rosebushes  how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell it must have been a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was breaking when i came to myself my clothes were all sodden with dew and my coatsleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my nights adventure and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers but to my astonishment when i came to look round me neither house nor garden were to be seen i had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road and just a little lower down was a long building which proved upon my approaching it to be the very station at which i had arrived upon the previous night were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream  half dazed i went into the station and asked about the morning train there would be one to reading in less than an hour the same porter was on duty i found as had been there when i arrived i inquired of him whether he had ever heard of colonel lysander stark the name was strange to him had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me no he had not was there a policestation anywhere near there was one about three miles off  it was too far for me to go weak and ill as i was i determined to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the police it was a little past six when i arrived so i went first to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here i put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise  we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings  here is an advertisement which will interest you said he it appeared in all the papers about a year ago listen to this  lost on the 9th inst mr jeremiah hayling aged twentysix a hydraulic engineer left his lodgings at ten oclock at night and has not been heard of since was dressed in etc etc ha that represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled i fancy  good heavens cried my patient then that explains what the girl said  undoubtedly it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game like those outandout pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship well every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford  some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together bound from reading to the little berkshire village there were sherlock holmes the hydraulic engineer inspector bradstreet of scotland yard a plainclothes man and myself bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford for its centre  there you are said he that circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village the place we want must be somewhere near that line you said ten miles i think sir  it was an hours good drive  and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious  they must have done so i have a confused memory too of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere  what i cannot understand said i is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden perhaps the villain was softened by the womans entreaties  i hardly think that likely i never saw a more inexorable face in my life  oh we shall soon clear up all that said bradstreet well i have drawn my circle and i only wish i knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found  i think i could lay my finger on it said holmes quietly  really now cried the inspector you have formed your opinion come now we shall see who agrees with you i say it is south for the country is more deserted there  and i say east said my patient  i am for west remarked the plainclothes man there are several quiet little villages up there  and i am for north said i because there are no hills there and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any  come cried the inspector laughing its a very pretty diversity of opinion we have boxed the compass among us who do you give your casting vote to  you are all wrong  but we cant all be  oh yes you can this is my point he placed his finger in the centre of the circle this is where we shall find them  but the twelvemile drive gasped hatherley  six out and six back nothing simpler you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in how could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads  indeed it is a likely ruse enough observed bradstreet thoughtfully of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang  none at all said holmes they are coiners on a large scale and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver  we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work said the inspector they have been turning out halfcrowns by the thousand we even traced them as far as reading but could get no farther for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands but now thanks to this lucky chance i think that we have got them right enough  but the inspector was mistaken for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice as we rolled into eyford station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape  a house on fire asked bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way  yes sir said the stationmaster  when did it break out  i hear that it was during the night sir but it has got worse and the whole place is in a blaze  whose house is it  dr bechers  tell me broke in the engineer is dr becher a german very thin with a long sharp nose  the stationmaster laughed heartily no sir dr becher is an englishman and there isnt a man in the parish who has a betterlined waistcoat but he has a gentleman staying with him a patient as i understand who is a foreigner and he looks as if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm  the stationmaster had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire the road topped a low hill and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us spouting fire at every chink and window while in the garden in front three fireengines were vainly striving to keep the flames under  thats it cried hatherley in intense excitement there is the graveldrive and there are the rosebushes where i lay that second window is the one that i jumped from  well at least said holmes you have had your revenge upon them there can be no question that it was your oillamp which when it was crushed in the press set fire to the wooden walls though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night though i very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now  and holmes fears came to be realised for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman the sinister german or the morose englishman early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared and even holmes ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts  the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a windowsill of the second floor about sunset however their efforts were at last successful and they subdued the flames but not before the roof had fallen in and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that save some twisted cylinders and iron piping not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an outhouse but no coins were to be found which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to  how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould which told us a very plain tale he had evidently been carried down by two persons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones on the whole it was most probable that the silent englishman being less bold or less murderous than his companion had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger  well said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to london it has been a pretty business for me i have lost my thumb and i have lost a fiftyguinea fee and what have i gained  experience said holmes laughing indirectly it may be of value you know you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence     x the adventure of the noble bachelor   the lord st simon marriage and its curious termination have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves fresh scandals have eclipsed it and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this fouryearold drama as i have reason to believe however that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public and as my friend sherlock holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up i feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode  it was a few weeks before my own marriage during the days when i was still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him i had remained indoors all day for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain with high autumnal winds and the jezail bullet which i had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence with my body in one easychair and my legs upon another i had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last saturated with the news of the day i tossed them all aside and lay listless watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friends noble correspondent could be  here is a very fashionable epistle i remarked as he entered your morning letters if i remember right were from a fishmonger and a tidewaiter  yes my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety he answered smiling and the humbler are usually the more interesting this looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie  he broke the seal and glanced over the contents  oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all  not social then  no distinctly professional  and from a noble client  one of the highest in england  my dear fellow i congratulate you  i assure you watson without affectation that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case it is just possible however that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation you have been reading the papers diligently of late have you not  it looks like it said i ruefully pointing to a huge bundle in the corner i have had nothing else to do  it is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to post me up i read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column the latter is always instructive but if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about lord st simon and his wedding  oh yes with the deepest interest  that is well the letter which i hold in my hand is from lord st simon i will read it to you and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter this is what he says       my dear mr sherlock holmeslord backwater tells me that i may     place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion i have     determined therefore to call upon you and to consult you in     reference to the very painful event which has occurred in     connection with my wedding mr lestrade of scotland yard is     acting already in the matter but he assures me that he sees no     objection to your cooperation and that he even thinks that it     might be of some assistance i will call at four oclock in the     afternoon and should you have any other engagement at that time     i hope that you will postpone it as this matter is of paramount     importance yours faithfully       robert st simon   it is dated from grosvenor mansions written with a quill pen and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger remarked holmes as he folded up the epistle  he says four oclock it is three now he will be here in an hour  then i have just time with your assistance to get clear upon the subject turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time while i take a glance as to who our client is he picked a redcovered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece here he is said he sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee lord robert walsingham de vere st simon second son of the duke of balmoral hum arms  azure three caltrops in chief over a fess sable born in 1846 hes fortyone years of age which is mature for marriage was undersecretary for the colonies in a late administration the duke his father was at one time secretary for foreign affairs they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent and tudor on the distaff side ha well there is nothing very instructive in all this i think that i must turn to you watson for something more solid  i have very little difficulty in finding what i want said i for the facts are quite recent and the matter struck me as remarkable i feared to refer them to you however as i knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters  oh you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square furniture van that is quite cleared up nowthough indeed it was obvious from the first pray give me the results of your newspaper selections  here is the first notice which i can find it is in the personal column of the morning post and dates as you see some weeks back  a marriage has been arranged it says and will if rumour is correct very shortly take place between lord robert st simon second son of the duke of balmoral and miss hatty doran the only daughter of aloysius doran esq of san francisco cal usa that is all  terse and to the point remarked holmes stretching his long thin legs towards the fire  there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week ah here it is  there will soon be a call for protection in the marriage  market for the present freetrade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic an important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders lord st simon who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little gods arrows has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty doran the fascinating daughter of a california millionaire miss doran whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the westbury house festivities is an only child and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures with expectancies for the future as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years and as lord st simon has no property of his own save the small estate of birchmoor it is obvious that the californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a british peeress  anything else asked holmes yawning  oh yes plenty then there is another note in the morning post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one that it would be at st georges hanover square that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited and that the party would return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been taken by mr aloysius doran two days laterthat is on wednesday lastthere is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord backwaters place near petersfield those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride  before the what asked holmes with a start  the vanishing of the lady  when did she vanish then  at the wedding breakfast  indeed this is more interesting than it promised to be quite dramatic in fact  yes it struck me as being a little out of the common  they often vanish before the ceremony and occasionally during the honeymoon but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this pray let me have the details  i warn you that they are very incomplete  perhaps we may make them less so  such as they are they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday which i will read to you it is headed singular occurrence at a fashionable wedding   the family of lord robert st simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding the ceremony as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday occurred on the previous morning but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about in spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation  the ceremony which was performed at st georges hanover square was a very quiet one no one being present save the father of the bride mr aloysius doran the duchess of balmoral lord backwater lord eustace and lady clara st simon the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom and lady alicia whittington the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of mr aloysius doran at lancaster gate where breakfast had been prepared it appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman whose name has not been ascertained who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party alleging that she had some claim upon lord st simon it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman the bride who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption had sat down to breakfast with the rest when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room her prolonged absence having caused some comment her father followed her but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant caught up an ulster and bonnet and hurried down to the passage one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled but had refused to credit that it was his mistress believing her to be with the company on ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared mr aloysius doran in conjunction with the bridegroom instantly put themselves in communication with the police and very energetic inquiries are being made which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business up to a late hour last night however nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady there are rumours of foul play in the matter and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance in the belief that from jealousy or some other motive she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride  and is that all  only one little item in another of the morning papers but it is a suggestive one  and it is  that miss flora millar the lady who had caused the disturbance has actually been arrested it appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the allegro and that she has known the bridegroom for some years there are no further particulars and the whole case is in your hands nowso far as it has been set forth in the public press  and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be i would not have missed it for worlds but there is a ring at the bell watson and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four i have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client do not dream of going watson for i very much prefer having a witness if only as a check to my own memory  lord robert st simon announced our pageboy throwing open the door a gentleman entered with a pleasant cultured face highnosed and pale with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth and with the steady wellopened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed his manner was brisk and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked his hair too as he swept off his very curlybrimmed hat was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top as to his dress it was careful to the verge of foppishness with high collar black frockcoat white waistcoat yellow gloves patentleather shoes and lightcoloured gaiters he advanced slowly into the room turning his head from left to right and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses  goodday lord st simon said holmes rising and bowing pray take the basketchair this is my friend and colleague dr watson draw up a little to the fire and we will talk this matter over  a most painful matter to me as you can most readily imagine mr holmes i have been cut to the quick i understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort sir though i presume that they were hardly from the same class of society  no i am descending  i beg pardon  my last client of the sort was a king  oh really i had no idea and which king  the king of scandinavia  what had he lost his wife  you can understand said holmes suavely that i extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to you in yours  of course very right very right im sure i beg pardon as to my own case i am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion  thank you i have already learned all that is in the public prints nothing more i presume that i may take it as correctthis article for example as to the disappearance of the bride  lord st simon glanced over it yes it is correct as far as it goes  but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion i think that i may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you  pray do so  when did you first meet miss hatty doran  in san francisco a year ago  you were travelling in the states  yes  did you become engaged then  no  but you were on a friendly footing  i was amused by her society and she could see that i was amused  her father is very rich  he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope  and how did he make his money  in mining he had nothing a few years ago then he struck gold invested it and came up by leaps and bounds  now what is your own impression as to the young ladysyour wifes character  the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire you see mr holmes said he my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man during that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains so that her education has come from nature rather than from the schoolmaster she is what we call in england a tomboy with a strong nature wild and free unfettered by any sort of traditions she is impetuousvolcanic i was about to say she is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions on the other hand i would not have given her the name which i have the honour to bearhe gave a little stately coughhad i not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman i believe that she is capable of heroic selfsacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her  have you her photograph  i brought this with me he opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman it was not a photograph but an ivory miniature and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair the large dark eyes and the exquisite mouth holmes gazed long and earnestly at it then he closed the locket and handed it back to lord st simon  the young lady came to london then and you renewed your acquaintance  yes her father brought her over for this last london season i met her several times became engaged to her and have now married her  she brought i understand a considerable dowry  a fair dowry not more than is usual in my family  and this of course remains to you since the marriage is a fait accompli  i really have made no inquiries on the subject  very naturally not did you see miss doran on the day before the wedding  yes  was she in good spirits  never better she kept talking of what we should do in our future lives  indeed that is very interesting and on the morning of the wedding  she was as bright as possibleat least until after the ceremony  and did you observe any change in her then  well to tell the truth i saw then the first signs that i had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp the incident however was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case  pray let us have it for all that  oh it is childish she dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry she was passing the front pew at the time and it fell over into the pew there was a moments delay but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall yet when i spoke to her of the matter she answered me abruptly and in the carriage on our way home she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause  indeed you say that there was a gentleman in the pew some of the general public were present then  oh yes it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open  this gentleman was not one of your wifes friends  no no i call him a gentleman by courtesy but he was quite a commonlooking person i hardly noticed his appearance but really i think that we are wandering rather far from the point  lady st simon then returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it what did she do on reentering her fathers house  i saw her in conversation with her maid  and who is her maid  alice is her name she is an american and came from california with her  a confidential servant  a little too much so it seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties still of course in america they look upon these things in a different way  how long did she speak to this alice  oh a few minutes i had something else to think of  you did not overhear what they said  lady st simon said something about jumping a claim she was accustomed to use slang of the kind i have no idea what she meant  american slang is very expressive sometimes and what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid  she walked into the breakfastroom  on your arm  no alone she was very independent in little matters like that then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room she never came back  but this maid alice as i understand deposes that she went to her room covered her brides dress with a long ulster put on a bonnet and went out  quite so and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in company with flora millar a woman who is now in custody and who had already made a disturbance at mr dorans house that morning  ah yes i should like a few particulars as to this young lady and your relations to her  lord st simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows we have been on a friendly footing for some yearsi may say on a very friendly footing she used to be at the allegro i have not treated her ungenerously and she had no just cause of complaint against me but you know what women are mr holmes flora was a dear little thing but exceedingly hotheaded and devotedly attached to me she wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that i was about to be married and to tell the truth the reason why i had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that i feared lest there might be a scandal in the church she came to mr dorans door just after we returned and she endeavoured to push her way in uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife and even threatening her but i had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort and i had two police fellows there in private clothes who soon pushed her out again she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row  did your wife hear all this  no thank goodness she did not  and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards  yes that is what mr lestrade of scotland yard looks upon as so serious it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her  well it is a possible supposition  you think so too  i did not say a probable one but you do not yourself look upon this as likely  i do not think flora would hurt a fly  still jealousy is a strange transformer of characters pray what is your own theory as to what took place  well really i came to seek a theory not to propound one i have given you all the facts since you ask me however i may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife  in short that she had become suddenly deranged  well really when i consider that she has turned her backi will not say upon me but upon so much that many have aspired to without successi can hardly explain it in any other fashion  well certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis said holmes smiling and now lord st simon i think that i have nearly all my data may i ask whether you were seated at the breakfasttable so that you could see out of the window  we could see the other side of the road and the park  quite so then i do not think that i need to detain you longer i shall communicate with you  should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem said our client rising  i have solved it  eh what was that  i say that i have solved it  where then is my wife  that is a detail which i shall speedily supply  lord st simon shook his head i am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine he remarked and bowing in a stately oldfashioned manner he departed  it is very good of lord st simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own said sherlock holmes laughing i think that i shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this crossquestioning i had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room  my dear holmes  i have notes of several similar cases though none as i remarked before which were quite as prompt my whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing as when you find a trout in the milk to quote thoreaus example  but i have heard all that you have heard  without however the knowledge of preexisting cases which serves me so well there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back and something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the francoprussian war it is one of these casesbut hullo here is lestrade goodafternoon lestrade you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are cigars in the box  the official detective was attired in a peajacket and cravat which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand with a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him  whats up then asked holmes with a twinkle in his eye you look dissatisfied  and i feel dissatisfied it is this infernal st simon marriage case i can make neither head nor tail of the business  really you surprise me  who ever heard of such a mixed affair every clue seems to slip through my fingers i have been at work upon it all day  and very wet it seems to have made you said holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the peajacket  yes i have been dragging the serpentine  in heavens name what for  in search of the body of lady st simon  sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily  have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain he asked  why what do you mean  because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other  lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion i suppose you know all about it he snarled  well i have only just heard the facts but my mind is made up  oh indeed then you think that the serpentine plays no part in the matter  i think it very unlikely  then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it he opened his bag as he spoke and tumbled onto the floor a weddingdress of watered silk a pair of white satin shoes and a brides wreath and veil all discoloured and soaked in water there said he putting a new weddingring upon the top of the pile there is a little nut for you to crack master holmes  oh indeed said my friend blowing blue rings into the air you dragged them from the serpentine  no they were found floating near the margin by a parkkeeper they have been identified as her clothes and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off  by the same brilliant reasoning every mans body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe and pray what did you hope to arrive at through this  at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance  i am afraid that you will find it difficult  are you indeed now cried lestrade with some bitterness i am afraid holmes that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences you have made two blunders in as many minutes this dress does implicate miss flora millar  and how  in the dress is a pocket in the pocket is a cardcase in the cardcase is a note and here is the very note he slapped it down upon the table in front of him listen to this  you will see me when all is ready come at once f h m now my theory all along has been that lady st simon was decoyed away by flora millar and that she with confederates no doubt was responsible for her disappearance here signed with her initials is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach  very good lestrade said holmes laughing you really are very fine indeed let me see it he took up the paper in a listless way but his attention instantly became riveted and he gave a little cry of satisfaction this is indeed important said he  ha you find it so  extremely so i congratulate you warmly  lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look why he shrieked youre looking at the wrong side  on the contrary this is the right side  the right side youre mad here is the note written in pencil over here  and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill which interests me deeply  theres nothing in it i looked at it before said lestrade oct 4th rooms 8s breakfast 2s 6d cocktail 1s lunch 2s 6d glass sherry 8d i see nothing in that  very likely not it is most important all the same as to the note it is important also or at least the initials are so i congratulate you again  ive wasted time enough said lestrade rising i believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories goodday mr holmes and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first he gathered up the garments thrust them into the bag and made for the door  just one hint to you lestrade drawled holmes before his rival vanished i will tell you the true solution of the matter lady st simon is a myth there is not and there never has been any such person  lestrade looked sadly at my companion then he turned to me tapped his forehead three times shook his head solemnly and hurried away  he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose to put on his overcoat there is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work he remarked so i think watson that i must leave you to your papers for a little  it was after five oclock when sherlock holmes left me but i had no time to be lonely for within an hour there arrived a confectioners man with a very large flat box this he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him and presently to my very great astonishment a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodginghouse mahogany there were a couple of brace of cold woodcock a pheasant a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles having laid out all these luxuries my two visitors vanished away like the genii of the arabian nights with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address  just before nine oclock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the room his features were gravely set but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions  they have laid the supper then he said rubbing his hands  you seem to expect company they have laid for five  yes i fancy we may have some company dropping in said he i am surprised that lord st simon has not already arrived ha i fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs  it was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features  my messenger reached you then asked holmes  yes and i confess that the contents startled me beyond measure have you good authority for what you say  the best possible  lord st simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead  what will the duke say he murmured when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation  it is the purest accident i cannot allow that there is any humiliation  ah you look on these things from another standpoint  i fail to see that anyone is to blame i can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted having no mother she had no one to advise her at such a crisis  it was a slight sir a public slight said lord st simon tapping his fingers upon the table  you must make allowance for this poor girl placed in so unprecedented a position  i will make no allowance i am very angry indeed and i have been shamefully used  i think that i heard a ring said holmes yes there are steps on the landing if i cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter lord st simon i have brought an advocate here who may be more successful he opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman lord st simon said he allow me to introduce you to mr and mrs francis hay moulton the lady i think you have already met  at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frockcoat a picture of offended dignity the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him but he still refused to raise his eyes it was as well for his resolution perhaps for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist  youre angry robert said she well i guess you have every cause to be  pray make no apology to me said lord st simon bitterly  oh yes i know that i have treated you real bad and that i should have spoken to you before i went but i was kind of rattled and from the time when i saw frank here again i just didnt know what i was doing or saying i only wonder i didnt fall down and do a faint right there before the altar  perhaps mrs moulton you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter  if i may give an opinion remarked the strange gentleman weve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already for my part i should like all europe and america to hear the rights of it he was a small wiry sunburnt man cleanshaven with a sharp face and alert manner  then ill tell our story right away said the lady frank here and i met in 84 in mcquires camp near the rockies where pa was working a claim we were engaged to each other frank and i but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile while poor frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing the richer pa grew the poorer was frank so at last pa wouldnt hear of our engagement lasting any longer and he took me away to frisco frank wouldnt throw up his hand though so he followed me there and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it it would only have made him mad to know so we just fixed it all up for ourselves frank said that he would go and make his pile too and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa so then i promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived why shouldnt we be married right away then said he and then i will feel sure of you and i wont claim to be your husband until i come back well we talked it over and he had fixed it all up so nicely with a clergyman all ready in waiting that we just did it right there and then frank went off to seek his fortune and i went back to pa  the next i heard of frank was that he was in montana and then he went prospecting in arizona and then i heard of him from new mexico after that came a long newspaper story about how a miners camp had been attacked by apache indians and there was my franks name among the killed i fainted dead away and i was very sick for months after pa thought i had a decline and took me to half the doctors in frisco not a word of news came for a year and more so that i never doubted that frank was really dead then lord st simon came to frisco and we came to london and a marriage was arranged and pa was very pleased but i felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor frank  still if i had married lord st simon of course id have done my duty by him we cant command our love but we can our actions i went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be but you may imagine what i felt when just as i came to the altar rails i glanced back and saw frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew i thought it was his ghost at first but when i looked again there he was still with a kind of question in his eyes as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him i wonder i didnt drop i know that everything was turning round and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear i didnt know what to do should i stop the service and make a scene in the church i glanced at him again and he seemed to know what i was thinking for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still then i saw him scribble on a piece of paper and i knew that he was writing me a note as i passed his pew on the way out i dropped my bouquet over to him and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers it was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so of course i never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him and i determined to do just whatever he might direct  when i got back i told my maid who had known him in california and had always been his friend i ordered her to say nothing but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready i know i ought to have spoken to lord st simon but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards i hadnt been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park i slipped out put on my things and followed him some woman came talking something or other about lord st simon to meseemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage alsobut i managed to get away from her and soon overtook frank we got into a cab together and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting frank had been a prisoner among the apaches had escaped came on to frisco found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to england followed me there and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding  i saw it in a paper explained the american it gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived  then we had a talk as to what we should do and frank was all for openness but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to vanish away and never see any of them againjust sending a line to pa perhaps to show him that i was alive it was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfasttable and waiting for me to come back so frank took my weddingclothes and things and made a bundle of them so that i should not be traced and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them it is likely that we should have gone on to paris tomorrow only that this good gentleman mr holmes came round to us this evening though how he found us is more than i can think and he showed us very clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord st simon alone and so we came right away round to his rooms at once now robert you have heard it all and i am very sorry if i have given you pain and i hope that you do not think very meanly of me  lord st simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative  excuse me he said but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner  then you wont forgive me you wont shake hands before i go  oh certainly if it would give you any pleasure he put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him  i had hoped suggested holmes that you would have joined us in a friendly supper  i think that there you ask a little too much responded his lordship i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments but i can hardly be expected to make merry over them i think that with your permission i will now wish you all a very goodnight he included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room  then i trust that you at least will honour me with your company said sherlock holmes it is always a joy to meet an american mr moulton for i am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in fargone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same worldwide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes  the case has been an interesting one remarked holmes when our visitors had left us because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady and nothing stranger than the result when viewed for instance by mr lestrade of scotland yard  you were not yourself at fault at all then  from the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home obviously something had occurred during the morning then to cause her to change her mind what could that something be she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom had she seen someone then if she had it must be someone from america because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely you see we have already arrived by a process of exclusion at the idea that she might have seen an american then who could this american be and why should he possess so much influence over her it might be a lover it might be a husband her young womanhood had i knew been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions so far i had got before i ever heard lord st simons narrative when he told us of a man in a pew of the change in the brides manner of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet of her resort to her confidential maid and of her very significant allusion to claimjumpingwhich in miners parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim tothe whole situation became absolutely clear she had gone off with a man and the man was either a lover or was a previous husbandthe chances being in favour of the latter  and how in the world did you find them  it might have been difficult but friend lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know the initials were of course of the highest importance but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels  how did you deduce the select  by the select prices eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels there are not many in london which charge at that rate in the second one which i visited in northumberland avenue i learned by an inspection of the book that francis h moulton an american gentleman had left only the day before and on looking over the entries against him i came upon the very items which i had seen in the duplicate bill his letters were to be forwarded to 226 gordon square so thither i travelled and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home i ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to lord st simon in particular i invited them to meet him here and as you see i made him keep the appointment  but with no very good result i remarked his conduct was certainly not very gracious  ah watson said holmes smiling perhaps you would not be very gracious either if after all the trouble of wooing and wedding you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune i think that we may judge lord st simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position draw your chair up and hand me my violin for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings     xi the adventure of the beryl coronet   holmes said i as i stood one morning in our bowwindow looking down the street here is a madman coming along it seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone  my friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressinggown looking over my shoulder it was a bright crisp february morning and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground shimmering brightly in the wintry sun down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic but at either side and on the heapedup edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell the grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped but was still dangerously slippery so that there were fewer passengers than usual indeed from the direction of the metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention  he was a man of about fifty tall portly and imposing with a massive strongly marked face and a commanding figure he was dressed in a sombre yet rich style in black frockcoat shining hat neat brown gaiters and wellcut pearlgrey trousers yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features for he was running hard with occasional little springs such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs as he ran he jerked his hands up and down waggled his head and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions  what on earth can be the matter with him i asked he is looking up at the numbers of the houses  i believe that he is coming here said holmes rubbing his hands  here  yes i rather think he is coming to consult me professionally i think that i recognise the symptoms ha did i not tell you as he spoke the man puffing and blowing rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging  a few moments later he was in our room still puffing still gesticulating but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity for a while he could not get his words out but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason then suddenly springing to his feet he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easychair and sitting beside him patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ  you have come to me to tell your story have you not said he you are fatigued with your haste pray wait until you have recovered yourself and then i shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me  the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest fighting against his emotion then he passed his handkerchief over his brow set his lips tight and turned his face towards us  no doubt you think me mad said he  i see that you have had some great trouble responded holmes  god knows i havea trouble which is enough to unseat my reason so sudden and so terrible is it public disgrace i might have faced although i am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain private affliction also is the lot of every man but the two coming together and in so frightful a form have been enough to shake my very soul besides it is not i alone the very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair  pray compose yourself sir said holmes and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you  my name answered our visitor is probably familiar to your ears i am alexander holder of the banking firm of holder & stevenson of threadneedle street  the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the city of london what could have happened then to bring one of the foremost citizens of london to this most pitiable pass we waited all curiosity until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story  i feel that time is of value said he that is why i hastened here when the police inspector suggested that i should secure your cooperation i came to baker street by the underground and hurried from there on foot for the cabs go slowly through this snow that is why i was so out of breath for i am a man who takes very little exercise i feel better now and i will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as i can  it is of course well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors one of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans where the security is unimpeachable we have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures libraries or plate  yesterday morning i was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks i started when i saw the name for it was that of none other thanwell perhaps even to you i had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earthone of the highest noblest most exalted names in england i was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted when he entered to say so but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task  mr holder said he i have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money  the firm does so when the security is good i answered  it is absolutely essential to me said he that i should have £ 50000 at once i could of course borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends but i much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself in my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place ones self under obligations  for how long may i ask do you want this sum i asked  next monday i have a large sum due to me and i shall then most certainly repay what you advance with whatever interest you think it right to charge but it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once  i should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse said i were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear if on the other hand i am to do it in the name of the firm then in justice to my partner i must insist that even in your case every businesslike precaution should be taken  i should much prefer to have it so said he raising up a square black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair you have doubtless heard of the beryl coronet  one of the most precious public possessions of the empire said i  precisely he opened the case and there imbedded in soft fleshcoloured velvet lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named there are thirtynine enormous beryls said he and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable the lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which i have asked i am prepared to leave it with you as my security  i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client  you doubt its value he asked  not at all i only doubt  the propriety of my leaving it you may set your mind at rest about that i should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that i should be able in four days to reclaim it it is a pure matter of form is the security sufficient  ample  you understand mr holder that i am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which i have in you founded upon all that i have heard of you i rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but above all to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because i need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss for there are no beryls in the world to match these and it would be impossible to replace them i leave it with you however with every confidence and i shall call for it in person on monday morning  seeing that my client was anxious to leave i said no more but calling for my cashier i ordered him to pay over fifty £ 1000 notes when i was alone once more however with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me i could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me there could be no doubt that as it was a national possession a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it i already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it however it was too late to alter the matter now so i locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work  when evening came i felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me bankers safes had been forced before now and why should not mine be if so how terrible would be the position in which i should find myself i determined therefore that for the next few days i would always carry the case backward and forward with me so that it might never be really out of my reach with this intention i called a cab and drove out to my house at streatham carrying the jewel with me i did not breathe freely until i had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressingroom  and now a word as to my household mr holmes for i wish you to thoroughly understand the situation my groom and my page sleep out of the house and may be set aside altogether i have three maidservants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion another lucy parr the second waitingmaid has only been in my service a few months she came with an excellent character however and has always given me satisfaction she is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place that is the only drawback which we have found to her but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way  so much for the servants my family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it i am a widower and have an only son arthur he has been a disappointment to me mr holmesa grievous disappointment i have no doubt that i am myself to blame people tell me that i have spoiled him very likely i have when my dear wife died i felt that he was all i had to love i could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face i have never denied him a wish perhaps it would have been better for both of us had i been sterner but i meant it for the best  it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business but he was not of a business turn he was wild wayward and to speak the truth i could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money when he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club and there having charming manners he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits he learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance that he might settle his debts of honour he tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping but each time the influence of his friend sir george burnwell was enough to draw him back again  and indeed i could not wonder that such a man as sir george burnwell should gain an influence over him for he has frequently brought him to my house and i have found myself that i could hardly resist the fascination of his manner he is older than arthur a man of the world to his fingertips one who had been everywhere seen everything a brilliant talker and a man of great personal beauty yet when i think of him in cold blood far away from the glamour of his presence i am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which i have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted so i think and so too thinks my little mary who has a womans quick insight into character  and now there is only she to be described she is my niece but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world i adopted her and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter she is a sunbeam in my housesweet loving beautiful a wonderful manager and housekeeper yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be she is my right hand i do not know what i could do without her in only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes twice my boy has asked her to marry him for he loves her devotedly but each time she has refused him i think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she and that his marriage might have changed his whole life but now alas it is too lateforever too late  now mr holmes you know the people who live under my roof and i shall continue with my miserable story  when we were taking coffee in the drawingroom that night after dinner i told arthur and mary my experience and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof suppressing only the name of my client lucy parr who had brought in the coffee had i am sure left the room but i cannot swear that the door was closed mary and arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet but i thought it better not to disturb it  where have you put it asked arthur  in my own bureau  well i hope to goodness the house wont be burgled during the night said he  it is locked up i answered  oh any old key will fit that bureau when i was a youngster i have opened it myself with the key of the boxroom cupboard  he often had a wild way of talking so that i thought little of what he said he followed me to my room however that night with a very grave face  look here dad said he with his eyes cast down can you let me have £ 200  no i cannot i answered sharply i have been far too generous with you in money matters  you have been very kind said he but i must have this money or else i can never show my face inside the club again  and a very good thing too i cried  yes but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man said he i could not bear the disgrace i must raise the money in some way and if you will not let me have it then i must try other means  i was very angry for this was the third demand during the month you shall not have a farthing from me i cried on which he bowed and left the room without another word  when he was gone i unlocked my bureau made sure that my treasure was safe and locked it again then i started to go round the house to see that all was securea duty which i usually leave to mary but which i thought it well to perform myself that night as i came down the stairs i saw mary herself at the side window of the hall which she closed and fastened as i approached  tell me dad said she looking i thought a little disturbed did you give lucy the maid leave to go out tonight  certainly not  she came in just now by the back door i have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone but i think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped  you must speak to her in the morning or i will if you prefer it are you sure that everything is fastened  quite sure dad  then goodnight i kissed her and went up to my bedroom again where i was soon asleep  i am endeavouring to tell you everything mr holmes which may have any bearing upon the case but i beg that you will question me upon any point which i do not make clear  on the contrary your statement is singularly lucid  i come to a part of my story now in which i should wish to be particularly so i am not a very heavy sleeper and the anxiety in my mind tended no doubt to make me even less so than usual about two in the morning then i was awakened by some sound in the house it had ceased ere i was wide awake but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere i lay listening with all my ears suddenly to my horror there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room i slipped out of bed all palpitating with fear and peeped round the corner of my dressingroom door  arthur i screamed you villain you thief how dare you touch that coronet  the gas was half up as i had left it and my unhappy boy dressed only in his shirt and trousers was standing beside the light holding the coronet in his hands he appeared to be wrenching at it or bending it with all his strength at my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death i snatched it up and examined it one of the gold corners with three of the beryls in it was missing  you blackguard i shouted beside myself with rage you have destroyed it you have dishonoured me forever where are the jewels which you have stolen  stolen he cried  yes thief i roared shaking him by the shoulder  there are none missing there cannot be any missing said he  there are three missing and you know where they are must i call you a liar as well as a thief did i not see you trying to tear off another piece  you have called me names enough said he i will not stand it any longer i shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me i will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world  you shall leave it in the hands of the police i cried halfmad with grief and rage i shall have this matter probed to the bottom  you shall learn nothing from me said he with a passion such as i should not have thought was in his nature if you choose to call the police let the police find what they can  by this time the whole house was astir for i had raised my voice in my anger mary was the first to rush into my room and at the sight of the coronet and of arthurs face she read the whole story and with a scream fell down senseless on the ground i sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once when the inspector and a constable entered the house arthur who had stood sullenly with his arms folded asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft i answered that it had ceased to be a private matter but had become a public one since the ruined coronet was national property i was determined that the law should have its way in everything  at least said he you will not have me arrested at once it would be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the house for five minutes  that you may get away or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen said i and then realising the dreadful position in which i was placed i implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than i was at stake and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation he might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones  you may as well face the matter said i you have been caught in the act and no confession could make your guilt more heinous if you but make such reparation as is in your power by telling us where the beryls are all shall be forgiven and forgotten  keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it he answered turning away from me with a sneer i saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him there was but one way for it i called in the inspector and gave him into custody a search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems but no trace of them could be found nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats this morning he was removed to a cell and i after going through all the police formalities have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter the police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it you may go to any expense which you think necessary i have already offered a reward of £ 1000 my god what shall i do i have lost my honour my gems and my son in one night oh what shall i do  he put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words  sherlock holmes sat silent for some few minutes with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire  do you receive much company he asked  none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of arthurs sir george burnwell has been several times lately no one else i think  do you go out much in society  arthur does mary and i stay at home we neither of us care for it  that is unusual in a young girl  she is of a quiet nature besides she is not so very young she is fourandtwenty  this matter from what you say seems to have been a shock to her also  terrible she is even more affected than i  you have neither of you any doubt as to your sons guilt  how can we have when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands  i hardly consider that a conclusive proof was the remainder of the coronet at all injured  yes it was twisted  do you not think then that he might have been trying to straighten it  god bless you you are doing what you can for him and for me but it is too heavy a task what was he doing there at all if his purpose were innocent why did he not say so  precisely and if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie his silence appears to me to cut both ways there are several singular points about the case what did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep  they considered that it might be caused by arthurs closing his bedroom door  a likely story as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household what did they say then of the disappearance of these gems  they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them  have they thought of looking outside the house  yes they have shown extraordinary energy the whole garden has already been minutely examined  now my dear sir said holmes is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think it appeared to you to be a simple case to me it seems exceedingly complex consider what is involved by your theory you suppose that your son came down from his bed went at great risk to your dressingroom opened your bureau took out your coronet broke off by main force a small portion of it went off to some other place concealed three gems out of the thirtynine with such skill that nobody can find them and then returned with the other thirtysix into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered i ask you now is such a theory tenable  but what other is there cried the banker with a gesture of despair if his motives were innocent why does he not explain them  it is our task to find that out replied holmes so now if you please mr holder we will set off for streatham together and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details  my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition which i was eager enough to do for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened i confess that the guilt of the bankers son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father but still i had such faith in holmes judgment that i felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes sunk in the deepest thought our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs a short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank the modest residence of the great financier  fairbank was a goodsized square house of white stone standing back a little from the road a double carriagesweep with a snowclad lawn stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance on the right side was a small wooden thicket which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door and forming the tradesmens entrance on the left ran a lane which led to the stables and was not itself within the grounds at all being a public though little used thoroughfare holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house across the front down the tradesmens path and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane so long was he that mr holder and i went into the diningroom and waited by the fire until he should return we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in she was rather above the middle height slim with dark hair and eyes which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin i do not think that i have ever seen such deadly paleness in a womans face her lips too were bloodless but her eyes were flushed with crying as she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character with immense capacity for selfrestraint disregarding my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress  you have given orders that arthur should be liberated have you not dad she asked  no no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom  but i am so sure that he is innocent you know what womans instincts are i know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly  why is he silent then if he is innocent  who knows perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him  how could i help suspecting him when i actually saw him with the coronet in his hand  oh but he had only picked it up to look at it oh do do take my word for it that he is innocent let the matter drop and say no more it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison  i shall never let it drop until the gems are foundnever mary your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me far from hushing the thing up i have brought a gentleman down from london to inquire more deeply into it  this gentleman she asked facing round to me  no his friend he wished us to leave him alone he is round in the stable lane now  the stable lane she raised her dark eyebrows what can he hope to find there ah this i suppose is he i trust sir that you will succeed in proving what i feel sure is the truth that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime  i fully share your opinion and i trust with you that we may prove it returned holmes going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes i believe i have the honour of addressing miss mary holder might i ask you a question or two  pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up  you heard nothing yourself last night  nothing until my uncle here began to speak loudly i heard that and i came down  you shut up the windows and doors the night before did you fasten all the windows  yes  were they all fastened this morning  yes  you have a maid who has a sweetheart i think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him  yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawingroom and who may have heard uncles remarks about the coronet  i see you infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart and that the two may have planned the robbery  but what is the good of all these vague theories cried the banker impatiently when i have told you that i saw arthur with the coronet in his hands  wait a little mr holder we must come back to that about this girl miss holder you saw her return by the kitchen door i presume  yes when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i met her slipping in i saw the man too in the gloom  do you know him  oh yes he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round his name is francis prosper  he stood said holmes to the left of the doorthat is to say farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door  yes he did  and he is a man with a wooden leg  something like fear sprang up in the young ladys expressive black eyes why you are like a magician said she how do you know that she smiled but there was no answering smile in holmes thin eager face  i should be very glad now to go upstairs said he i shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again perhaps i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up  he walked swiftly round from one to the other pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens now we shall go upstairs said he at last  the bankers dressingroom was a plainly furnished little chamber with a grey carpet a large bureau and a long mirror holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock  which key was used to open it he asked  that which my son himself indicatedthat of the cupboard of the lumberroom  have you it here  that is it on the dressingtable  sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau  it is a noiseless lock said he it is no wonder that it did not wake you this case i presume contains the coronet we must have a look at it he opened the case and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table it was a magnificent specimen of the jewellers art and the thirtysix stones were the finest that i have ever seen at one side of the coronet was a cracked edge where a corner holding three gems had been torn away  now mr holder said holmes here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost might i beg that you will break it off  the banker recoiled in horror i should not dream of trying said he  then i will holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it but without result i feel it give a little said he but though i am exceptionally strong in the fingers it would take me all my time to break it an ordinary man could not do it now what do you think would happen if i did break it mr holder there would be a noise like a pistol shot do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it  i do not know what to think it is all dark to me  but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go what do you think miss holder  i confess that i still share my uncles perplexity  your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him  he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt  thank you we have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up with your permission mr holder i shall now continue my investigations outside  he went alone at his own request for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult for an hour or more he was at work returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever  i think that i have seen now all that there is to see mr holder said he i can serve you best by returning to my rooms  but the gems mr holmes where are they  i cannot tell  the banker wrung his hands i shall never see them again he cried and my son you give me hopes  my opinion is in no way altered  then for gods sake what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night  if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms tomorrow morning between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to make it clearer i understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you provided only that i get back the gems and that you place no limit on the sum i may draw  i would give my fortune to have them back  very good i shall look into the matter between this and then goodbye it is just possible that i may have to come over here again before evening  it was obvious to me that my companions mind was now made up about the case although what his conclusions were was more than i could even dimly imagine several times during our homeward journey i endeavoured to sound him upon the point but he always glided away to some other topic until at last i gave it over in despair it was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more he hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer with his collar turned up his shiny seedy coat his red cravat and his worn boots he was a perfect sample of the class  i think that this should do said he glancing into the glass above the fireplace i only wish that you could come with me watson but i fear that it wont do i may be on the trail in this matter or i may be following a willothewisp but i shall soon know which it is i hope that i may be back in a few hours he cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard sandwiched it between two rounds of bread and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition  i had just finished my tea when he returned evidently in excellent spirits swinging an old elasticsided boot in his hand he chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea  i only looked in as i passed said he i am going right on  where to  oh to the other side of the west end it may be some time before i get back dont wait up for me in case i should be late  how are you getting on  oh so so nothing to complain of i have been out to streatham since i saw you last but i did not call at the house it is a very sweet little problem and i would not have missed it for a good deal however i must not sit gossiping here but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self  i could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply his eyes twinkled and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks he hastened upstairs and a few minutes later i heard the slam of the hall door which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt  i waited until midnight but there was no sign of his return so i retired to my room it was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent so that his lateness caused me no surprise i do not know at what hour he came in but when i came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other as fresh and trim as possible  you will excuse my beginning without you watson said he but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning  why it is after nine now i answered i should not be surprised if that were he i thought i heard a ring  it was indeed our friend the financier i was shocked by the change which had come over him for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould was now pinched and fallen in while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter he entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before and he dropped heavily into the armchair which i pushed forward for him  i do not know what i have done to be so severely tried said he only two days ago i was a happy and prosperous man without a care in the world now i am left to a lonely and dishonoured age one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another my niece mary has deserted me  deserted you  yes her bed this morning had not been slept in her room was empty and a note for me lay upon the hall table i had said to her last night in sorrow and not in anger that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so it is to that remark that she refers in this note       my dearest unclei feel that i have brought trouble upon you     and that if i had acted differently this terrible misfortune might     never have occurred i cannot with this thought in my mind ever     again be happy under your roof and i feel that i must leave you     forever do not worry about my future for that is provided for     and above all do not search for me for it will be fruitless     labour and an illservice to me in life or in death i am ever     your loving       mary   what could she mean by that note mr holmes do you think it points to suicide  no no nothing of the kind it is perhaps the best possible solution i trust mr holder that you are nearing the end of your troubles  ha you say so you have heard something mr holmes you have learned something where are the gems  you would not think £ 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them  i would pay ten  that would be unnecessary three thousand will cover the matter and there is a little reward i fancy have you your chequebook here is a pen better make it out for £ 4000  with a dazed face the banker made out the required check holmes walked over to his desk took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it and threw it down upon the table  with a shriek of joy our client clutched it up  you have it he gasped i am saved i am saved  the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom  there is one other thing you owe mr holder said sherlock holmes rather sternly  owe he caught up a pen name the sum and i will pay it  no the debt is not to me you owe a very humble apology to that noble lad your son who has carried himself in this matter as i should be proud to see my own son do should i ever chance to have one  then it was not arthur who took them  i told you yesterday and i repeat today that it was not  you are sure of it then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known  he knows it already when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the story i told it to him on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me your news of this morning however may open his lips  for heavens sake tell me then what is this extraordinary mystery  i will do so and i will show you the steps by which i reached it and let me say to you first that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear  there has been an understanding between sir george burnwell and your niece mary they have now fled together  my mary impossible  it is unfortunately more than possible it is certain neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle he is one of the most dangerous men in englanda ruined gambler an absolutely desperate villain a man without heart or conscience your niece knew nothing of such men when he breathed his vows to her as he had done to a hundred before her she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart the devil knows best what he said but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening  i cannot and i will not believe it cried the banker with an ashen face  i will tell you then what occurred in your house last night your niece when you had as she thought gone to your room slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane his footmarks had pressed right through the snow so long had he stood there she told him of the coronet his wicked lust for gold kindled at the news and he bent her to his will i have no doubt that she loved you but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves and i think that she must have been one she had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants escapade with her woodenlegged lover which was all perfectly true  your boy arthur went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts in the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door so he rose and looking out was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressingroom petrified with astonishment the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair presently she emerged from the room again and in the light of the passagelamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands she passed down the stairs and he thrilling with horror ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath he saw her stealthily open the window hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom and then closing it once more hurry back to her room passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain  as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved but the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you and how allimportant it was to set it right he rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight sir george burnwell tried to get away but arthur caught him and there was a struggle between them your lad tugging at one side of the coronet and his opponent at the other in the scuffle your son struck sir george and cut him over the eye then something suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene  is it possible gasped the banker  you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands he took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her secret  and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet cried mr holder oh my god what a blind fool i have been and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle how cruelly i have misjudged him  when i arrived at the house continued holmes i at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me i knew that none had fallen since the evening before and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions i passed along the tradesmens path but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable just beyond it however at the far side of the kitchen door a woman had stood and talked with a man whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg i could even tell that they had been disturbed for the woman had run back swiftly to the door as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks while woodenleg had waited a little and then had gone away i thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart of whom you had already spoken to me and inquiry showed it was so i passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks which i took to be the police but when i got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me  there was a double line of tracks of a booted man and a second double line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son the first had walked both ways but the other had run swiftly and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot it was obvious that he had passed after the other i followed them up and found they led to the hall window where boots had worn all the snow away while waiting then i walked to the other end which was a hundred yards or more down the lane i saw where boots had faced round where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle and finally where a few drops of blood had fallen to show me that i was not mistaken boots had then run down the lane and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt when he came to the high road at the other end i found that the pavement had been cleared so there was an end to that clue  on entering the house however i examined as you remember the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens and i could at once see that someone had passed out i could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred a man had waited outside the window someone had brought the gems the deed had been overseen by your son he had pursued the thief had struggled with him they had each tugged at the coronet their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected he had returned with the prize but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent so far i was clear the question now was who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet  it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth now i knew that it was not you who had brought it down so there only remained your niece and the maids but if it were the maids why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place there could be no possible reason as he loved his cousin however there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secretthe more so as the secret was a disgraceful one when i remembered that you had seen her at that window and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again my conjecture became a certainty  and who could it be who was her confederate a lover evidently for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you i knew that you went out little and that your circle of friends was a very limited one but among them was sir george burnwell i had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women it must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems even though he knew that arthur had discovered him he might still flatter himself that he was safe for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family  well your own good sense will suggest what measures i took next i went in the shape of a loafer to sir georges house managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that his master had cut his head the night before and finally at the expense of six shillings made all sure by buying a pair of his castoff shoes with these i journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks  i saw an illdressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening said mr holder  precisely it was i i found that i had my man so i came home and changed my clothes it was a delicate part which i had to play then for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter i went and saw him at first of course he denied everything but when i gave him every particular that had occurred he tried to bluster and took down a lifepreserver from the wall i knew my man however and i clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike then he became a little more reasonable i told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held£ 1000 apiece that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown why dash it all said he ive let them go at six hundred for the three i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them on promising him that there would be no prosecution off i set to him and after much chaffering i got our stones at £ 1000 apiece then i looked in upon your son told him that all was right and eventually got to my bed about two oclock after what i may call a really hard days work  a day which has saved england from a great public scandal said the banker rising sir i cannot find words to thank you but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done your skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it and now i must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which i have done him as to what you tell me of poor mary it goes to my very heart not even your skill can inform me where she is now  i think that we may safely say returned holmes that she is wherever sir george burnwell is it is equally certain too that whatever her sins are they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment     xii the adventure of the copper beeches   to the man who loves art for its own sake remarked sherlock holmes tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the daily telegraph it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived it is pleasant to me to observe watson that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up and i am bound to say occasionally to embellish you have given prominence not so much to the many causes célèbres and sensational trials in which i have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made my special province  and yet said i smiling i cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records  you have erred perhaps he observed taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherrywood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative moodyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing  it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter i remarked with some coldness for i was repelled by the egotism which i had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friends singular character  no it is not selfishness or conceit said he answering as was his wont my thoughts rather than my words if i claim full justice for my art it is because it is an impersonal thinga thing beyond myself crime is common logic is rare therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell you have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales  it was a cold morning of the early spring and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at baker street a thick fog rolled down between the lines of duncoloured houses and the opposing windows loomed like dark shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal for the table had not been cleared yet sherlock holmes had been silent all the morning dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last having apparently given up his search he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings  at the same time he remarked after a pause during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in a fair proportion do not treat of crime in its legal sense at all the small matter in which i endeavoured to help the king of bohemia the singular experience of miss mary sutherland the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip and the incident of the noble bachelor were all matters which are outside the pale of the law but in avoiding the sensational i fear that you may have bordered on the trivial  the end may have been so i answered but the methods i hold to have been novel and of interest  pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unobservant public who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction but indeed if you are trivial i cannot blame you for the days of the great cases are past man or at least criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality as to my own little practice it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boardingschools i think that i have touched bottom at last however this note i had this morning marks my zeropoint i fancy read it he tossed a crumpled letter across to me  it was dated from montague place upon the preceding evening and ran thus       dear mr holmesi am very anxious to consult you as to whether i     should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to     me as governess i shall call at halfpast ten tomorrow if i do     not inconvenience you yours faithfully       violet hunter   do you know the young lady i asked  not i  it is halfpast ten now  yes and i have no doubt that is her ring  it may turn out to be of more interest than you think you remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle which appeared to be a mere whim at first developed into a serious investigation it may be so in this case also  well let us hope so but our doubts will very soon be solved for here unless i am much mistaken is the person in question  as he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room she was plainly but neatly dressed with a bright quick face freckled like a plovers egg and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world  you will excuse my troubling you i am sure said she as my companion rose to greet her but i have had a very strange experience and as i have no parents or relations of any sort from whom i could ask advice i thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what i should do  pray take a seat miss hunter i shall be happy to do anything that i can to serve you  i could see that holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client he looked her over in his searching fashion and then composed himself with his lids drooping and his fingertips together to listen to her story  i have been a governess for five years said she in the family of colonel spence munro but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at halifax in nova scotia and took his children over to america with him so that i found myself without a situation i advertised and i answered advertisements but without success at last the little money which i had saved began to run short and i was at my wits end as to what i should do  there is a wellknown agency for governesses in the west end called westaways and there i used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me westaway was the name of the founder of the business but it is really managed by miss stoper she sits in her own little office and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom and are then shown in one by one when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them  well when i called last week i was shown into the little office as usual but i found that miss stoper was not alone a prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered as i came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to miss stoper  that will do said he i could not ask for anything better capital capital he seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion he was such a comfortablelooking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him  you are looking for a situation miss he asked  yes sir  as governess  yes sir  and what salary do you ask  i had £ 4 a month in my last place with colonel spence munro  oh tut tut sweatingrank sweating he cried throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion how could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments  my accomplishments sir may be less than you imagine said i a little french a little german music and drawing  tut tut he cried this is all quite beside the question the point is have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady there it is in a nutshell if you have not you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country but if you have why then how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures your salary with me madam would commence at £ 100 a year  you may imagine mr holmes that to me destitute as i was such an offer seemed almost too good to be true the gentleman however seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face opened a pocketbook and took out a note  it is also my custom said he smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe  it seemed to me that i had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man as i was already in debt to my tradesmen the advance was a great convenience and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before i quite committed myself  may i ask where you live sir said i  hampshire charming rural place the copper beeches five miles on the far side of winchester it is the most lovely country my dear young lady and the dearest old countryhouse  and my duties sir i should be glad to know what they would be  one childone dear little romper just six years old oh if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper smack smack smack three gone before you could wink he leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again  i was a little startled at the nature of the childs amusement but the fathers laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking  my sole duties then i asked are to take charge of a single child  no no not the sole not the sole my dear young lady he cried your duty would be as i am sure your good sense would suggest to obey any little commands my wife might give provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey you see no difficulty heh  i should be happy to make myself useful  quite so in dress now for example we are faddy people you knowfaddy but kindhearted if you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you you would not object to our little whim heh  no said i considerably astonished at his words  or to sit here or sit there that would not be offensive to you  oh no  or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us  i could hardly believe my ears as you may observe mr holmes my hair is somewhat luxuriant and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut it has been considered artistic i could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion  i am afraid that that is quite impossible said i he had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes and i could see a shadow pass over his face as i spoke  i am afraid that it is quite essential said he it is a little fancy of my wifes and ladies fancies you know madam ladies fancies must be consulted and so you wont cut your hair  no sir i really could not i answered firmly  ah very well then that quite settles the matter it is a pity because in other respects you would really have done very nicely in that case miss stoper i had best inspect a few more of your young ladies  the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that i could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal  do you desire your name to be kept upon the books she asked  if you please miss stoper  well really it seems rather useless since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion said she sharply you can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you goodday to you miss hunter she struck a gong upon the table and i was shown out by the page  well mr holmes when i got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard and two or three bills upon the table i began to ask myself whether i had not done a very foolish thing after all if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity very few governesses in england are getting £ 100 a year besides what use was my hair to me many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps i should be among the number next day i was inclined to think that i had made a mistake and by the day after i was sure of it i had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when i received this letter from the gentleman himself i have it here and i will read it to you   the copper beeches near winchester      dear miss huntermiss stoper has very kindly given me your     address and i write from here to ask you whether you have     reconsidered your decision my wife is very anxious that you should     come for she has been much attracted by my description of you we     are willing to give £ 30 a quarter or £ 120 a year so as to     recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may     cause you they are not very exacting after all my wife is fond     of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear     such a dress indoors in the morning you need not however go to     the expense of purchasing one as we have one belonging to my dear     daughter alice now in philadelphia which would i should think     fit you very well then as to sitting here or there or amusing     yourself in any manner indicated that need cause you no     inconvenience as regards your hair it is no doubt a pity     especially as i could not help remarking its beauty during our     short interview but i am afraid that i must remain firm upon this     point and i only hope that the increased salary may recompense you     for the loss your duties as far as the child is concerned are     very light now do try to come and i shall meet you with the     dogcart at winchester let me know your train yours faithfully       jephro rucastle   that is the letter which i have just received mr holmes and my mind is made up that i will accept it i thought however that before taking the final step i should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration  well miss hunter if your mind is made up that settles the question said holmes smiling  but you would not advise me to refuse  i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a sister of mine apply for  what is the meaning of it all mr holmes  ah i have no data i cannot tell perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion  well there seems to me to be only one possible solution mr rucastle seemed to be a very kind goodnatured man is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak  that is a possible solutionin fact as matters stand it is the most probable one but in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady  but the money mr holmes the money  well yes of course the pay is goodtoo good that is what makes me uneasy why should they give you £ 120 a year when they could have their pick for £ 40 there must be some strong reason behind  i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if i wanted your help i should feel so much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me  oh you may carry that feeling away with you i assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months there is something distinctly novel about some of the features if you should find yourself in doubt or in danger  danger what danger do you foresee  holmes shook his head gravely it would cease to be a danger if we could define it said he but at any time day or night a telegram would bring me down to your help  that is enough she rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face i shall go down to hampshire quite easy in my mind now i shall write to mr rucastle at once sacrifice my poor hair tonight and start for winchester tomorrow with a few grateful words to holmes she bade us both goodnight and bustled off upon her way  at least said i as we heard her quick firm steps descending the stairs she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself  and she would need to be said holmes gravely i am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past  it was not very long before my friends prediction was fulfilled a fortnight went by during which i frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange sidealley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into the unusual salary the curious conditions the light duties all pointed to something abnormal though whether a fad or a plot or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain it was quite beyond my powers to determine as to holmes i observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end with knitted brows and an abstracted air but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when i mentioned it data data data he cried impatiently i cant make bricks without clay and yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation  the telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as i was thinking of turning in and holmes was settling down to one of those allnight chemical researches which he frequently indulged in when i would leave him stooping over a retort and a testtube at night and find him in the same position when i came down to breakfast in the morning he opened the yellow envelope and then glancing at the message threw it across to me  just look up the trains in bradshaw said he and turned back to his chemical studies  the summons was a brief and urgent one  please be at the black swan hotel at winchester at midday tomorrow it said do come i am at my wits end   hunter   will you come with me asked holmes glancing up  i should wish to  just look it up then  there is a train at halfpast nine said i glancing over my bradshaw it is due at winchester at 11 30  that will do very nicely then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones as we may need to be at our best in the morning  by eleven oclock the next day we were well upon our way to the old english capital holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down but after we had passed the hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery it was an ideal spring day a light blue sky flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east the sun was shining very brightly and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air which set an edge to a mans energy all over the countryside away to the rolling hills around aldershot the little red and grey roofs of the farmsteadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage  are they not fresh and beautiful i cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of baker street  but holmes shook his head gravely  do you know watson said he that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with reference to my own special subject you look at these scattered houses and you are impressed by their beauty i look at them and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there  good heavens i cried who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads  they always fill me with a certain horror it is my belief watson founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside  you horrify me  but the reason is very obvious the pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of a drunkards blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going and there is but a step between the crime and the dock but look at these lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law think of the deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on year in year out in such places and none the wiser had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester i should never have had a fear for her it is the five miles of country which makes the danger still it is clear that she is not personally threatened  no if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away  quite so she has her freedom  what can be the matter then can you suggest no explanation  i have devised seven separate explanations each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us well there is the tower of the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell  the black swan is an inn of repute in the high street at no distance from the station and there we found the young lady waiting for us she had engaged a sittingroom and our lunch awaited us upon the table  i am so delighted that you have come she said earnestly it is so very kind of you both but indeed i do not know what i should do your advice will be altogether invaluable to me  pray tell us what has happened to you  i will do so and i must be quick for i have promised mr rucastle to be back before three i got his leave to come into town this morning though he little knew for what purpose  let us have everything in its due order holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen  in the first place i may say that i have met on the whole with no actual illtreatment from mr and mrs rucastle it is only fair to them to say that but i cannot understand them and i am not easy in my mind about them  what can you not understand  their reasons for their conduct but you shall have it all just as it occurred when i came down mr rucastle met me here and drove me in his dogcart to the copper beeches it is as he said beautifully situated but it is not beautiful in itself for it is a large square block of a house whitewashed but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather there are grounds round it woods on three sides and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton high road which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door this ground in front belongs to the house but the woods all round are part of lord southertons preserves a clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place  i was driven over by my employer who was as amiable as ever and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child there was no truth mr holmes in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at baker street mrs rucastle is not mad i found her to be a silent palefaced woman much younger than her husband not more than thirty i should think while he can hardly be less than fortyfive from their conversation i have gathered that they have been married about seven years that he was a widower and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia mr rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother as the daughter could not have been less than twenty i can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her fathers young wife  mrs rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse she was a nonentity it was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every little want and forestalling it if possible he was kind to her also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple and yet she had some secret sorrow this woman she would often be lost in deep thought with the saddest look upon her face more than once i have surprised her in tears i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind for i have never met so utterly spoiled and so illnatured a little creature he is small for his age with a head which is quite disproportionately large his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice little birds and insects but i would rather not talk about the creature mr holmes and indeed he has little to do with my story  i am glad of all details remarked my friend whether they seem to you to be relevant or not  i shall try not to miss anything of importance the one unpleasant thing about the house which struck me at once was the appearance and conduct of the servants there are only two a man and his wife toller for that is his name is a rough uncouth man with grizzled hair and whiskers and a perpetual smell of drink twice since i have been with them he has been quite drunk and yet mr rucastle seemed to take no notice of it his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face as silent as mrs rucastle and much less amiable they are a most unpleasant couple but fortunately i spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room which are next to each other in one corner of the building  for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was very quiet on the third mrs rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband  oh yes said he turning to me we are very much obliged to you miss hunter for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair i assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance we shall now see how the electricblue dress will become you you will find it laid out upon the bed in your room and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged  the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue it was of excellent material a sort of beige but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before it could not have been a better fit if i had been measured for it both mr and mrs rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence they were waiting for me in the drawingroom which is a very large room stretching along the entire front of the house with three long windows reaching down to the floor a chair had been placed close to the central window with its back turned towards it in this i was asked to sit and then mr rucastle walking up and down on the other side of the room began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that i have ever listened to you cannot imagine how comical he was and i laughed until i was quite weary mrs rucastle however who has evidently no sense of humour never so much as smiled but sat with her hands in her lap and a sad anxious look upon her face after an hour or so mr rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day and that i might change my dress and go to little edward in the nursery  two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances again i changed my dress again i sat in the window and again i laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense répertoire and which he told inimitably then he handed me a yellowbacked novel and moving my chair a little sideways that my own shadow might not fall upon the page he begged me to read aloud to him i read for about ten minutes beginning in the heart of a chapter and then suddenly in the middle of a sentence he ordered me to cease and to change my dress  you can easily imagine mr holmes how curious i became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be they were always very careful i observed to turn my face away from the window so that i became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back at first it seemed to be impossible but i soon devised a means my handmirror had been broken so a happy thought seized me and i concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief on the next occasion in the midst of my laughter i put my handkerchief up to my eyes and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me i confess that i was disappointed there was nothing at least that was my first impression at the second glance however i perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton road a small bearded man in a grey suit who seemed to be looking in my direction the road is an important highway and there are usually people there this man however was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up i lowered my handkerchief and glanced at mrs rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze she said nothing but i am convinced that she had divined that i had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me she rose at once  jephro said she there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at miss hunter  no friend of yours miss hunter he asked  no i know no one in these parts  dear me how very impertinent kindly turn round and motion to him to go away  surely it would be better to take no notice  no no we should have him loitering here always kindly turn round and wave him away like that  i did as i was told and at the same instant mrs rucastle drew down the blind that was a week ago and from that time i have not sat again in the window nor have i worn the blue dress nor seen the man in the road  pray continue said holmes your narrative promises to be a most interesting one  you will find it rather disconnected i fear and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which i speak on the very first day that i was at the copper beeches mr rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door as we approached it i heard the sharp rattling of a chain and the sound as of a large animal moving about  look in here said mr rucastle showing me a slit between two planks is he not a beauty  i looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness  dont be frightened said my employer laughing at the start which i had given its only carlo my mastiff i call him mine but really old toller my groom is the only man who can do anything with him we feed him once a day and not too much then so that he is always as keen as mustard toller lets him loose every night and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon for goodness sake dont you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night for its as much as your life is worth  the warning was no idle one for two nights later i happened to look out of my bedroom window about two oclock in the morning it was a beautiful moonlight night and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day i was standing rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene when i was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches as it emerged into the moonshine i saw what it was it was a giant dog as large as a calf tawny tinted with hanging jowl black muzzle and huge projecting bones it walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side that dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which i do not think that any burglar could have done  and now i have a very strange experience to tell you i had as you know cut off my hair in london and i had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk one evening after the child was in bed i began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things there was an old chest of drawers in the room the two upper ones empty and open the lower one locked i had filled the first two with my linen and as i had still much to pack away i was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer it struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight so i took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it the very first key fitted to perfection and i drew the drawer open there was only one thing in it but i am sure that you would never guess what it was it was my coil of hair  i took it up and examined it it was of the same peculiar tint and the same thickness but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me how could my hair have been locked in the drawer with trembling hands i undid my trunk turned out the contents and drew from the bottom my own hair i laid the two tresses together and i assure you that they were identical was it not extraordinary puzzle as i would i could make nothing at all of what it meant i returned the strange hair to the drawer and i said nothing of the matter to the rucastles as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked  i am naturally observant as you may have remarked mr holmes and i soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head there was one wing however which appeared not to be inhabited at all a door which faced that which led into the quarters of the tollers opened into this suite but it was invariably locked one day however as i ascended the stair i met mr rucastle coming out through this door his keys in his hand and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round jovial man to whom i was accustomed his cheeks were red his brow was all crinkled with anger and the veins stood out at his temples with passion he locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look  this aroused my curiosity so when i went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge i strolled round to the side from which i could see the windows of this part of the house there were four of them in a row three of which were simply dirty while the fourth was shuttered up they were evidently all deserted as i strolled up and down glancing at them occasionally mr rucastle came out to me looking as merry and jovial as ever  ah said he you must not think me rude if i passed you without a word my dear young lady i was preoccupied with business matters  i assured him that i was not offended by the way said i you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there and one of them has the shutters up  he looked surprised and as it seemed to me a little startled at my remark  photography is one of my hobbies said he i have made my dark room up there but dear me what an observant young lady we have come upon who would have believed it who would have ever believed it he spoke in a jesting tone but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me i read suspicion there and annoyance but no jest  well mr holmes from the moment that i understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which i was not to know i was all on fire to go over them it was not mere curiosity though i have my share of that it was more a feeling of dutya feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place they talk of womans instinct perhaps it was womans instinct which gave me that feeling at any rate it was there and i was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door  it was only yesterday that the chance came i may tell you that besides mr rucastle both toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms and i once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door recently he has been drinking hard and yesterday evening he was very drunk and when i came upstairs there was the key in the door i have no doubt at all that he had left it there mr and mrs rucastle were both downstairs and the child was with them so that i had an admirable opportunity i turned the key gently in the lock opened the door and slipped through  there was a little passage in front of me unpapered and uncarpeted which turned at a right angle at the farther end round this corner were three doors in a line the first and third of which were open they each led into an empty room dusty and cheerless with two windows in the one and one in the other so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them the centre door was closed and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall and fastened at the other with stout cord the door itself was locked as well and the key was not there this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside and yet i could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above as i stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil i suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door a mad unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight mr holmes my overstrung nerves failed me suddenly and i turned and ranran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress i rushed down the passage through the door and straight into the arms of mr rucastle who was waiting outside  so said he smiling it was you then i thought that it must be when i saw the door open  oh i am so frightened i panted  my dear young lady my dear young ladyyou cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner wasand what has frightened you my dear young lady  but his voice was just a little too coaxing he overdid it i was keenly on my guard against him  i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing i answered but it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that i was frightened and ran out again oh it is so dreadfully still in there  only that said he looking at me keenly  why what did you think i asked  why do you think that i lock this door  i am sure that i do not know  it is to keep people out who have no business there do you see he was still smiling in the most amiable manner  i am sure if i had known  well then you know now and if you ever put your foot over that threshold againhere in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage and he glared down at me with the face of a demonill throw you to the mastiff  i was so terrified that i do not know what i did i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over then i thought of you mr holmes i could not live there longer without some advice i was frightened of the house of the man of the woman of the servants even of the child they were all horrible to me if i could only bring you down all would be well of course i might have fled from the house but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears my mind was soon made up i would send you a wire i put on my hat and cloak went down to the office which is about half a mile from the house and then returned feeling very much easier a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature or who would venture to set him free i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this morning but i must be back before three oclock for mr and mrs rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all the evening so that i must look after the child now i have told you all my adventures mr holmes and i should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means and above all what i should do  holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story my friend rose now and paced up and down the room his hands in his pockets and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face  is toller still drunk he asked  yes i heard his wife tell mrs rucastle that she could do nothing with him  that is well and the rucastles go out tonight  yes  is there a cellar with a good strong lock  yes the winecellar  you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl miss hunter do you think that you could perform one more feat i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman  i will try what is it  we shall be at the copper beeches by seven oclock my friend and i the rucastles will be gone by that time and toller will we hope be incapable there only remains mrs toller who might give the alarm if you could send her into the cellar on some errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate matters immensely  i will do it  excellent we shall then look thoroughly into the affair of course there is only one feasible explanation you have been brought there to personate someone and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber that is obvious as to who this prisoner is i have no doubt that it is the daughter miss alice rucastle if i remember right who was said to have gone to america you were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height figure and the colour of your hair hers had been cut off very possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of course yours had to be sacrificed also by a curious chance you came upon her tresses the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of herspossibly her fiancéand no doubt as you wore the girls dress and were so like her he was convinced from your laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture that miss rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer desired his attentions the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her so much is fairly clear the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child  what on earth has that to do with it i ejaculated  my dear watson you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents dont you see that the converse is equally valid i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children this childs disposition is abnormally cruel merely for crueltys sake and whether he derives this from his smiling father as i should suspect or from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power  i am sure that you are right mr holmes cried our client a thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature  we must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning man we can do nothing until seven oclock at that hour we shall be with you and it will not be long before we solve the mystery  we were as good as our word for it was just seven when we reached the copper beeches having put up our trap at a wayside publichouse the group of trees with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun were sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been standing smiling on the doorstep  have you managed it asked holmes  a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs that is mrs toller in the cellar said she her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug here are his keys which are the duplicates of mr rucastles  you have done well indeed cried holmes with enthusiasm now lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black business  we passed up the stair unlocked the door followed on down a passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar then he tried the various keys in the lock but without success no sound came from within and at the silence holmes face clouded over  i trust that we are not too late said he i think miss hunter that we had better go in without you now watson put your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in  it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength together we rushed into the room it was empty there was no furniture save a little pallet bed a small table and a basketful of linen the skylight above was open and the prisoner gone  there has been some villainy here said holmes this beauty has guessed miss hunters intentions and has carried his victim off  but how  through the skylight we shall soon see how he managed it he swung himself up onto the roof ah yes he cried heres the end of a long light ladder against the eaves that is how he did it  but it is impossible said miss hunter the ladder was not there when the rucastles went away  he has come back and done it i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man i should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair i think watson that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready  the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room a very fat and burly man with a heavy stick in his hand miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him  you villain said he wheres your daughter  the fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open skylight  it is for me to ask you that he shrieked you thieves spies and thieves i have caught you have i you are in my power ill serve you he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go  hes gone for the dog cried miss hunter  i have my revolver said i  better close the front door cried holmes and we all rushed down the stairs together we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound and then a scream of agony with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door  my god he cried someone has loosed the dog its not been fed for two days quick quick or itll be too late  holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house with toller hurrying behind us there was the huge famished brute its black muzzle buried in rucastles throat while he writhed and screamed upon the ground running up i blew its brains out and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck with much labour we separated them and carried him living but horribly mangled into the house we laid him upon the drawingroom sofa and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife i did what i could to relieve his pain we were all assembled round him when the door opened and a tall gaunt woman entered the room  mrs toller cried miss hunter  yes miss mr rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you ah miss it is a pity you didnt let me know what you were planning for i would have told you that your pains were wasted  ha said holmes looking keenly at her it is clear that mrs toller knows more about this matter than anyone else  yes sir i do and i am ready enough to tell what i know  then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several points on which i must confess that i am still in the dark  i will soon make it clear to you said she and id have done so before now if i could ha got out from the cellar if theres policecourt business over this youll remember that i was the one that stood your friend and that i was miss alices friend too  she was never happy at home miss alice wasnt from the time that her father married again she was slighted like and had no say in anything but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr fowler at a friends house as well as i could learn miss alice had rights of her own by will but she was so quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them but just left everything in mr rucastles hands he knew he was safe with her but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then her father thought it time to put a stop on it he wanted her to sign a paper so that whether she married or not he could use her money when she wouldnt do it he kept on worrying her until she got brainfever and for six weeks was at deaths door then she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with her beautiful hair cut off but that didnt make no change in her young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be  ah said holmes i think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear and that i can deduce all that remains mr rucastle then i presume took to this system of imprisonment  yes sir  and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of mr fowler  that was it sir  but mr fowler being a persevering man as a good seaman should be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your interests were the same as his  mr fowler was a very kindspoken freehanded gentleman said mrs toller serenely  and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out  you have it sir just as it happened  i am sure we owe you an apology mrs toller said holmes for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us and here comes the country surgeon and mrs rucastle so i think watson that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchester as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one  and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door mr rucastle survived but was always a broken man kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife they still live with their old servants who probably know so much of rucastles past life that he finds it difficult to part from them mr fowler and miss rucastle were married by special license in southampton the day after their flight and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of mauritius as to miss violet hunter my friend holmes rather to my disappointment manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems and she is now the head of a private school at walsall where i believe that she has met with considerable success,the adventures of sherlock holmes,arthur conan doyle                    
mr utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile cold scanty and embarrassed in discourse backward in sentiment lean long dusty dreary and yet somehow lovable at friendly meetings and when the wine was to his taste something eminently human beaconed from his eye something indeed which never found its way into his talk but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the afterdinner face but more often and loudly in the acts of his life he was austere with himself drank gin when he was alone to mortify a taste for vintages and though he enjoyed the theatre had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years but he had an approved tolerance for others sometimes wondering almost with envy at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove i incline to cains heresy he used to say quaintly  i let my brother go to the devil in his own way in this character it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men and to such as these so long as they came about his chambers he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour  no doubt the feat was easy to mr utterson for he was undemonstrative at the best and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of goodnature it is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle readymade from the hands of opportunity and that was the lawyers way his friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest his affections like ivy were the growth of time they implied no aptness in the object hence no doubt the bond that united him to mr richard enfield his distant kinsman the wellknown man about town it was a nut to crack for many what these two could see in each other or what subject they could find in common it was reported by those who encountered them in their sunday walks that they said nothing looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend for all that the two men put the greatest store by these excursions counted them the chief jewel of each week and not only set aside occasions of pleasure but even resisted the calls of business that they might enjoy them uninterrupted  it chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a bystreet in a busy quarter of london the street was small and what is called quiet but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays the inhabitants were all doing well it seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still and laying out the surplus of their gains in coquetry so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation like rows of smiling saleswomen even on sunday when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood like a fire in a forest and with its freshly painted shutters wellpolished brasses and general cleanliness and gaiety of note instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger  two doors from one corner on the left hand going east the line was broken by the entry of a court and just at that point a certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street it was two storeys high showed no window nothing but a door on the lower storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper and bore in every feature the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence the door which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker was blistered and distained tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels children kept shop upon the steps the schoolboy had tried his knife on the mouldings and for close on a generation no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages  mr enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the bystreet but when they came abreast of the entry the former lifted up his cane and pointed  did you ever remark that door he asked and when his companion had replied in the affirmative it is connected in my mind added he with a very odd story  indeed said mr utterson with a slight change of voice and what was that  well it was this way returned mr enfield  i was coming home from some place at the end of the world about three oclock of a black winter morning and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps street after street and all the folks asleepstreet after street all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a churchtill at last i got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman all at once i saw two figures  one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross street well sir the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner and then came the horrible part of the thing for the man trampled calmly over the childs body and left her screaming on the ground it sounds nothing to hear but it was hellish to see it wasnt like a man it was like some damned juggernaut i gave a few halloa took to my heels collared my gentleman and brought him back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child he was perfectly cool and made no resistance but gave me one look so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running the people who had turned out were the girls own family and pretty soon the doctor for whom she had been sent put in his appearance well the child was not much the worse more frightened according to the sawbones and there you might have supposed would be an end to it but there was one curious circumstance i had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight so had the childs family which was only natural but the doctors case was what struck me he was the usual cut and dry apothecary of no particular age and colour with a strong edinburgh accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe well sir he was like the rest of us every time he looked at my prisoner i saw that sawbones turn sick and white with the desire to kill him i knew what was in his mind just as he knew what was in mine and killing being out of the question we did the next best we told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end of london to the other if he had any friends or any credit we undertook that he should lose them and all the time as we were pitching it in red hot we were keeping the women off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies i never saw a circle of such hateful faces and there was the man in the middle with a kind of black sneering coolnessfrightened too i could see thatbut carrying it off sir really like satan if you choose to make capital out of this accident said he i am naturally helpless no gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene says he name your figure well we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the childs family he would have clearly liked to stick out but there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief and at last he struck the next thing was to get the money and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the doorwhipped out a key went in and presently came back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on couttss drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that i cant mention though its one of the points of my story but it was a name at least very well known and often printed the figure was stiff but the signature was good for more than that if it was only genuine i took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal and that a man does not in real life walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another mans cheque for close upon a hundred pounds but he was quite easy and sneering set your mind at rest says he i will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself so we all set off the doctor and the childs father and our friend and myself and passed the rest of the night in my chambers and next day when we had breakfasted went in a body to the bank i gave in the cheque myself and said i had every reason to believe it was a forgery not a bit of it the cheque was genuine  tuttut said mr utterson  i see you feel as i do said mr enfield yes its a bad story for my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with a really damnable man and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the proprieties celebrated too and what makes it worse one of your fellows who do what they call good blackmail i suppose an honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth black mail house is what i call the place with the door in consequence though even that you know is far from explaining all he added and with the words fell into a vein of musing  from this he was recalled by mr utterson asking rather suddenly  and you dont know if the drawer of the cheque lives there  a likely place isnt it returned mr enfield but i happen to have noticed his address he lives in some square or other  and you never asked about theplace with the door said mr utterson  no sir i had a delicacy was the reply i feel very strongly about putting questions it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment you start a question and its like starting a stone you sit quietly on the top of a hill and away the stone goes starting others and presently some bland old bird the last you would have thought of is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to change their name no sir i make it a rule of mine  the more it looks like queer street the less i ask  a very good rule too said the lawyer  but i have studied the place for myself continued mr enfield it seems scarcely a house there is no other door and nobody goes in or out of that one but once in a great while the gentleman of my adventure there are three windows looking on the court on the first floor none below the windows are always shut but theyre clean and then there is a chimney which is generally smoking so somebody must live there and yet its not so sure for the buildings are so packed together about the court that its hard to say where one ends and another begins  the pair walked on again for a while in silence and then enfield said mr utterson thats a good rule of yours  yes i think it is returned enfield  but for all that continued the lawyer theres one point i want to ask i want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child  well said mr enfield i cant see what harm it would do it was a man of the name of hyde  hm said mr utterson what sort of a man is he to see  he is not easy to describe there is something wrong with his appearance something displeasing something downright detestable i never saw a man i so disliked and yet i scarce know why he must be deformed somewhere he gives a strong feeling of deformity although i couldnt specify the point hes an extraordinary looking man and yet i really can name nothing out of the way no sir i can make no hand of it i cant describe him and its not want of memory for i declare i can see him this moment  mr utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration you are sure he used a key he inquired at last  my dear sir began enfield surprised out of himself  yes i know said utterson i know it must seem strange the fact is if i do not ask you the name of the other party it is because i know it already you see richard your tale has gone home if you have been inexact in any point you had better correct it  i think you might have warned me returned the other with a touch of sullenness but i have been pedantically exact as you call it the fellow had a key and whats more he has it still i saw him use it not a week ago  mr utterson sighed deeply but said never a word and the young man presently resumed here is another lesson to say nothing said he i am ashamed of my long tongue let us make a bargain never to refer to this again  with all my heart said the lawyer i shake hands on that richard    search for mr hyde  that evening mr utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish it was his custom of a sunday when this meal was over to sit close by the fire a volume of some dry divinity on his reading desk until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve when he would go soberly and gratefully to bed on this night however as soon as the cloth was taken away he took up a candle and went into his business room there he opened his safe took from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as dr jekylls will and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents the will was holograph for mr utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it it provided not only that in case of the decease of henry jekyll md dcl lld frs etc all his possessions were to pass into the hands of his friend and benefactor edward hyde but that in case of dr jekylls disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months the said edward hyde should step into the said henry jekylls shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the doctors household this document had long been the lawyers eyesore it offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life to whom the fanciful was the immodest and hitherto it was his ignorance of mr hyde that had swelled his indignation now by a sudden turn it was his knowledge it was already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn no more it was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes and out of the shifting insubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye there leaped up the sudden definite presentment of a fiend  i thought it was madness he said as he replaced the obnoxious paper in the safe and now i begin to fear it is disgrace  with that he blew out his candle put on a greatcoat and set forth in the direction of cavendish square that citadel of medicine where his friend the great dr lanyon had his house and received his crowding patients if anyone knows it will be lanyon he had thought  the solemn butler knew and welcomed him he was subjected to no stage of delay but ushered direct from the door to the diningroom where dr lanyon sat alone over his wine this was a hearty healthy dapper redfaced gentleman with a shock of hair prematurely white and a boisterous and decided manner at sight of mr utterson he sprang up from his chair and welcomed him with both hands the geniality as was the way of the man was somewhat theatrical to the eye but it reposed on genuine feeling for these two were old friends old mates both at school and college both thorough respectors of themselves and of each other and what does not always follow men who thoroughly enjoyed each others company  after a little rambling talk the lawyer led up to the subject which so disagreeably preoccupied his mind  i suppose lanyon said he you and i must be the two oldest friends that henry jekyll has  i wish the friends were younger chuckled dr lanyon but i suppose we are and what of that i see little of him now  indeed said utterson i thought you had a bond of common interest  we had was the reply but it is more than ten years since henry jekyll became too fanciful for me he began to go wrong wrong in mind and though of course i continue to take an interest in him for old sakes sake as they say i see and i have seen devilish little of the man such unscientific balderdash added the doctor flushing suddenly purple would have estranged damon and pythias  this little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to mr utterson they have only differed on some point of science he thought and being a man of no scientific passions except in the matter of conveyancing he even added  it is nothing worse than that he gave his friend a few seconds to recover his composure and then approached the question he had come to put did you ever come across a protégé of hisone hyde he asked  hyde repeated lanyon no never heard of him since my time  that was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with him to the great dark bed on which he tossed to and fro until the small hours of the morning began to grow large it was a night of little ease to his toiling mind toiling in mere darkness and besieged by questions  six oclock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently near to mr uttersons dwelling and still he was digging at the problem hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone but now his imagination also was engaged or rather enslaved and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room mr enfields tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures he would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city then of the figure of a man walking swiftly then of a child running from the doctors and then these met and that human juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams or else he would see a room in a rich house where his friend lay asleep dreaming and smiling at his dreams and then the door of that room would be opened the curtains of the bed plucked apart the sleeper recalled and lo there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given and even at that dead hour he must rise and do its bidding the figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night and if at any time he dozed over it was but to see it glide more stealthily through sleeping houses or move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly even to dizziness through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city and at every street corner crush a child and leave her screaming and still the figure had no face by which he might know it even in his dreams it had no face or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes and thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyers mind a singularly strong almost an inordinate curiosity to behold the features of the real mr hyde if he could but once set eyes on him he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined he might see a reason for his friends strange preference or bondage call it which you please and even for the startling clause of the will at least it would be a face worth seeing  the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy  a face which had but to show itself to raise up in the mind of the unimpressionable enfield a spirit of enduring hatred  from that time forward mr utterson began to haunt the door in the bystreet of shops in the morning before office hours at noon when business was plenty and time scarce at night under the face of the fogged city moon by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post  if he be mr hyde he had thought i shall be mr seek  and at last his patience was rewarded it was a fine dry night frost in the air the streets as clean as a ballroom floor the lamps unshaken by any wind drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow by ten oclock when the shops were closed the bystreet was very solitary and in spite of the low growl of london from all round very silent small sounds carried far domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time mr utterson had been some minutes at his post when he was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near in the course of his nightly patrols he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person while he is still a great way off suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city yet his attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested and it was with a strong superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court  the steps drew swiftly nearer and swelled out suddenly louder as they turned the end of the street the lawyer looking forth from the entry could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with he was small and very plainly dressed and the look of him even at that distance went somehow strongly against the watchers inclination but he made straight for the door crossing the roadway to save time and as he came he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home  mr utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed mr hyde i think  mr hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath but his fear was only momentary and though he did not look the lawyer in the face he answered coolly enough  that is my name what do you want  i see you are going in returned the lawyer i am an old friend of dr jekyllsmr utterson of gaunt streetyou must have heard of my name and meeting you so conveniently i thought you might admit me  you will not find dr jekyll he is from home replied mr hyde blowing in the key and then suddenly but still without looking up how did you know me he asked  on your side said mr utterson will you do me a favour  with pleasure replied the other what shall it be  will you let me see your face asked the lawyer  mr hyde appeared to hesitate and then as if upon some sudden reflection fronted about with an air of defiance and the pair stared at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds now i shall know you again said mr utterson it may be useful  yes returned mr hyde it is as well we have met and à propos you should have my address and he gave a number of a street in soho  good god thought mr utterson can he too have been thinking of the will but he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address  and now said the other how did you know me  by description was the reply  whose description  we have common friends said mr utterson  common friends echoed mr hyde a little hoarsely who are they  jekyll for instance said the lawyer  he never told you cried mr hyde with a flush of anger i did not think you would have lied  come said mr utterson that is not fitting language  the other snarled aloud into a savage laugh and the next moment with extraordinary quickness he had unlocked the door and disappeared into the house  the lawyer stood awhile when mr hyde had left him the picture of disquietude then he began slowly to mount the street pausing every step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental perplexity the problem he was thus debating as he walked was one of a class that is rarely solved mr hyde was pale and dwarfish he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation he had a displeasing smile he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness and he spoke with a husky whispering and somewhat broken voice all these were points against him but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust loathing and fear with which mr utterson regarded him there must be something else said the perplexed gentleman there is something more if i could find a name for it god bless me the man seems hardly human something troglodytic shall we say or can it be the old story of dr fell or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul that thus transpires through and transfigures its clay continent the last i think for o my poor old harry jekyll if ever i read satans signature upon a face it is on that of your new friend  round the corner from the bystreet there was a square of ancient handsome houses now for the most part decayed from their high estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men mapengravers architects shady lawyers and the agents of obscure enterprises one house however second from the corner was still occupied entire and at the door of this which wore a great air of wealth and comfort though it was now plunged in darkness except for the fanlight mr utterson stopped and knocked a welldressed elderly servant opened the door  is dr jekyll at home poole asked the lawyer  i will see mr utterson said poole admitting the visitor as he spoke into a large lowroofed comfortable hall paved with flags warmed after the fashion of a country house by a bright open fire and furnished with costly cabinets of oak will you wait here by the fire sir or shall i give you a light in the diningroom  here thank you said the lawyer and he drew near and leaned on the tall fender this hall in which he was now left alone was a pet fancy of his friend the doctors and utterson himself was wont to speak of it as the pleasantest room in london but tonight there was a shudder in his blood the face of hyde sat heavy on his memory he felt what was rare with him a nausea and distaste of life and in the gloom of his spirits he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof he was ashamed of his relief when poole presently returned to announce that dr jekyll was gone out  i saw mr hyde go in by the old dissecting room poole he said is that right when dr jekyll is from home  quite right mr utterson sir replied the servant mr hyde has a key  your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man poole resumed the other musingly  yes sir he does indeed said poole we have all orders to obey him  i do not think i ever met mr hyde asked utterson  o dear no sir he never dines here replied the butler indeed we see very little of him on this side of the house he mostly comes and goes by the laboratory  well goodnight poole  goodnight mr utterson  and the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart poor harry jekyll he thought my mind misgives me he is in deep waters he was wild when he was young a long while ago to be sure but in the law of god there is no statute of limitations ay it must be that the ghost of some old sin the cancer of some concealed disgrace  punishment coming pede claudo years after memory has forgotten and selflove condoned the fault and the lawyer scared by the thought brooded awhile on his own past groping in all the corners of memory lest by chance some jackinthebox of an old iniquity should leap to light there his past was fairly blameless few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided and then by a return on his former subject he conceived a spark of hope this master hyde if he were studied thought he must have secrets of his own black secrets by the look of him secrets compared to which poor jekylls worst would be like sunshine things cannot continue as they are it turns me cold to think of this creature stealing like a thief to harrys bedside poor harry what a wakening and the danger of it for if this hyde suspects the existence of the will he may grow impatient to inherit ay i must put my shoulders to the wheelif jekyll will but let me he added if jekyll will only let me for once more he saw before his minds eye as clear as transparency the strange clauses of the will    dr jekyll was quite at ease  a fortnight later by excellent good fortune the doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies all intelligent reputable men and all judges of good wine and mr utterson so contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed this was no new arrangement but a thing that had befallen many scores of times where utterson was liked he was liked well hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer when the lighthearted and loosetongued had already their foot on the threshold they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company practising for solitude sobering their minds in the mans rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety to this rule dr jekyll was no exception and as he now sat on the opposite side of the firea large wellmade smoothfaced man of fifty with something of a slyish cast perhaps but every mark of capacity and kindnessyou could see by his looks that he cherished for mr utterson a sincere and warm affection  i have been wanting to speak to you jekyll began the latter you know that will of yours  a close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful but the doctor carried it off gaily my poor utterson said he you are unfortunate in such a client i never saw a man so distressed as you were by my will unless it were that hidebound pedant lanyon at what he called my scientific heresies o i know hes a good fellowyou neednt frownan excellent fellow and i always mean to see more of him but a hidebound pedant for all that an ignorant blatant pedant i was never more disappointed in any man than lanyon  you know i never approved of it pursued utterson ruthlessly disregarding the fresh topic  my will yes certainly i know that said the doctor a trifle sharply you have told me so  well i tell you so again continued the lawyer i have been learning something of young hyde  the large handsome face of dr jekyll grew pale to the very lips and there came a blackness about his eyes i do not care to hear more said he this is a matter i thought we had agreed to drop  what i heard was abominable said utterson  it can make no change you do not understand my position returned the doctor with a certain incoherency of manner i am painfully situated utterson my position is a very strangea very strange one it is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking  jekyll said utterson you know me  i am a man to be trusted make a clean breast of this in confidence and i make no doubt i can get you out of it  my good utterson said the doctor this is very good of you this is downright good of you and i cannot find words to thank you in i believe you fully i would trust you before any man alive ay before myself if i could make the choice but indeed it isnt what you fancy it is not as bad as that and just to put your good heart at rest i will tell you one thing  the moment i choose i can be rid of mr hyde i give you my hand upon that and i thank you again and again and i will just add one little word utterson that im sure youll take in good part  this is a private matter and i beg of you to let it sleep  utterson reflected a little looking in the fire  i have no doubt you are perfectly right he said at last getting to his feet  well but since we have touched upon this business and for the last time i hope continued the doctor there is one point i should like you to understand i have really a very great interest in poor hyde i know you have seen him he told me so and i fear he was rude but i do sincerely take a great a very great interest in that young man and if i am taken away utterson i wish you to promise me that you will bear with him and get his rights for him i think you would if you knew all and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise  i cant pretend that i shall ever like him said the lawyer  i dont ask that pleaded jekyll laying his hand upon the others arm i only ask for justice i only ask you to help him for my sake when i am no longer here  utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh well said he i promise    the carew murder case  nearly a year later in the month of october 18 london was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim the details were few and startling a maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river had gone upstairs to bed about eleven although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours the early part of the night was cloudless and the lane which the maids window overlooked was brilliantly lit by the full moon it seems she was romantically given for she sat down upon her box which stood immediately under the window and fell into a dream of musing never she used to say with streaming tears when she narrated that experience never had she felt more at peace with all men or thought more kindly of the world and as she so sat she became aware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair drawing near along the lane and advancing to meet him another and very small gentleman to whom at first she paid less attention when they had come within speech which was just under the maids eyes the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness it did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great importance indeed from his pointing it sometimes appeared as if he were only inquiring his way but the moon shone on his face as he spoke and the girl was pleased to watch it it seemed to breathe such an innocent and oldworld kindness of disposition yet with something high too as of a wellfounded selfcontent presently her eye wandered to the other and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain mr hyde who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a dislike he had in his hand a heavy cane with which he was trifling but he answered never a word and seemed to listen with an illcontained impatience and then all of a sudden he broke out in a great flame of anger stamping with his foot brandishing the cane and carrying on as the maid described it like a madman the old gentleman took a step back with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt and at that mr hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to the earth and next moment with apelike fury he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway at the horror of these sights and sounds the maid fainted  it was two oclock when she came to herself and called for the police the murderer was gone long ago but there lay his victim in the middle of the lane incredibly mangled the stick with which the deed had been done although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutterthe other without doubt had been carried away by the murderer a purse and gold watch were found upon the victim  but no cards or papers except a sealed and stamped envelope which he had been probably carrying to the post and which bore the name and address of mr utterson  this was brought to the lawyer the next morning before he was out of bed and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances than he shot out a solemn lip i shall say nothing till i have seen the body said he this may be very serious have the kindness to wait while i dress and with the same grave countenance he hurried through his breakfast and drove to the police station whither the body had been carried as soon as he came into the cell he nodded  yes said he i recognise him i am sorry to say that this is sir danvers carew  good god sir exclaimed the officer is it possible and the next moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition this will make a deal of noise he said and perhaps you can help us to the man and he briefly narrated what the maid had seen and showed the broken stick  mr utterson had already quailed at the name of hyde but when the stick was laid before him he could doubt no longer broken and battered as it was he recognised it for one that he had himself presented many years before to henry jekyll  is this mr hyde a person of small stature he inquired  particularly small and particularly wickedlooking is what the maid calls him said the officer  mr utterson reflected and then raising his head if you will come with me in my cab he said i think i can take you to his house  it was by this time about nine in the morning and the first fog of the season a great chocolatecoloured pall lowered over heaven but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours so that as the cab crawled from street to street mr utterson beheld a marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight for here it would be dark like the backend of evening and there would be a glow of a rich lurid brown like the light of some strange conflagration and here for a moment the fog would be quite broken up and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths the dismal quarter of soho seen under these changing glimpses with its muddy ways and slatternly passengers and its lamps which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful reinvasion of darkness seemed in the lawyers eyes like a district of some city in a nightmare the thoughts of his mind besides were of the gloomiest dye and when he glanced at the companion of his drive he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the laws officers which may at times assail the most honest  as the cab drew up before the address indicated the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street a gin palace a low french eating house a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads many ragged children huddled in the doorways and many women of many different nationalities passing out key in hand to have a morning glass and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part as brown as umber and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings this was the home of henry jekylls favourite of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling  an ivoryfaced and silveryhaired old woman opened the door she had an evil face smoothed by hypocrisy  but her manners were excellent yes she said this was mr hydes but he was not at home he had been in that night very late but he had gone away again in less than an hour there was nothing strange in that his habits were very irregular and he was often absent for instance it was nearly two months since she had seen him till yesterday  very well then we wish to see his rooms said the lawyer and when the woman began to declare it was impossible i had better tell you who this person is he added this is inspector newcomen of scotland yard  a flash of odious joy appeared upon the womans face ah said she he is in trouble what has he done  mr utterson and the inspector exchanged glances he dont seem a very popular character observed the latter and now my good woman just let me and this gentleman have a look about us  in the whole extent of the house which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty mr hyde had only used a couple of rooms but these were furnished with luxury and good taste a closet was filled with wine the plate was of silver the napery elegant a good picture hung upon the walls a gift as utterson supposed from henry jekyll who was much of a connoisseur and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable in colour at this moment however the rooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked clothes lay about the floor with their pockets inside out lockfast drawers stood open and on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes as though many papers had been burned from these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end of a green cheque book which had resisted the action of the fire the other half of the stick was found behind the door and as this clinched his suspicions the officer declared himself delighted a visit to the bank where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderers credit completed his gratification  you may depend upon it sir he told mr utterson  i have him in my hand he must have lost his head or he never would have left the stick or above all burned the cheque book why moneys life to the man we have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank and get out the handbills  this last however was not so easy of accomplishment for mr hyde had numbered few familiarseven the master of the servant maid had only seen him twice his family could nowhere be traced he had never been photographed and the few who could describe him differed widely as common observers will only on one point were they agreed and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive impressed his beholders    incident of the letter  it was late in the afternoon when mr utterson found his way to dr jekylls door where he was at once admitted by poole and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or dissecting rooms the doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon and his own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden it was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of his friends quarters and he eyed the dingy windowless structure with curiosity and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as he crossed the theatre once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent the tables laden with chemical apparatus the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola at the further end a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize and through this mr utterson was at last received into the doctors cabinet it was a large room fitted round with glass presses furnished among other things with a chevalglass and a business table and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron the fire burned in the grate a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly and there close up to the warmth sat dr jekyll looking deathly sick he did not rise to meet his visitor but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice  and now said mr utterson as soon as poole had left them you have heard the news  the doctor shuddered they were crying it in the square he said i heard them in my diningroom  one word said the lawyer carew was my client but so are you and i want to know what i am doing you have not been mad enough to hide this fellow  utterson i swear to god cried the doctor i swear to god i will never set eyes on him again i bind my honour to you that i am done with him in this world it is all at an end and indeed he does not want my help you do not know him as i do he is safe he is quite safe mark my words he will never more be heard of  the lawyer listened gloomily he did not like his friends feverish manner you seem pretty sure of him said he and for your sake i hope you may be right if it came to a trial your name might appear  i am quite sure of him replied jekyll i have grounds for certainty that i cannot share with any one but there is one thing on which you may advise me i havei have received a letter and i am at a loss whether i should show it to the police i should like to leave it in your hands utterson you would judge wisely i am sure i have so great a trust in you  you fear i suppose that it might lead to his detection asked the lawyer  no said the other i cannot say that i care what becomes of hyde i am quite done with him i was thinking of my own character which this hateful business has rather exposed  utterson ruminated awhile he was surprised at his friends selfishness and yet relieved by it well said he at last let me see the letter  the letter was written in an odd upright hand and signed edward hyde  and it signified briefly enough that the writers benefactor dr jekyll whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand generosities need labour under no alarm for his safety as he had means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence the lawyer liked this letter well enough it put a better colour on the intimacy than he had looked for and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions  have you the envelope he asked  i burned it replied jekyll before i thought what i was about but it bore no postmark the note was handed in  shall i keep this and sleep upon it asked utterson  i wish you to judge for me entirely was the reply i have lost confidence in myself  well i shall consider returned the lawyer and now one word more  it was hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that disappearance  the doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness he shut his mouth tight and nodded  i knew it said utterson he meant to murder you you had a fine escape  i have had what is far more to the purpose returned the doctor solemnly  i have had a lessono god utterson what a lesson i have had and he covered his face for a moment with his hands  on his way out the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with poole by the bye said he there was a letter handed in today  what was the messenger like but poole was positive nothing had come except by post and only circulars by that he added  this news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door possibly indeed it had been written in the cabinet and if that were so it must be differently judged and handled with the more caution the newsboys as he went were crying themselves hoarse along the footways  special edition shocking murder of an mp that was the funeral oration of one friend and client and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal it was at least a ticklish decision that he had to make and selfreliant as he was by habit he began to cherish a longing for advice it was not to be had directly but perhaps he thought it might be fished for  presently after he sat on one side of his own hearth with mr guest his head clerk upon the other and midway between at a nicely calculated distance from the fire a bottle of a particular old wine that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house the fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city where the lamps glimmered like carbuncles and through the muffle and smother of these fallen clouds the procession of the towns life was still rolling in through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind but the room was gay with firelight in the bottle the acids were long ago resolved the imperial dye had softened with time as the colour grows richer in stained windows and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs of london insensibly the lawyer melted there was no man from whom he kept fewer secrets than mr guest and he was not always sure that he kept as many as he meant guest had often been on business to the doctors he knew poole he could scarce have failed to hear of mr hydes familiarity about the house he might draw conclusions  was it not as well then that he should see a letter which put that mystery to right and above all since guest being a great student and critic of handwriting would consider the step natural and obliging the clerk besides was a man of counsel he could scarce read so strange a document without dropping a remark and by that remark mr utterson might shape his future course  this is a sad business about sir danvers he said  yes sir indeed it has elicited a great deal of public feeling returned guest the man of course was mad  i should like to hear your views on that replied utterson i have a document here in his handwriting it is between ourselves for i scarce know what to do about it it is an ugly business at the best but there it is quite in your way  a murderers autograph  guests eyes brightened and he sat down at once and studied it with passion no sir he said  not mad but it is an odd hand  and by all accounts a very odd writer added the lawyer  just then the servant entered with a note  is that from dr jekyll sir inquired the clerk i thought i knew the writing anything private mr utterson  only an invitation to dinner why do you want to see it  one moment i thank you sir and the clerk laid the two sheets of paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents thank you sir he said at last returning both its a very interesting autograph  there was a pause during which mr utterson struggled with himself why did you compare them guest he inquired suddenly  well sir returned the clerk theres a rather singular resemblance the two hands are in many points identical  only differently sloped  rather quaint said utterson  it is as you say rather quaint returned guest  i wouldnt speak of this note you know said the master  no sir said the clerk i understand  but no sooner was mr utterson alone that night than he locked the note into his safe where it reposed from that time forward what he thought henry jekyll forge for a murderer and his blood ran cold in his veins    incident of dr lanyon  time ran on thousands of pounds were offered in reward for the death of sir danvers was resented as a public injury but mr hyde had disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never existed much of his past was unearthed indeed and all disreputable  tales came out of the mans cruelty at once so callous and violent of his vile life of his strange associates of the hatred that seemed to have surrounded his career but of his present whereabouts not a whisper from the time he had left the house in soho on the morning of the murder he was simply blotted out and gradually as time drew on mr utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm and to grow more at quiet with himself the death of sir danvers was to his way of thinking more than paid for by the disappearance of mr hyde now that that evil influence had been withdrawn a new life began for dr jekyll he came out of his seclusion renewed relations with his friends became once more their familiar guest and entertainer and whilst he had always been known for charities he was now no less distinguished for religion he was busy he was much in the open air he did good his face seemed to open and brighten as if with an inward consciousness of service and for more than two months the doctor was at peace  on the 8th of january utterson had dined at the doctors with a small party lanyon had been there and the face of the host had looked from one to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable friends on the 12th and again on the 14th the door was shut against the lawyer the doctor was confined to the house poole said and saw no one on the 15th he tried again and was again refused and having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost daily he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits the fifth night he had in guest to dine with him and the sixth he betook himself to dr lanyons  there at least he was not denied admittance but when he came in he was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctors appearance he had his deathwarrant written legibly upon his face the rosy man had grown pale his flesh had fallen away he was visibly balder and older and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift physical decay that arrested the lawyers notice as a look in the eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deepseated terror of the mind it was unlikely that the doctor should fear death and yet that was what utterson was tempted to suspect yes he thought he is a doctor he must know his own state and that his days are counted and the knowledge is more than he can bear and yet when utterson remarked on his ill looks it was with an air of great firmness that lanyon declared himself a doomed man  i have had a shock he said and i shall never recover it is a question of weeks well life has been pleasant i liked it yes sir i used to like it i sometimes think if we knew all we should be more glad to get away  jekyll is ill too observed utterson have you seen him  but lanyons face changed and he held up a trembling hand i wish to see or hear no more of dr jekyll he said in a loud unsteady voice i am quite done with that person and i beg that you will spare me any allusion to one whom i regard as dead  tut tut said mr utterson and then after a considerable pause cant i do anything he inquired we are three very old friends lanyon we shall not live to make others  nothing can be done returned lanyon ask himself  he will not see me said the lawyer  i am not surprised at that was the reply some day utterson after i am dead you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this i cannot tell you and in the meantime if you can sit and talk with me of other things for gods sake stay and do so but if you cannot keep clear of this accursed topic then in gods name go for i cannot bear it  as soon as he got home utterson sat down and wrote to jekyll complaining of his exclusion from the house and asking the cause of this unhappy break with lanyon and the next day brought him a long answer often very pathetically worded and sometimes darkly mysterious in drift the quarrel with lanyon was incurable i do not blame our old friend jekyll wrote but i share his view that we must never meet i mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion you must not be surprised nor must you doubt my friendship if my door is often shut even to you you must suffer me to go my own dark way i have brought on myself a punishment and a danger that i cannot name if i am the chief of sinners i am the chief of sufferers also i could not think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so unmanning and you can do but one thing utterson to lighten this destiny and that is to respect my silence utterson was amazed the dark influence of hyde had been withdrawn the doctor had returned to his old tasks and amities a week ago the prospect had smiled with every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age and now in a moment friendship and peace of mind and the whole tenor of his life were wrecked so great and unprepared a change pointed to madness but in view of lanyons manner and words there must lie for it some deeper ground  a week afterwards dr lanyon took to his bed and in something less than a fortnight he was dead the night after the funeral at which he had been sadly affected utterson locked the door of his business room and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle drew out and set before him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal of his dead friend private  for the hands of g j utterson alone and in case of his predecease to be destroyed unread so it was emphatically superscribed and the lawyer dreaded to behold the contents i have buried one friend today he thought  what if this should cost me another and then he condemned the fear as a disloyalty and broke the seal within there was another enclosure likewise sealed and marked upon the cover as not to be opened till the death or disappearance of dr henry jekyll utterson could not trust his eyes yes it was disappearance here again as in the mad will which he had long ago restored to its author here again were the idea of a disappearance and the name of henry jekyll bracketted but in the will that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man hyde it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible written by the hand of lanyon what should it mean a great curiosity came on the trustee to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries but professional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent obligations and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his private safe  it is one thing to mortify curiosity another to conquer it and it may be doubted if from that day forth utterson desired the society of his surviving friend with the same eagerness he thought of him kindly but his thoughts were disquieted and fearful he went to call indeed but he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance perhaps in his heart he preferred to speak with poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air and sounds of the open city rather than to be admitted into that house of voluntary bondage and to sit and speak with its inscrutable recluse poole had indeed no very pleasant news to communicate the doctor it appeared now more than ever confined himself to the cabinet over the laboratory where he would sometimes even sleep he was out of spirits he had grown very silent he did not read it seemed as if he had something on his mind utterson became so used to the unvarying character of these reports that he fell off little by little in the frequency of his visits    incident at the window  it chanced on sunday when mr utterson was on his usual walk with mr enfield that their way lay once again through the bystreet and that when they came in front of the door both stopped to gaze on it  well said enfield that storys at an end at least we shall never see more of mr hyde  i hope not said utterson did i ever tell you that i once saw him and shared your feeling of repulsion  it was impossible to do the one without the other returned enfield and by the way what an ass you must have thought me not to know that this was a back way to dr jekylls it was partly your own fault that i found it out even when i did  so you found it out did you said utterson but if that be so we may step into the court and take a look at the windows to tell you the truth i am uneasy about poor jekyll and even outside i feel as if the presence of a friend might do him good  the court was very cool and a little damp and full of premature twilight although the sky high up overhead was still bright with sunset the middle one of the three windows was halfway open and sitting close beside it taking the air with an infinite sadness of mien like some disconsolate prisoner utterson saw dr jekyll  what jekyll he cried i trust you are better  i am very low utterson replied the doctor drearily very low it will not last long thank god  you stay too much indoors said the lawyer you should be out whipping up the circulation like mr enfield and me this is my cousinmr enfielddr jekyll come now get your hat and take a quick turn with us  you are very good sighed the other i should like to very much but no no no it is quite impossible i dare not but indeed utterson i am very glad to see you this is really a great pleasure i would ask you and mr enfield up but the place is really not fit  why then said the lawyer goodnaturedly the best thing we can do is to stay down here and speak with you from where we are  that is just what i was about to venture to propose returned the doctor with a smile but the words were hardly uttered before the smile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such abject terror and despair as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen below they saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly thrust down but that glimpse had been sufficient and they turned and left the court without a word in silence too they traversed the bystreet and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring thoroughfare where even upon a sunday there were still some stirrings of life that mr utterson at last turned and looked at his companion they were both pale and there was an answering horror in their eyes  god forgive us god forgive us said mr utterson  but mr enfield only nodded his head very seriously and walked on once more in silence    the last night  mr utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner when he was surprised to receive a visit from poole  bless me poole what brings you here he cried and then taking a second look at him what ails you he added is the doctor ill  mr utterson said the man there is something wrong  take a seat and here is a glass of wine for you said the lawyer now take your time and tell me plainly what you want  you know the doctors ways sir replied poole and how he shuts himself up well hes shut up again in the cabinet and i dont like it siri wish i may die if i like it mr utterson sir im afraid  now my good man said the lawyer be explicit what are you afraid of  ive been afraid for about a week returned poole doggedly disregarding the question and i can bear it no more  the mans appearance amply bore out his words his manner was altered for the worse and except for the moment when he had first announced his terror he had not once looked the lawyer in the face even now he sat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee and his eyes directed to a corner of the floor i can bear it no more he repeated  come said the lawyer i see you have some good reason poole i see there is something seriously amiss try to tell me what it is  i think theres been foul play said poole hoarsely  foul play cried the lawyer a good deal frightened and rather inclined to be irritated in consequence what foul play what does the man mean  i darent say sir was the answer but will you come along with me and see for yourself  mr uttersons only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat but he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared upon the butlers face and perhaps with no less that the wine was still untasted when he set it down to follow  it was a wild cold seasonable night of march with a pale moon lying on her back as though the wind had tilted her and flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture the wind made talking difficult and flecked the blood into the face it seemed to have swept the streets unusually bare of passengers besides for mr utterson thought he had never seen that part of london so deserted he could have wished it otherwise never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his fellowcreatures for struggle as he might there was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity the square when they got there was full of wind and dust and the thin trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing poole who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead now pulled up in the middle of the pavement and in spite of the biting weather took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red pockethandkerchief but for all the hurry of his coming these were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away but the moisture of some strangling anguish for his face was white and his voice when he spoke harsh and broken  well sir he said here we are and god grant there be nothing wrong  amen poole said the lawyer  thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner the door was opened on the chain and a voice asked from within is that you poole  its all right said poole open the door  the hall when they entered it was brightly lighted up the fire was built high and about the hearth the whole of the servants men and women stood huddled together like a flock of sheep at the sight of mr utterson the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering and the cook crying out bless god its mr utterson ran forward as if to take him in her arms  what what are you all here said the lawyer peevishly very irregular very unseemly your master would be far from pleased  theyre all afraid said poole  blank silence followed no one protesting only the maid lifted her voice and now wept loudly  hold your tongue poole said to her with a ferocity of accent that testified to his own jangled nerves and indeed when the girl had so suddenly raised the note of her lamentation they had all started and turned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation and now continued the butler addressing the knifeboy reach me a candle and well get this through hands at once and then he begged mr utterson to follow him and led the way to the back garden  now sir said he you come as gently as you can i want you to hear and i dont want you to be heard and see here sir if by any chance he was to ask you in dont go  mr uttersons nerves at this unlookedfor termination gave a jerk that nearly threw him from his balance but he recollected his courage and followed the butler into the laboratory building through the surgical theatre with its lumber of crates and bottles to the foot of the stair here poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen while he himself setting down the candle and making a great and obvious call on his resolution mounted the steps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door  mr utterson sir asking to see you he called and even as he did so once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear  a voice answered from within  tell him i cannot see anyone it said complainingly  thank you sir said poole with a note of something like triumph in his voice and taking up his candle he led mr utterson back across the yard and into the great kitchen where the fire was out and the beetles were leaping on the floor  sir he said looking mr utterson in the eyes was that my masters voice  it seems much changed replied the lawyer very pale but giving look for look  changed well yes i think so said the butler have i been twenty years in this mans house to be deceived about his voice no sir masters made away with he was made away with eight days ago when we heard him cry out upon the name of god and whos in there instead of him and why it stays there is a thing that cries to heaven mr utterson  this is a very strange tale poole this is rather a wild tale my man said mr utterson biting his finger suppose it were as you suppose supposing dr jekyll to have beenwell murdered what could induce the murderer to stay that wont hold water it doesnt commend itself to reason  well mr utterson you are a hard man to satisfy but ill do it yet said poole all this last week you must know him or it whatever it is that lives in that cabinet has been crying night and day for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind it was sometimes his waythe masters that isto write his orders on a sheet of paper and throw it on the stair weve had nothing else this week back nothing but papers and a closed door and the very meals left there to be smuggled in when nobody was looking well sir every day ay and twice and thrice in the same day there have been orders and complaints and i have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists in town every time i brought the stuff back there would be another paper telling me to return it because it was not pure and another order to a different firm this drug is wanted bitter bad sir whatever for  have you any of these papers asked mr utterson  poole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note which the lawyer bending nearer to the candle carefully examined its contents ran thus  dr jekyll presents his compliments to messrs maw he assures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his present purpose in the year 18 dr j purchased a somewhat large quantity from messrs m he now begs them to search with most sedulous care and should any of the same quality be left forward it to him at once expense is no consideration the importance of this to dr j can hardly be exaggerated so far the letter had run composedly enough but here with a sudden splutter of the pen the writers emotion had broken loose for gods sake he added find me some of the old  this is a strange note said mr utterson and then sharply how do you come to have it open  the man at maws was main angry sir and he threw it back to me like so much dirt returned poole  this is unquestionably the doctors hand do you know resumed the lawyer  i thought it looked like it said the servant rather sulkily and then with another voice but what matters hand of write he said ive seen him  seen him repeated mr utterson well  thats it said poole it was this way i came suddenly into the theatre from the garden it seems he had slipped out to look for this drug or whatever it is for the cabinet door was open and there he was at the far end of the room digging among the crates he looked up when i came in gave a kind of cry and whipped upstairs into the cabinet it was but for one minute that i saw him but the hair stood upon my head like quills sir if that was my master why had he a mask upon his face if it was my master why did he cry out like a rat and run from me i have served him long enough and then the man paused and passed his hand over his face  these are all very strange circumstances said mr utterson but i think i begin to see daylight your master poole is plainly seized with one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer hence for aught i know the alteration of his voice hence the mask and the avoidance of his friends hence his eagerness to find this drug by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate recoverygod grant that he be not deceived there is my explanation it is sad enough poole ay and appalling to consider but it is plain and natural hangs well together and delivers us from all exorbitant alarms  sir said the butler turning to a sort of mottled pallor that thing was not my master and theres the truth my masterhere he looked round him and began to whisperis a tall fine build of a man and this was more of a dwarf utterson attempted to protest o sir cried poole do you think i do not know my master after twenty years do you think i do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door where i saw him every morning of my life no sir that thing in the mask was never dr jekyllgod knows what it was but it was never dr jekyll and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done  poole replied the lawyer if you say that it will become my duty to make certain much as i desire to spare your masters feelings much as i am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still alive i shall consider it my duty to break in that door  ah mr utterson thats talking cried the butler  and now comes the second question resumed utterson  who is going to do it  why you and me sir was the undaunted reply  thats very well said returned the lawyer and whatever comes of it i shall make it my business to see you are no loser  there is an axe in the theatre continued poole and you might take the kitchen poker for yourself  the lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand and balanced it do you know poole he said looking up that you and i are about to place ourselves in a position of some peril  you may say so sir indeed returned the butler  it is well then that we should be frank said the other we both think more than we have said let us make a clean breast this masked figure that you saw did you recognise it  well sir it went so quick and the creature was so doubled up that i could hardly swear to that was the answer but if you mean was it mr hydewhy yes i think it was you see it was much of the same bigness and it had the same quick light way with it and then who else could have got in by the laboratory door you have not forgot sir that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him but thats not all i dont know mr utterson if you ever met this mr hyde  yes said the lawyer i once spoke with him  then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something queer about that gentlemansomething that gave a man a turni dont know rightly how to say it sir beyond this  that you felt in your marrow kind of cold and thin  i own i felt something of what you describe said mr utterson  quite so sir returned poole well when that masked thing like a monkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet it went down my spine like ice o i know its not evidence mr utterson im booklearned enough for that but a man has his feelings and i give you my bibleword it was mr hyde  ay ay said the lawyer my fears incline to the same point evil i fear foundedevil was sure to comeof that connection ay truly i believe you i believe poor harry is killed and i believe his murderer for what purpose god alone can tell is still lurking in his victims room well let our name be vengeance call bradshaw  the footman came at the summons very white and nervous  pull yourself together bradshaw said the lawyer this suspense i know is telling upon all of you but it is now our intention to make an end of it poole here and i are going to force our way into the cabinet if all is well my shoulders are broad enough to bear the blame meanwhile lest anything should really be amiss or any malefactor seek to escape by the back you and the boy must go round the corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the laboratory door we give you ten minutes to get to your stations  as bradshaw left the lawyer looked at his watch and now poole let us get to ours he said and taking the poker under his arm led the way into the yard the scud had banked over the moon and it was now quite dark the wind which only broke in puffs and draughts into that deep well of building tossed the light of the candle to and fro about their steps until they came into the shelter of the theatre where they sat down silently to wait london hummed solemnly all around but nearer at hand the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a footfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor  so it will walk all day sir whispered poole ay and the better part of the night only when a new sample comes from the chemist theres a bit of a break ah its an ill conscience thats such an enemy to rest ah sir theres blood foully shed in every step of it but hark again a little closerput your heart in your ears mr utterson and tell me is that the doctors foot  the steps fell lightly and oddly with a certain swing for all they went so slowly it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread of henry jekyll utterson sighed is there never anything else he asked  poole nodded once he said once i heard it weeping  weeping how that said the lawyer conscious of a sudden chill of horror  weeping like a woman or a lost soul said the butler i came away with that upon my heart that i could have wept too  but now the ten minutes drew to an end poole disinterred the axe from under a stack of packing straw the candle was set upon the nearest table to light them to the attack and they drew near with bated breath to where that patient foot was still going up and down up and down in the quiet of the night  jekyll cried utterson with a loud voice i demand to see you he paused a moment but there came no reply i give you fair warning our suspicions are aroused and i must and shall see you he resumed if not by fair means then by foulif not of your consent then by brute force  utterson said the voice for gods sake have mercy  ah thats not jekylls voiceits hydes cried utterson down with the door poole  poole swung the axe over his shoulder the blow shook the building and the red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges a dismal screech as of mere animal terror rang from the cabinet up went the axe again and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded four times the blow fell but the wood was tough and the fittings were of excellent workmanship and it was not until the fifth that the lock burst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet  the besiegers appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had succeeded stood back a little and peered in there lay the cabinet before their eyes in the quiet lamplight a good fire glowing and chattering on the hearth the kettle singing its thin strain a drawer or two open papers neatly set forth on the business table and nearer the fire the things laid out for tea the quietest room you would have said and but for the glazed presses full of chemicals the most commonplace that night in london  right in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and still twitching they drew near on tiptoe turned it on its back and beheld the face of edward hyde he was dressed in clothes far too large for him clothes of the doctors bigness the cords of his face still moved with a semblance of life but life was quite gone and by the crushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung upon the air utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a selfdestroyer  we have come too late he said sternly whether to save or punish hyde is gone to his account and it only remains for us to find the body of your master  the far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre which filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above and by the cabinet which formed an upper storey at one end and looked upon the court a corridor joined the theatre to the door on the bystreet and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second flight of stairs there were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar all these they now thoroughly examined each closet needed but a glance for all were empty and all by the dust that fell from their doors had stood long unopened the cellar indeed was filled with crazy lumber mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was jekylls predecessor but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance nowhere was there any trace of henry jekyll dead or alive  poole stamped on the flags of the corridor he must be buried here he said hearkening to the sound  or he may have fled said utterson and he turned to examine the door in the bystreet it was locked and lying near by on the flags they found the key already stained with rust  this does not look like use observed the lawyer  use echoed poole do you not see sir it is broken much as if a man had stamped on it  ay continued utterson and the fractures too are rusty the two men looked at each other with a scare this is beyond me poole said the lawyer let us go back to the cabinet  they mounted the stair in silence and still with an occasional awestruck glance at the dead body proceeded more thoroughly to examine the contents of the cabinet at one table there were traces of chemical work various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass saucers as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been prevented  that is the same drug that i was always bringing him said poole and even as he spoke the kettle with a startling noise boiled over  this brought them to the fireside where the easychair was drawn cosily up and the tea things stood ready to the sitters elbow the very sugar in the cup there were several books on a shelf one lay beside the tea things open and utterson was amazed to find it a copy of a pious work for which jekyll had several times expressed a great esteem annotated in his own hand with startling blasphemies  next in the course of their review of the chamber the searchers came to the chevalglass into whose depths they looked with an involuntary horror but it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow playing on the roof the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses and their own pale and fearful countenances stooping to look in  this glass has seen some strange things sir whispered poole  and surely none stranger than itself echoed the lawyer in the same tones for what did jekyllhe caught himself up at the word with a start and then conquering the weaknesswhat could jekyll want with it he said  you may say that said poole  next they turned to the business table on the desk among the neat array of papers a large envelope was uppermost and bore in the doctors hand the name of mr utterson the lawyer unsealed it and several enclosures fell to the floor the first was a will drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of disappearance but in place of the name of edward hyde the lawyer with indescribable amazement read the name of gabriel john utterson he looked at poole and then back at the paper and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet  my head goes round he said he has been all these days in possession he had no cause to like me he must have raged to see himself displaced and he has not destroyed this document  he caught up the next paper it was a brief note in the doctors hand and dated at the top o poole the lawyer cried he was alive and here this day he cannot have been disposed of in so short a space he must be still alive he must have fled and then why fled and how and in that case can we venture to declare this suicide o we must be careful i foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire catastrophe  why dont you read it sir asked poole  because i fear replied the lawyer solemnly god grant i have no cause for it and with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read as follows    my dear uttersonwhen this shall fall into your hands i shall have disappeared under what circumstances i have not the penetration to foresee but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless situation tell me that the end is sure and must be early go then and first read the narrative which lanyon warned me he was to place in your hands and if you care to hear more turn to the confession of  your unworthy and unhappy friend  henry jekyll   there was a third enclosure asked utterson  here sir said poole and gave into his hands a considerable packet sealed in several places  the lawyer put it in his pocket i would say nothing of this paper if your master has fled or is dead we may at least save his credit it is now ten i must go home and read these documents in quiet but i shall be back before midnight when we shall send for the police  they went out locking the door of the theatre behind them and utterson once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the hall trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which this mystery was now to be explained    dr lanyons narrative  on the ninth of january now four days ago i received by the evening delivery a registered envelope addressed in the hand of my colleague and old school companion henry jekyll i was a good deal surprised by this for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence i had seen the man dined with him indeed the night before and i could imagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of registration the contents increased my wonder for this is how the letter ran   10th december 18   dear lanyonyou are one of my oldest friends and although we may have differed at times on scientific questions i cannot remember at least on my side any break in our affection there was never a day when if you had said to me jekyll my life my honour my reason depend upon you i would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you lanyon my life my honour my reason are all at your mercy if you fail me tonight i am lost you might suppose after this preface that i am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant judge for yourself  i want you to postpone all other engagements for tonightay even if you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor to take a cab unless your carriage should be actually at the door and with this letter in your hand for consultation to drive straight to my house poole my butler has his orders you will find him waiting your arrival with a locksmith the door of my cabinet is then to be forced and you are to go in alone to open the glazed press letter e on the left hand breaking the lock if it be shut and to draw out with all its contents as they stand the fourth drawer from the top or which is the same thing the third from the bottom in my extreme distress of mind i have a morbid fear of misdirecting you but even if i am in error you may know the right drawer by its contents  some powders a phial and a paper book this drawer i beg of you to carry back with you to cavendish square exactly as it stands  that is the first part of the service  now for the second you should be back if you set out at once on the receipt of this long before midnight but i will leave you that amount of margin not only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor foreseen but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be preferred for what will then remain to do at midnight then i have to ask you to be alone in your consulting room to admit with your own hand into the house a man who will present himself in my name and to place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from my cabinet then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude completely five minutes afterwards if you insist upon an explanation you will have understood that these arrangements are of capital importance and that by the neglect of one of them fantastic as they must appear you might have charged your conscience with my death or the shipwreck of my reason  confident as i am that you will not trifle with this appeal my heart sinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility think of me at this hour in a strange place labouring under a blackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate and yet well aware that if you will but punctually serve me my troubles will roll away like a story that is told serve me my dear lanyon and save  your friend   hj   psi had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my soul it is possible that the postoffice may fail me and this letter not come into your hands until tomorrow morning in that case dear lanyon do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the course of the day and once more expect my messenger at midnight it may then already be too late and if that night passes without event you will know that you have seen the last of henry jekyll   upon the reading of this letter i made sure my colleague was insane but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt i felt bound to do as he requested the less i understood of this farrago the less i was in a position to judge of its importance and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility i rose accordingly from table got into a hansom and drove straight to jekylls house the butler was awaiting my arrival he had received by the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction and had sent at once for a locksmith and a carpenter the tradesmen came while we were yet speaking and we moved in a body to old dr denmans surgical theatre from which as you are doubtless aware jekylls private cabinet is most conveniently entered the door was very strong the lock excellent the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and have to do much damage if force were to be used and the locksmith was near despair but this last was a handy fellow and after two hours work the door stood open the press marked e was unlocked and i took out the drawer had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet and returned with it to cavendish square  here i proceeded to examine its contents the powders were neatly enough made up but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist so that it was plain they were of jekylls private manufacture and when i opened one of the wrappers i found what seemed to me a simple crystalline salt of a white colour the phial to which i next turned my attention might have been about half full of a bloodred liquor which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to contain phosphorus and some volatile ether at the other ingredients i could make no guess the book was an ordinary version book and contained little but a series of dates these covered a period of many years but i observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly here and there a brief remark was appended to a date usually no more than a single word  double occurring perhaps six times in a total of several hundred entries and once very early in the list and followed by several marks of exclamation total failure all this though it whetted my curiosity told me little that was definite here were a phial of some salt and the record of a series of experiments that had led like too many of jekylls investigations to no end of practical usefulness how could the presence of these articles in my house affect either the honour the sanity or the life of my flighty colleague if his messenger could go to one place why could he not go to another and even granting some impediment why was this gentleman to be received by me in secret the more i reflected the more convinced i grew that i was dealing with a case of cerebral disease and though i dismissed my servants to bed i loaded an old revolver that i might be found in some posture of selfdefence  twelve oclock had scarce rung out over london ere the knocker sounded very gently on the door i went myself at the summons and found a small man crouching against the pillars of the portico  are you come from dr jekyll i asked  he told me yes by a constrained gesture and when i had bidden him enter he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the darkness of the square there was a policeman not far off advancing with his bulls eye open and at the sight i thought my visitor started and made greater haste  these particulars struck me i confess disagreeably and as i followed him into the bright light of the consulting room i kept my hand ready on my weapon here at last i had a chance of clearly seeing him i had never set eyes on him before so much was certain he was small as i have said i was struck besides with the shocking expression of his face with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and great apparent debility of constitution andlast but not leastwith the odd subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood this bore some resemblance to incipient rigour and was accompanied by a marked sinking of the pulse at the time i set it down to some idiosyncratic personal distaste and merely wondered at the acuteness of the symptoms but i have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in the nature of man and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle of hatred  this person who had thus from the first moment of his entrance struck in me what i can only describe as a disgustful curiosity was dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable his clothes that is to say although they were of rich and sober fabric were enormously too large for him in every measurementthe trousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from the ground the waist of the coat below his haunches and the collar sprawling wide upon his shoulders strange to relate this ludicrous accoutrement was far from moving me to laughter rather as there was something abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature that now faced mesomething seizing surprising and revoltingthis fresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it so that to my interest in the mans nature and character there was added a curiosity as to his origin his life his fortune and status in the world  these observations though they have taken so great a space to be set down in were yet the work of a few seconds my visitor was indeed on fire with sombre excitement  have you got it he cried have you got it and so lively was his impatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake me  i put him back conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my blood come sir said i you forget that i have not yet the pleasure of your acquaintance be seated if you please and i showed him an example and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient as the lateness of the hour the nature of my preoccupations and the horror i had of my visitor would suffer me to muster  i beg your pardon dr lanyon he replied civilly enough what you say is very well founded and my impatience has shown its heels to my politeness i come here at the instance of your colleague dr henry jekyll on a piece of business of some moment and i understood he paused and put his hand to his throat and i could see in spite of his collected manner that he was wrestling against the approaches of the hysteriai understood a drawer  but here i took pity on my visitors suspense and some perhaps on my own growing curiosity  there it is sir said i pointing to the drawer where it lay on the floor behind a table and still covered with the sheet  he sprang to it and then paused and laid his hand upon his heart i could hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws and his face was so ghastly to see that i grew alarmed both for his life and reason  compose yourself said i  he turned a dreadful smile to me and as if with the decision of despair plucked away the sheet at sight of the contents he uttered one loud sob of such immense relief that i sat petrified and the next moment in a voice that was already fairly well under control have you a graduated glass he asked  i rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he asked  he thanked me with a smiling nod measured out a few minims of the red tincture and added one of the powders the mixture which was at first of a reddish hue began in proportion as the crystals melted to brighten in colour to effervesce audibly and to throw off small fumes of vapour suddenly and at the same moment the ebullition ceased and the compound changed to a dark purple which faded again more slowly to a watery green my visitor who had watched these metamorphoses with a keen eye smiled set down the glass upon the table and then turned and looked upon me with an air of scrutiny  and now said he to settle what remains will you be wise will you be guided will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to go forth from your house without further parley or has the greed of curiosity too much command of you think before you answer for it shall be done as you decide as you decide you shall be left as you were before and neither richer nor wiser unless the sense of service rendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul or if you shall so prefer to choose a new province of knowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you here in this room upon the instant and your sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of satan  sir said i affecting a coolness that i was far from truly possessing you speak enigmas and you will perhaps not wonder that i hear you with no very strong impression of belief but i have gone too far in the way of inexplicable services to pause before i see the end  it is well replied my visitor lanyon you remember your vows  what follows is under the seal of our profession and now you who have so long been bound to the most narrow and material views you who have denied the virtue of transcendental medicine you who have derided your superiorsbehold  he put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp a cry followed he reeled staggered clutched at the table and held on staring with injected eyes gasping with open mouth and as i looked there came i thought a changehe seemed to swellhis face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alterand the next moment i had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall my arms raised to shield me from that prodigy my mind submerged in terror  o god i screamed and o god again and again for there before my eyespale and shaken and half fainting and groping before him with his hands like a man restored from deaththere stood henry jekyll  what he told me in the next hour i cannot bring my mind to set on paper i saw what i saw i heard what i heard and my soul sickened at it and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes i ask myself if i believe it and i cannot answer my life is shaken to its roots sleep has left me the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the day and night and i feel that my days are numbered and that i must die and yet i shall die incredulous as for the moral turpitude that man unveiled to me even with tears of penitence i cannot even in memory dwell on it without a start of horror i will say but one thing utterson and that if you can bring your mind to credit it will be more than enough the creature who crept into my house that night was on jekylls own confession known by the name of hyde and hunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of carew  hastie lanyon     henry jekylls full statement of the case  i was born in the year 18 to a large fortune endowed besides with excellent parts inclined by nature to industry fond of the respect of the wise and good among my fellowmen and thus as might have been supposed with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished future and indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient gaiety of disposition such as has made the happiness of many but such as i found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my head high and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public hence it came about that i concealed my pleasures and that when i reached years of reflection and began to look round me and take stock of my progress and position in the world i stood already committed to a profound duplicity of life many a man would have even blazoned such irregularities as i was guilty of but from the high views that i had set before me i regarded and hid them with an almost morbid sense of shame it was thus rather the exacting nature of my aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults that made me what i was and with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound mans dual nature in this case i was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life which lies at the root of religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress though so profound a doubledealer i was in no sense a hypocrite both sides of me were in dead earnest i was no more myself when i laid aside restraint and plunged in shame than when i laboured in the eye of day at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering and it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental reacted and shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my members with every day and from both sides of my intelligence the moral and the intellectual i thus drew steadily nearer to that truth by whose partial discovery i have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck  that man is not truly one but truly two i say two because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point others will follow others will outstrip me on the same lines and i hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious incongruous and independent denizens i for my part from the nature of my life advanced infallibly in one direction and in one direction only it was on the moral side and in my own person that i learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man i saw that of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness even if i could rightly be said to be either it was only because i was radically both and from an early date even before the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked possibility of such a miracle i had learned to dwell with pleasure as a beloved daydream on the thought of the separation of these elements if each i told myself could be housed in separate identities life would be relieved of all that was unbearable the unjust might go his way delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright twin and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path doing the good things in which he found his pleasure and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil it was the curse of mankind that these incongruous faggots were thus bound togetherthat in the agonised womb of consciousness these polar twins should be continuously struggling how then were they dissociated  i was so far in my reflections when as i have said a side light began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table i began to perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated the trembling immateriality the mistlike transience of this seemingly so solid body in which we walk attired certain agents i found to have the power to shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion for two good reasons i will not enter deeply into this scientific branch of my confession first because i have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound for ever on mans shoulders and when the attempt is made to cast it off it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure second because as my narrative will make alas too evident my discoveries were incomplete enough then that i not only recognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the powers that made up my spirit but managed to compound a drug by which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy and a second form and countenance substituted none the less natural to me because they were the expression and bore the stamp of lower elements in my soul  i hesitated long before i put this theory to the test of practice i knew well that i risked death for any drug that so potently controlled and shook the very fortress of identity might by the least scruple of an overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which i looked to it to change but the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at last overcame the suggestions of alarm i had long since prepared my tincture i purchased at once from a firm of wholesale chemists a large quantity of a particular salt which i knew from my experiments to be the last ingredient required and late one accursed night i compounded the elements watched them boil and smoke together in the glass and when the ebullition had subsided with a strong glow of courage drank off the potion  the most racking pangs succeeded  a grinding in the bones deadly nausea and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or death then these agonies began swiftly to subside and i came to myself as if out of a great sickness there was something strange in my sensations something indescribably new and from its very novelty incredibly sweet i felt younger lighter happier in body within i was conscious of a heady recklessness a current of disordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy a solution of the bonds of obligation an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul i knew myself at the first breath of this new life to be more wicked tenfold more wicked sold a slave to my original evil and the thought in that moment braced and delighted me like wine i stretched out my hands exulting in the freshness of these sensations and in the act i was suddenly aware that i had lost in stature  there was no mirror at that date in my room that which stands beside me as i write was brought there later on and for the very purpose of these transformations the night however was far gone into the morningthe morning black as it was was nearly ripe for the conception of the daythe inmates of my house were locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber and i determined flushed as i was with hope and triumph to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom i crossed the yard wherein the constellations looked down upon me i could have thought with wonder the first creature of that sort that their unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them i stole through the corridors a stranger in my own house and coming to my room i saw for the first time the appearance of edward hyde  i must here speak by theory alone saying not that which i know but that which i suppose to be most probable the evil side of my nature to which i had now transferred the stamping efficacy was less robust and less developed than the good which i had just deposed again in the course of my life which had been after all nine tenths a life of effort virtue and control it had been much less exercised and much less exhausted and hence as i think it came about that edward hyde was so much smaller slighter and younger than henry jekyll even as good shone upon the countenance of the one evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other evil besides which i must still believe to be the lethal side of man had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay and yet when i looked upon that ugly idol in the glass i was conscious of no repugnance rather of a leap of welcome this too was myself it seemed natural and human in my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit it seemed more express and single than the imperfect and divided countenance i had been hitherto accustomed to call mine and in so far i was doubtless right i have observed that when i wore the semblance of edward hyde none could come near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh this as i take it was because all human beings as we meet them are commingled out of good and evil  and edward hyde alone in the ranks of mankind was pure evil  i lingered but a moment at the mirror  the second and conclusive experiment had yet to be attempted it yet remained to be seen if i had lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a house that was no longer mine and hurrying back to my cabinet i once more prepared and drank the cup once more suffered the pangs of dissolution and came to myself once more with the character the stature and the face of henry jekyll  that night i had come to the fatal crossroads had i approached my discovery in a more noble spirit had i risked the experiment while under the empire of generous or pious aspirations all must have been otherwise and from these agonies of death and birth i had come forth an angel instead of a fiend the drug had no discriminating action it was neither diabolical nor divine it but shook the doors of the prisonhouse of my disposition and like the captives of philippi that which stood within ran forth at that time my virtue slumbered my evil kept awake by ambition was alert and swift to seize the occasion and the thing that was projected was edward hyde hence although i had now two characters as well as two appearances one was wholly evil and the other was still the old henry jekyll that incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement i had already learned to despair the movement was thus wholly toward the worse  even at that time i had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a life of study i would still be merrily disposed at times and as my pleasures were to say the least undignified and i was not only well known and highly considered but growing towards the elderly man this incoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome it was on this side that my new power tempted me until i fell in slavery i had but to drink the cup to doff at once the body of the noted professor and to assume like a thick cloak that of edward hyde i smiled at the notion it seemed to me at the time to be humourous and i made my preparations with the most studious care i took and furnished that house in soho to which hyde was tracked by the police and engaged as a housekeeper a creature whom i knew well to be silent and unscrupulous on the other side i announced to my servants that a mr hyde whom i described was to have full liberty and power about my house in the square and to parry mishaps i even called and made myself a familiar object in my second character i next drew up that will to which you so much objected so that if anything befell me in the person of dr jekyll i could enter on that of edward hyde without pecuniary loss and thus fortified as i supposed on every side i began to profit by the strange immunities of my position  men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes while their own person and reputation sat under shelter i was the first that ever did so for his pleasures i was the first that could plod in the public eye with a load of genial respectability and in a moment like a schoolboy strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty but for me in my impenetrable mantle the safety was complete think of iti did not even exist let me but escape into my laboratory door give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the draught that i had always standing ready and whatever he had done edward hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror and there in his stead quietly at home trimming the midnight lamp in his study a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion would be henry jekyll  the pleasures which i made haste to seek in my disguise were as i have said undignified i would scarce use a harder term but in the hands of edward hyde they soon began to turn toward the monstrous when i would come back from these excursions i was often plunged into a kind of wonder at my vicarious depravity this familiar that i called out of my own soul and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure was a being inherently malign and villainous his every act and thought centered on self drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture to another relentless like a man of stone henry jekyll stood at times aghast before the acts of edward hyde but the situation was apart from ordinary laws and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience it was hyde after all and hyde alone that was guilty jekyll was no worse he woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired he would even make haste where it was possible to undo the evil done by hyde and thus his conscience slumbered  into the details of the infamy at which i thus connived for even now i can scarce grant that i committed it i have no design of entering i mean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which my chastisement approached i met with one accident which as it brought on no consequence i shall no more than mention an act of cruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passerby whom i recognised the other day in the person of your kinsman the doctor and the childs family joined him there were moments when i feared for my life and at last in order to pacify their too just resentment edward hyde had to bring them to the door and pay them in a cheque drawn in the name of henry jekyll but this danger was easily eliminated from the future by opening an account at another bank in the name of edward hyde himself and when by sloping my own hand backward i had supplied my double with a signature i thought i sat beyond the reach of fate  some two months before the murder of sir danvers i had been out for one of my adventures had returned at a late hour and woke the next day in bed with somewhat odd sensations it was in vain i looked about me in vain i saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room in the square in vain that i recognised the pattern of the bed curtains and the design of the mahogany frame something still kept insisting that i was not where i was that i had not wakened where i seemed to be but in the little room in soho where i was accustomed to sleep in the body of edward hyde i smiled to myself and in my psychological way began lazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion occasionally even as i did so dropping back into a comfortable morning doze i was still so engaged when in one of my more wakeful moments my eyes fell upon my hand now the hand of henry jekyll as you have often remarked was professional in shape and size it was large firm white and comely but the hand which i now saw clearly enough in the yellow light of a midlondon morning lying half shut on the bedclothes was lean corded knuckly of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair it was the hand of edward hyde  i must have stared upon it for near half a minute sunk as i was in the mere stupidity of wonder before terror woke up in my breast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals and bounding from my bed i rushed to the mirror at the sight that met my eyes my blood was changed into something exquisitely thin and icy yes i had gone to bed henry jekyll i had awakened edward hyde how was this to be explained i asked myself and then with another bound of terrorhow was it to be remedied it was well on in the morning the servants were up all my drugs were in the cabineta long journey down two pairs of stairs through the back passage across the open court and through the anatomical theatre from where i was then standing horrorstruck it might indeed be possible to cover my face but of what use was that when i was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature and then with an overpowering sweetness of relief it came back upon my mind that the servants were already used to the coming and going of my second self i had soon dressed as well as i was able in clothes of my own size  had soon passed through the house where bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing mr hyde at such an hour and in such a strange array and ten minutes later dr jekyll had returned to his own shape and was sitting down with a darkened brow to make a feint of breakfasting  small indeed was my appetite this inexplicable incident this reversal of my previous experience seemed like the babylonian finger on the wall to be spelling out the letters of my judgment and i began to reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities of my double existence that part of me which i had the power of projecting had lately been much exercised and nourished it had seemed to me of late as though the body of edward hyde had grown in stature as though when i wore that form i were conscious of a more generous tide of blood and i began to spy a danger that if this were much prolonged the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown the power of voluntary change be forfeited and the character of edward hyde become irrevocably mine the power of the drug had not been always equally displayed once very early in my career it had totally failed me since then i had been obliged on more than one occasion to double and once with infinite risk of death to treble the amount and these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment now however and in the light of that mornings accident i was led to remark that whereas in the beginning the difficulty had been to throw off the body of jekyll it had of late gradually but decidedly transferred itself to the other side all things therefore seemed to point to this that i was slowly losing hold of my original and better self and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse  between these two i now felt i had to choose my two natures had memory in common but all other faculties were most unequally shared between them jekyll who was composite now with the most sensitive apprehensions now with a greedy gusto projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of hyde but hyde was indifferent to jekyll or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in which he conceals himself from pursuit jekyll had more than a fathers interest hyde had more than a sons indifference to cast in my lot with jekyll was to die to those appetites which i had long secretly indulged and had of late begun to pamper to cast it in with hyde was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations and to become at a blow and forever despised and friendless the bargain might appear unequal but there was still another consideration in the scales for while jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence hyde would be not even conscious of all that he had lost strange as my circumstances were the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as man much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted and trembling sinner and it fell out with me as it falls with so vast a majority of my fellows that i chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it  yes i preferred the elderly and discontented doctor surrounded by friends and cherishing honest hopes and bade a resolute farewell to the liberty the comparative youth the light step leaping impulses and secret pleasures that i had enjoyed in the disguise of hyde i made this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation for i neither gave up the house in soho nor destroyed the clothes of edward hyde which still lay ready in my cabinet for two months however i was true to my determination for two months i led a life of such severity as i had never before attained to and enjoyed the compensations of an approving conscience but time began at last to obliterate the freshness of my alarm the praises of conscience began to grow into a thing of course i began to be tortured with throes and longings as of hyde struggling after freedom and at last in an hour of moral weakness i once again compounded and swallowed the transforming draught  i do not suppose that when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his vice he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that he runs through his brutish physical insensibility neither had i long as i had considered my position made enough allowance for the complete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil which were the leading characters of edward hyde yet it was by these that i was punished my devil had been long caged he came out roaring i was conscious even when i took the draught of a more unbridled a more furious propensity to ill it must have been this i suppose that stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which i listened to the civilities of my unhappy victim i declare at least before god no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation and that i struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything but i had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations and in my case to be tempted however slightly was to fall  instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged with a transport of glee i mauled the unresisting body tasting delight from every blow and it was not till weariness had begun to succeed that i was suddenly in the top fit of my delirium struck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror a mist dispersed i saw my life to be forfeit and fled from the scene of these excesses at once glorying and trembling my lust of evil gratified and stimulated my love of life screwed to the topmost peg i ran to the house in soho and to make assurance doubly sure destroyed my papers thence i set out through the lamplit streets in the same divided ecstasy of mind gloating on my crime lightheadedly devising others in the future and yet still hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught and as he drank it pledged the dead man the pangs of transformation had not done tearing him before henry jekyll with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped hands to god the veil of selfindulgence was rent from head to foot i saw my life as a whole  i followed it up from the days of childhood when i had walked with my fathers hand and through the selfdenying toils of my professional life to arrive again and again with the same sense of unreality at the damned horrors of the evening i could have screamed aloud i sought with tears and prayers to smother down the crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against me and still between the petitions the ugly face of my iniquity stared into my soul as the acuteness of this remorse began to die away it was succeeded by a sense of joy the problem of my conduct was solved hyde was thenceforth impossible whether i would or not i was now confined to the better part of my existence and o how i rejoiced to think of it with what willing humility i embraced anew the restrictions of natural life with what sincere renunciation i locked the door by which i had so often gone and come and ground the key under my heel  the next day came the news that the murder had not been overlooked that the guilt of hyde was patent to the world and that the victim was a man high in public estimation it was not only a crime it had been a tragic folly i think i was glad to know it i think i was glad to have my better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the scaffold jekyll was now my city of refuge let but hyde peep out an instant and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him  i resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past and i can say with honesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good you know yourself how earnestly in the last months of the last year i laboured to relieve suffering you know that much was done for others and that the days passed quietly almost happily for myself nor can i truly say that i wearied of this beneficent and innocent life i think instead that i daily enjoyed it more completely but i was still cursed with my duality of purpose and as the first edge of my penitence wore off the lower side of me so long indulged so recently chained down began to growl for licence not that i dreamed of resuscitating hyde the bare idea of that would startle me to frenzy  no it was in my own person that i was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience and it was as an ordinary secret sinner that i at last fell before the assaults of temptation  there comes an end to all things the most capacious measure is filled at last and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed the balance of my soul and yet i was not alarmed the fall seemed natural like a return to the old days before i had made my discovery it was a fine clear january day wet under foot where the frost had melted but cloudless overhead and the regents park was full of winter chirrupings and sweet with spring odours i sat in the sun on a bench the animal within me licking the chops of memory the spiritual side a little drowsed promising subsequent penitence but not yet moved to begin after all i reflected i was like my neighbours and then i smiled comparing myself with other men comparing my active goodwill with the lazy cruelty of their neglect and at the very moment of that vainglorious thought a qualm came over me a horrid nausea and the most deadly shuddering these passed away and left me faint and then as in its turn faintness subsided i began to be aware of a change in the temper of my thoughts a greater boldness a contempt of danger a solution of the bonds of obligation i looked down my clothes hung formlessly on my shrunken limbs the hand that lay on my knee was corded and hairy i was once more edward hyde a moment before i had been safe of all mens respect wealthy belovedthe cloth laying for me in the diningroom at home and now i was the common quarry of mankind hunted houseless a known murderer thrall to the gallows  my reason wavered but it did not fail me utterly i have more than once observed that in my second character my faculties seemed sharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic thus it came about that where jekyll perhaps might have succumbed hyde rose to the importance of the moment my drugs were in one of the presses of my cabinet how was i to reach them that was the problem that crushing my temples in my hands i set myself to solve the laboratory door i had closed if i sought to enter by the house my own servants would consign me to the gallows i saw i must employ another hand and thought of lanyon how was he to be reached how persuaded supposing that i escaped capture in the streets how was i to make my way into his presence and how should i an unknown and displeasing visitor prevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague dr jekyll then i remembered that of my original character one part remained to me  i could write my own hand and once i had conceived that kindling spark the way that i must follow became lighted up from end to end  thereupon i arranged my clothes as best i could and summoning a passing hansom drove to an hotel in portland street the name of which i chanced to remember at my appearance which was indeed comical enough however tragic a fate these garments covered the driver could not conceal his mirth i gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of devilish fury and the smile withered from his facehappily for himyet more happily for myself for in another instant i had certainly dragged him from his perch at the inn as i entered i looked about me with so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble not a look did they exchange in my presence but obsequiously took my orders led me to a private room and brought me wherewithal to write hyde in danger of his life was a creature new to me shaken with inordinate anger strung to the pitch of murder lusting to inflict pain yet the creature was astute mastered his fury with a great effort of the will composed his two important letters one to lanyon and one to poole and that he might receive actual evidence of their being posted sent them out with directions that they should be registered thenceforward he sat all day over the fire in the private room gnawing his nails there he dined sitting alone with his fears the waiter visibly quailing before his eye and thence when the night was fully come he set forth in the corner of a closed cab and was driven to and fro about the streets of the city he i sayi cannot say i that child of hell had nothing human nothing lived in him but fear and hatred and when at last thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious he discharged the cab and ventured on foot attired in his misfitting clothes an object marked out for observation into the midst of the nocturnal passengers these two base passions raged within him like a tempest he walked fast hunted by his fears chattering to himself skulking through the less frequented thoroughfares counting the minutes that still divided him from midnight once a woman spoke to him offering i think a box of lights he smote her in the face and she fled  when i came to myself at lanyons the horror of my old friend perhaps affected me somewhat  i do not know it was at least but a drop in the sea to the abhorrence with which i looked back upon these hours a change had come over me it was no longer the fear of the gallows it was the horror of being hyde that racked me i received lanyons condemnation partly in a dream it was partly in a dream that i came home to my own house and got into bed i slept after the prostration of the day with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the nightmares that wrung me could avail to break i awoke in the morning shaken weakened but refreshed i still hated and feared the thought of the brute that slept within me and i had not of course forgotten the appalling dangers of the day before but i was once more at home in my own house and close to my drugs and gratitude for my escape shone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of hope  i was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast drinking the chill of the air with pleasure when i was seized again with those indescribable sensations that heralded the change and i had but the time to gain the shelter of my cabinet before i was once again raging and freezing with the passions of hyde it took on this occasion a double dose to recall me to myself and alas six hours after as i sat looking sadly in the fire the pangs returned and the drug had to be readministered in short from that day forth it seemed only by a great effort as of gymnastics and only under the immediate stimulation of the drug that i was able to wear the countenance of jekyll at all hours of the day and night i would be taken with the premonitory shudder above all if i slept or even dozed for a moment in my chair it was always as hyde that i awakened under the strain of this continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which i now condemned myself ay even beyond what i had thought possible to man i became in my own person a creature eaten up and emptied by fever languidly weak both in body and mind and solely occupied by one thought  the horror of my other self but when i slept or when the virtue of the medicine wore off i would leap almost without transition for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked into the possession of a fancy brimming with images of terror a soul boiling with causeless hatreds and a body that seemed not strong enough to contain the raging energies of life the powers of hyde seemed to have grown with the sickliness of jekyll and certainly the hate that now divided them was equal on each side with jekyll it was a thing of vital instinct he had now seen the full deformity of that creature that shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness and was coheir with him to death  and beyond these links of community which in themselves made the most poignant part of his distress he thought of hyde for all his energy of life as of something not only hellish but inorganic this was the shocking thing that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned that what was dead and had no shape should usurp the offices of life and this again that that insurgent horror was knit to him closer than a wife closer than an eye lay caged in his flesh where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born and at every hour of weakness and in the confidence of slumber prevailed against him and deposed him out of life the hatred of hyde for jekyll was of a different order his terror of the gallows drove him continually to commit temporary suicide and return to his subordinate station of a part instead of a person but he loathed the necessity he loathed the despondency into which jekyll was now fallen and he resented the dislike with which he was himself regarded hence the apelike tricks that he would play me scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the pages of my books burning the letters and destroying the portrait of my father and indeed had it not been for his fear of death he would long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin but his love of life is wonderful i go further  i who sicken and freeze at the mere thought of him when i recall the abjection and passion of this attachment and when i know how he fears my power to cut him off by suicide i find it in my heart to pity him  it is useless and the time awfully fails me to prolong this description no one has ever suffered such torments let that suffice and yet even to these habit broughtno not alleviationbut a certain callousness of soul a certain acquiescence of despair and my punishment might have gone on for years but for the last calamity which has now fallen and which has finally severed me from my own face and nature my provision of the salt which had never been renewed since the date of the first experiment began to run low i sent out for a fresh supply and mixed the draught the ebullition followed and the first change of colour not the second i drank it and it was without efficiency you will learn from poole how i have had london ransacked it was in vain and i am now persuaded that my first supply was impure and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy to the draught  about a week has passed and i am now finishing this statement under the influence of the last of the old powders this then is the last time short of a miracle that henry jekyll can think his own thoughts or see his own face now how sadly altered in the glass nor must i delay too long to bring my writing to an end for if my narrative has hitherto escaped destruction it has been by a combination of great prudence and great good luck should the throes of change take me in the act of writing it hyde will tear it in pieces but if some time shall have elapsed after i have laid it by his wonderful selfishness and circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from the action of his apelike spite and indeed the doom that is closing on us both has already changed and crushed him half an hour from now when i shall again and forever reindue that hated personality i know how i shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair or continue with the most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening to pace up and down this room my last earthly refuge and give ear to every sound of menace will hyde die upon the scaffold or will he find courage to release himself at the last moment god knows i am careless this is my true hour of death and what is to follow concerns another than myself here then as i lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my confession i bring the life of that unhappy henry jekyll to an end,the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde,robert louis stevenson
part one the old buccaneer     i the old seadog at the admiral benbow   squire trelawney dr livesey and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about treasure island from the beginning to the end keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted i take up my pen in the year of grace 17 and go back to the time when my father kept the admiral benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof  i remember him as if it were yesterday as he came plodding to the inn door his seachest following behind him in a handbarrow a tall strong heavy nutbrown man his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat his hands ragged and scarred with black broken nails and the sabre cut across one cheek a dirty livid white i remember him looking round the cove and whistling to himself as he did so and then breaking out in that old seasong that he sang so often afterwards             fifteen men on the dead mans chest               yohoho and a bottle of rum  in the high old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried and when my father appeared called roughly for a glass of rum this when it was brought to him he drank slowly like a connoisseur lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard  this is a handy cove says he at length and a pleasant sittyated grogshop much company mate  my father told him no very little company the more was the pity  well then said he this is the berth for me here you matey he cried to the man who trundled the barrow bring up alongside and help up my chest ill stay here a bit he continued im a plain man rum and bacon and eggs is what i want and that head up there for to watch ships off what you mought call me you mought call me captain oh i see what youre at there and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold you can tell me when ive worked through that says he looking as fierce as a commander  and indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast but seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike the man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at the royal george that he had inquired what inns there were along the coast and hearing ours well spoken of i suppose and described as lonely had chosen it from the others for his place of residence and that was all we could learn of our guest  he was a very silent man by custom all day he hung round the cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescope all evening he sat in a corner of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong mostly he would not speak when spoken to only look up sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a foghorn and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be every day when he came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road at first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them when a seaman did put up at the admiral benbow as now and then some did making by the coast road for bristol he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present for me at least there was no secret about the matter for i was in a way a sharer in his alarms he had taken me aside one day and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if i would only keep my weathereye open for a seafaring man with one leg  and let him know the moment he appeared often enough when the first of the month came round and i applied to him for my wage he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it bring me my fourpenny piece and repeat his orders to look out for the seafaring man with one leg  how that personage haunted my dreams i need scarcely tell you on stormy nights when the wind shook the four corners of the house and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs i would see him in a thousand forms and with a thousand diabolical expressions now the leg would be cut off at the knee now at the hip now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg and that in the middle of his body to see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares and altogether i paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece in the shape of these abominable fancies  but though i was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg i was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him there were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked old wild seasongs minding nobody but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing often i have heard the house shaking with yohoho and a bottle of rum all the neighbours joining in for dear life with the fear of death upon them and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark for in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question or sometimes because none was put and so he judged the company was not following his story nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed  his stories were what frightened people worst of all dreadful stories they were about hanging and walking the plank and storms at sea and the dry tortugas and wild deeds and places on the spanish main by his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that god ever allowed upon the sea and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described my father was always saying the inn would be ruined for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down and sent shivering to their beds but i really believe his presence did us good people were frightened at the time but on looking back they rather liked it it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him calling him a true seadog and a real old salt and such like names and saying there was the sort of man that made england terrible at sea  in one way indeed he bade fair to ruin us for he kept on staying week after week and at last month after month so that all the money had been long exhausted and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more if ever he mentioned it the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared and stared my poor father out of the room i have seen him wringing his hands after such a rebuff and i am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death  all the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker one of the cocks of his hat having fallen down he let it hang from that day forth though it was a great annoyance when it blew i remember the appearance of his coat which he patched himself upstairs in his room and which before the end was nothing but patches he never wrote or received a letter and he never spoke with any but the neighbours and with these for the most part only when drunk on rum the great seachest none of us had ever seen open  he was only once crossed and that was towards the end when my poor father was far gone in a decline that took him off dr livesey came late one afternoon to see the patient took a bit of dinner from my mother and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should come down from the hamlet for we had no stabling at the old benbow i followed him in and i remember observing the contrast the neat bright doctor with his powder as white as snow and his bright black eyes and pleasant manners made with the coltish country folk and above all with that filthy heavy bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours sitting far gone in rum with his arms on the table suddenly he the captain that is began to pipe up his eternal song             fifteen men on the dead mans chest               yohoho and a bottle of rum            drink and the devil had done for the rest               yohoho and a bottle of rum  at first i had supposed the dead mans chest to be that identical big box of his upstairs in the front room and the thought had been mingled in my nightmares with that of the onelegged seafaring man but by this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song it was new that night to nobody but dr livesey and on him i observed it did not produce an agreeable effect for he looked up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his talk to old taylor the gardener on a new cure for the rheumatics in the meantime the captain gradually brightened up at his own music and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence the voices stopped at once all but dr liveseys he went on as before speaking clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or two the captain glared at him for a while flapped his hand again glared still harder and at last broke out with a villainous low oath silence there between decks  were you addressing me sir says the doctor and when the ruffian had told him with another oath that this was so i have only one thing to say to you sir replies the doctor that if you keep on drinking rum the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel  the old fellows fury was awful he sprang to his feet drew and opened a sailors claspknife and balancing it open on the palm of his hand threatened to pin the doctor to the wall  the doctor never so much as moved he spoke to him as before over his shoulder and in the same tone of voice rather high so that all the room might hear but perfectly calm and steady  if you do not put that knife this instant in your pocket i promise upon my honour you shall hang at the next assizes  then followed a battle of looks between them but the captain soon knuckled under put up his weapon and resumed his seat grumbling like a beaten dog  and now sir continued the doctor since i now know theres such a fellow in my district you may count ill have an eye upon you day and night im not a doctor only im a magistrate and if i catch a breath of complaint against you if its only for a piece of incivility like tonights ill take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed out of this let that suffice  soon after dr liveseys horse came to the door and he rode away but the captain held his peace that evening and for many evenings to come     ii black dog appears and disappears   it was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain though not as you will see of his affairs it was a bitter cold winter with long hard frosts and heavy gales and it was plain from the first that my poor father was little likely to see the spring he sank daily and my mother and i had all the inn upon our hands and were kept busy enough without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest  it was one january morning very early a pinching frosty morning the cove all grey with hoarfrost the ripple lapping softly on the stones the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to seaward the captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the beach his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat his brass telescope under his arm his hat tilted back upon his head i remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off and the last sound i heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort of indignation as though his mind was still running upon dr livesey  well mother was upstairs with father and i was laying the breakfasttable against the captains return when the parlour door opened and a man stepped in on whom i had never set my eyes before he was a pale tallowy creature wanting two fingers of the left hand and though he wore a cutlass he did not look much like a fighter i had always my eye open for seafaring men with one leg or two and i remember this one puzzled me he was not sailorly and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too  i asked him what was for his service and he said he would take rum but as i was going out of the room to fetch it he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near i paused where i was with my napkin in my hand  come here sonny says he come nearer here  i took a step nearer  is this here table for my mate bill he asked with a kind of leer  i told him i did not know his mate bill and this was for a person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain  well said he my mate bill would be called the captain as like as not he has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him particularly in drink has my mate bill well put it for argument like that your captain has a cut on one cheek and well put it if you like that that cheeks the right one ah well i told you now is my mate bill in this here house  i told him he was out walking  which way sonny which way is he gone  and when i had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was likely to return and how soon and answered a few other questions ah said he thisll be as good as drink to my mate bill  the expression of his face as he said these words was not at all pleasant and i had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistaken even supposing he meant what he said but it was no affair of mine i thought and besides it was difficult to know what to do the stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door peering round the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse once i stepped out myself into the road but he immediately called me back and as i did not obey quick enough for his fancy a most horrible change came over his tallowy face and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump as soon as i was back again he returned to his former manner half fawning half sneering patted me on the shoulder told me i was a good boy and he had taken quite a fancy to me i have a son of my own said he as like you as two blocks and hes all the pride of my art but the great thing for boys is discipline sonny discipline now if you had sailed along of bill you wouldnt have stood there to be spoke to twice not you that was never bills way nor the way of sich as sailed with him and here sure enough is my mate bill with a spyglass under his arm bless his old art to be sure you and mell just go back into the parlour sonny and get behind the door and well give bill a little surprise bless his art i say again  so saying the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door i was very uneasy and alarmed as you may fancy and it rather added to my fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself he cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt what we used to call a lump in the throat  at last in strode the captain slammed the door behind him without looking to the right or left and marched straight across the room to where his breakfast awaited him  bill said the stranger in a voice that i thought he had tried to make bold and big  the captain spun round on his heel and fronted us all the brown had gone out of his face and even his nose was blue he had the look of a man who sees a ghost or the evil one or something worse if anything can be and upon my word i felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn so old and sick  come bill you know me you know an old shipmate bill surely said the stranger  the captain made a sort of gasp  black dog said he  and who else returned the other getting more at his ease black dog as ever was come for to see his old shipmate billy at the admiral benbow inn ah bill bill we have seen a sight of times us two since i lost them two talons holding up his mutilated hand  now look here said the captain youve run me down here i am well then speak up what is it  thats you bill returned black dog youre in the right of it billy ill have a glass of rum from this dear child here as ive took such a liking to and well sit down if you please and talk square like old shipmates  when i returned with the rum they were already seated on either side of the captains breakfasttable black dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one as i thought on his retreat  he bade me go and leave the door wide open none of your keyholes for me sonny he said and i left them together and retired into the bar  for a long time though i certainly did my best to listen i could hear nothing but a low gattling but at last the voices began to grow higher and i could pick up a word or two mostly oaths from the captain  no no no no and an end of it he cried once and again if it comes to swinging swing all say i  then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and other noises the chair and table went over in a lump a clash of steel followed and then a cry of pain and the next instant i saw black dog in full flight and the captain hotly pursuing both with drawn cutlasses and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder just at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous cut which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been intercepted by our big signboard of admiral benbow you may see the notch on the lower side of the frame to this day  that blow was the last of the battle once out upon the road black dog in spite of his wound showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute the captain for his part stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man then he passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into the house  jim says he rum and as he spoke he reeled a little and caught himself with one hand against the wall  are you hurt cried i  rum he repeated i must get away from here rum rum  i ran to fetch it but i was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out and i broke one glass and fouled the tap and while i was still getting in my own way i heard a loud fall in the parlour and running in beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor at the same instant my mother alarmed by the cries and fighting came running downstairs to help me between us we raised his head he was breathing very loud and hard but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible colour  dear deary me cried my mother what a disgrace upon the house and your poor father sick  in the meantime we had no idea what to do to help the captain nor any other thought but that he had got his deathhurt in the scuffle with the stranger i got the rum to be sure and tried to put it down his throat but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron it was a happy relief for us when the door opened and doctor livesey came in on his visit to my father  oh doctor we cried what shall we do where is he wounded  wounded a fiddlesticks end said the doctor no more wounded than you or i the man has had a stroke as i warned him now mrs hawkins just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him if possible nothing about it for my part i must do my best to save this fellows trebly worthless life jim you get me a basin  when i got back with the basin the doctor had already ripped up the captains sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm it was tattooed in several places heres luck a fair wind and billy bones his fancy were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it done as i thought with great spirit  prophetic said the doctor touching this picture with his finger and now master billy bones if that be your name well have a look at the colour of your blood jim he said are you afraid of blood  no sir said i  well then said he you hold the basin and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein  a great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him first he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown then his glance fell upon me and he looked relieved but suddenly his colour changed and he tried to raise himself crying wheres black dog  there is no black dog here said the doctor except what you have on your own back you have been drinking rum you have had a stroke precisely as i told you and i have just very much against my own will dragged you headforemost out of the grave now mr bones   thats not my name he interrupted  much i care returned the doctor its the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance and i call you by it for the sake of shortness and what i have to say to you is this one glass of rum wont kill you but if you take one youll take another and another and i stake my wig if you dont break off short youll die do you understand that die and go to your own place like the man in the bible come now make an effort ill help you to your bed for once  between us with much trouble we managed to hoist him upstairs and laid him on his bed where his head fell back on the pillow as if he were almost fainting  now mind you said the doctor i clear my conscience the name of rum for you is death  and with that he went off to see my father taking me with him by the arm  this is nothing he said as soon as he had closed the door i have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile he should lie for a week where he is that is the best thing for him and you but another stroke would settle him     iii the black spot   about noon i stopped at the captains door with some cooling drinks and medicines he was lying very much as we had left him only a little higher and he seemed both weak and excited  jim he said youre the only one here thats worth anything and you know ive been always good to you never a month but ive given you a silver fourpenny for yourself and now you see mate im pretty low and deserted by all and jim youll bring me one noggin of rum now wont you matey  the doctor  i began  but he broke in cursing the doctor in a feeble voice but heartily doctors is all swabs he said and that doctor there why what do he know about seafaring men i been in places hot as pitch and mates dropping round with yellow jack and the blessed land aheaving like the sea with earthquakes what do the doctor know of lands like that and i lived on rum i tell you its been meat and drink and man and wife to me and if im not to have my rum now im a poor old hulk on a lee shore my bloodll be on you jim and that doctor swab and he ran on again for a while with curses look jim how my fingers fidges  he continued in the pleading tone i cant keep em still not i i havent had a drop this blessed day that doctors a fool i tell you if i dont have a dram o rum jim ill have the horrors i seen some on em already i seen old flint in the corner there behind you as plain as print i seen him and if i get the horrors im a man that has lived rough and ill raise cain your doctor hisself said one glass wouldnt hurt me ill give you a golden guinea for a noggin jim  he was growing more and more excited and this alarmed me for my father who was very low that day and needed quiet besides i was reassured by the doctors words now quoted to me and rather offended by the offer of a bribe  i want none of your money said i but what you owe my father ill get you one glass and no more  when i brought it to him he seized it greedily and drank it out  aye aye said he thats some better sure enough and now matey did that doctor say how long i was to lie here in this old berth  a week at least said i  thunder he cried a week i cant do that theyd have the black spot on me by then the lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment lubbers as couldnt keep what they got and want to nail what is anothers is that seamanly behaviour now i want to know but im a saving soul i never wasted good money of mine nor lost it neither and ill trick em again im not afraid on em ill shake out another reef matey and daddle em again  as he was thus speaking he had risen from bed with great difficulty holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out and moving his legs like so much dead weight his words spirited as they were in meaning contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered he paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge  that doctors done me he murmured my ears is singing lay me back  before i could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place where he lay for a while silent  jim he said at length you saw that seafaring man today  black dog i asked  ah black dog says he hes a bad un but theres worse that put him on now if i cant get away nohow and they tip me the black spot mind you its my old seachest theyre after you get on a horse you can cant you well then you get on a horse and go to well yes i will to that eternal doctor swab and tell him to pipe all hands magistrates and sich and hell lay em aboard at the admiral benbow all old flints crew man and boy all on em thats left i was first mate i was old flints first mate and im the ony one as knows the place he gave it me at savannah when he lay adying like as if i was to now you see but you wont peach unless they get the black spot on me or unless you see that black dog again or a seafaring man with one leg jim him above all  but what is the black spot captain i asked  thats a summons mate ill tell you if they get that but you keep your weathereye open jim and ill share with you equals upon my honour  he wandered a little longer his voice growing weaker but soon after i had given him his medicine which he took like a child with the remark if ever a seaman wanted drugs its me he fell at last into a heavy swoonlike sleep in which i left him what i should have done had all gone well i do not know probably i should have told the whole story to the doctor for i was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make an end of me but as things fell out my poor father died quite suddenly that evening which put all other matters on one side our natural distress the visits of the neighbours the arranging of the funeral and all the work of the inn to be carried on in the meanwhile kept me so busy that i had scarcely time to think of the captain far less to be afraid of him  he got downstairs next morning to be sure and had his meals as usual though he ate little and had more i am afraid than his usual supply of rum for he helped himself out of the bar scowling and blowing through his nose and no one dared to cross him on the night before the funeral he was as drunk as ever and it was shocking in that house of mourning to hear him singing away at his ugly old seasong but weak as he was we were all in the fear of death for him and the doctor was suddenly taken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after my fathers death i have said the captain was weak and indeed he seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength he clambered up and down stairs and went from the parlour to the bar and back again and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea holding on to the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man on a steep mountain he never particularly addressed me and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences but his temper was more flighty and allowing for his bodily weakness more violent than ever he had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table but with all that he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather wandering once for instance to our extreme wonder he piped up to a different air a kind of country lovesong that he must have learned in his youth before he had begun to follow the sea  so things passed until the day after the funeral and about three oclock of a bitter foggy frosty afternoon i was standing at the door for a moment full of sad thoughts about my father when i saw someone drawing slowly near along the road he was plainly blind for he tapped before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and nose and he was hunched as if with age or weakness and wore a huge old tattered seacloak with a hood that made him appear positively deformed i never saw in my life a more dreadfullooking figure he stopped a little from the inn and raising his voice in an odd singsong addressed the air in front of him will any kind friend inform a poor blind man who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defence of his native country england and god bless king george where or in what part of this country he may now be  you are at the admiral benbow black hill cove my good man said i  i hear a voice said he a young voice will you give me your hand my kind young friend and lead me in  i held out my hand and the horrible softspoken eyeless creature gripped it in a moment like a vise i was so much startled that i struggled to withdraw but the blind man pulled me close up to him with a single action of his arm  now boy he said take me in to the captain  sir said i upon my word i dare not  oh he sneered thats it take me in straight or ill break your arm  and he gave it as he spoke a wrench that made me cry out  sir said i it is for yourself i mean the captain is not what he used to be he sits with a drawn cutlass another gentleman   come now march interrupted he and i never heard a voice so cruel and cold and ugly as that blind mans it cowed me more than the pain and i began to obey him at once walking straight in at the door and towards the parlour where our sick old buccaneer was sitting dazed with rum the blind man clung close to me holding me in one iron fist and leaning almost more of his weight on me than i could carry lead me straight up to him and when im in view cry out heres a friend for you bill if you dont ill do this and with that he gave me a twitch that i thought would have made me faint between this and that i was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that i forgot my terror of the captain and as i opened the parlour door cried out the words he had ordered in a trembling voice  the poor captain raised his eyes and at one look the rum went out of him and left him staring sober the expression of his face was not so much of terror as of mortal sickness he made a movement to rise but i do not believe he had enough force left in his body  now bill sit where you are said the beggar if i cant see i can hear a finger stirring business is business hold out your left hand boy take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right  we both obeyed him to the letter and i saw him pass something from the hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captains which closed upon it instantly  and now thats done said the blind man and at the words he suddenly left hold of me and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness skipped out of the parlour and into the road where as i still stood motionless i could hear his stick go taptaptapping into the distance  it was some time before either i or the captain seemed to gather our senses but at length and about at the same moment i released his wrist which i was still holding and he drew in his hand and looked sharply into the palm  ten oclock he cried six hours well do them yet and he sprang to his feet  even as he did so he reeled put his hand to his throat stood swaying for a moment and then with a peculiar sound fell from his whole height face foremost to the floor  i ran to him at once calling to my mother but haste was all in vain the captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy it is a curious thing to understand for i had certainly never liked the man though of late i had begun to pity him but as soon as i saw that he was dead i burst into a flood of tears it was the second death i had known and the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart     iv the seachest   i lost no time of course in telling my mother all that i knew and perhaps should have told her long before and we saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous position some of the mans money if he had any was certainly due to us but it was not likely that our captains shipmates above all the two specimens seen by me black dog and the blind beggar would be inclined to give up their booty in payment of the dead mans debts the captains order to mount at once and ride for doctor livesey would have left my mother alone and unprotected which was not to be thought of indeed it seemed impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house the fall of coals in the kitchen grate the very ticking of the clock filled us with alarms the neighbourhood to our ears seemed haunted by approaching footsteps and what between the dead body of the captain on the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar hovering near at hand and ready to return there were moments when as the saying goes i jumped in my skin for terror something must speedily be resolved upon and it occurred to us at last to go forth together and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet no sooner said than done bareheaded as we were we ran out at once in the gathering evening and the frosty fog  the hamlet lay not many hundred yards away though out of view on the other side of the next cove and what greatly encouraged me it was in an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had made his appearance and whither he had presumably returned we were not many minutes on the road though we sometimes stopped to lay hold of each other and hearken but there was no unusual sound nothing but the low wash of the ripple and the croaking of the inmates of the wood  it was already candlelight when we reached the hamlet and i shall never forget how much i was cheered to see the yellow shine in doors and windows but that as it proved was the best of the help we were likely to get in that quarter for you would have thought men would have been ashamed of themselves no soul would consent to return with us to the admiral benbow the more we told of our troubles the more man woman and child they clung to the shelter of their houses the name of captain flint though it was strange to me was well enough known to some there and carried a great weight of terror some of the men who had been to fieldwork on the far side of the admiral benbow remembered besides to have seen several strangers on the road and taking them to be smugglers to have bolted away and one at least had seen a little lugger in what we called kitts hole for that matter anyone who was a comrade of the captains was enough to frighten them to death and the short and the long of the matter was that while we could get several who were willing enough to ride to dr liveseys which lay in another direction not one would help us to defend the inn  they say cowardice is infectious but then argument is on the other hand a great emboldener and so when each had said his say my mother made them a speech she would not she declared lose money that belonged to her fatherless boy if none of the rest of you dare  she said jim and i dare back we will go the way we came and small thanks to you big hulking chickenhearted men well have that chest open if we die for it and ill thank you for that bag mrs crossley to bring back our lawful money in  of course i said i would go with my mother and of course they all cried out at our foolhardiness but even then not a man would go along with us all they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were attacked and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were pursued on our return while one lad was to ride forward to the doctors in search of armed assistance  my heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon this dangerous venture a full moon was beginning to rise and peered redly through the upper edges of the fog and this increased our haste for it was plain before we came forth again that all would be as bright as day and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers we slipped along the hedges noiseless and swift nor did we see or hear anything to increase our terrors till to our relief the door of the admiral benbow had closed behind us  i slipped the bolt at once and we stood and panted for a moment in the dark alone in the house with the dead captains body then my mother got a candle in the bar and holding each others hands we advanced into the parlour he lay as we had left him on his back with his eyes open and one arm stretched out  draw down the blind jim whispered my mother they might come and watch outside and now said she when i had done so we have to get the key off that and whos to touch it i should like to know and she gave a kind of sob as she said the words  i went down on my knees at once on the floor close to his hand there was a little round of paper blackened on the one side i could not doubt that this was the black spot and taking it up i found written on the other side in a very good clear hand this short message  you have till ten tonight  he had till ten mother said i and just as i said it our old clock began striking this sudden noise startled us shockingly but the news was good for it was only six  now jim she said that key  i felt in his pockets one after another a few small coins a thimble and some thread and big needles a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end his gully with the crooked handle a pocket compass and a tinder box were all that they contained and i began to despair  perhaps its round his neck suggested my mother  overcoming a strong repugnance i tore open his shirt at the neck and there sure enough hanging to a bit of tarry string which i cut with his own gully we found the key at this triumph we were filled with hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival  it was like any other seamans chest on the outside the initial b  burned on the top of it with a hot iron and the corners somewhat smashed and broken as by long rough usage  give me the key said my mother and though the lock was very stiff she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling  a strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior but nothing was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes carefully brushed and folded they had never been worn my mother said under that the miscellany began a quadrant a tin canikin several sticks of tobacco two brace of very handsome pistols a piece of bar silver an old spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of foreign make a pair of compasses mounted with brass and five or six curious west indian shells i have often wondered since why he should have carried about these shells with him in his wandering guilty and hunted life  in the meantime we had found nothing of any value but the silver and the trinkets and neither of these were in our way underneath there was an old boatcloak whitened with seasalt on many a harbourbar my mother pulled it up with impatience and there lay before us the last things in the chest a bundle tied up in oilcloth and looking like papers and a canvas bag that gave forth at a touch the jingle of gold  ill show these rogues that im an honest woman said my mother ill have my dues and not a farthing over hold mrs crossleys bag and she began to count over the amount of the captains score from the sailors bag into the one that i was holding  it was a long difficult business for the coins were of all countries and sizes doubloons and louis dors and guineas and pieces of eight and i know not what besides all shaken together at random the guineas too were about the scarcest and it was with these only that my mother knew how to make her count  when we were about halfway through i suddenly put my hand upon her arm for i had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my heart into my mouth the taptapping of the blind mans stick upon the frozen road it drew nearer and nearer while we sat holding our breath then it struck sharp on the inn door and then we could hear the handle being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter and then there was a long time of silence both within and without at last the tapping recommenced and to our indescribable joy and gratitude died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard  mother said i take the whole and lets be going for i was sure the bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole hornets nest about our ears though how thankful i was that i had bolted it none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man  but my mother frightened as she was would not consent to take a fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be content with less it was not yet seven she said by a long way she knew her rights and she would have them and she was still arguing with me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill that was enough and more than enough for both of us  ill take what i have she said jumping to her feet  and ill take this to square the count said i picking up the oilskin packet  next moment we were both groping downstairs leaving the candle by the empty chest and the next we had opened the door and were in full retreat we had not started a moment too soon the fog was rapidly dispersing already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on either side and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round the tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the first steps of our escape far less than halfway to the hamlet very little beyond the bottom of the hill we must come forth into the moonlight nor was this all for the sound of several footsteps running came already to our ears and as we looked back in their direction a light tossing to and fro and still rapidly advancing showed that one of the newcomers carried a lantern  my dear said my mother suddenly take the money and run on i am going to faint  this was certainly the end for both of us i thought how i cursed the cowardice of the neighbours how i blamed my poor mother for her honesty and her greed for her past foolhardiness and present weakness we were just at the little bridge by good fortune and i helped her tottering as she was to the edge of the bank where sure enough she gave a sigh and fell on my shoulder i do not know how i found the strength to do it at all and i am afraid it was roughly done but i managed to drag her down the bank and a little way under the arch farther i could not move her for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it so there we had to stay my mother almost entirely exposed and both of us within earshot of the inn     v the last of the blind man   my curiosity in a sense was stronger than my fear for i could not remain where i was but crept back to the bank again whence sheltering my head behind a bush of broom i might command the road before our door i was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive seven or eight of them running hard their feet beating out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front three men ran together hand in hand and i made out even through the mist that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar the next moment his voice showed me that i was right  down with the door he cried  aye aye sir answered two or three and a rush was made upon the admiral benbow the lanternbearer following and then i could see them pause and hear speeches passed in a lower key as if they were surprised to find the door open but the pause was brief for the blind man again issued his commands his voice sounded louder and higher as if he were afire with eagerness and rage  in in in he shouted and cursed them for their delay  four or five of them obeyed at once two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar there was a pause then a cry of surprise and then a voice shouting from the house bills dead  but the blind man swore at them again for their delay  search him some of you shirking lubbers and the rest of you aloft and get the chest he cried  i could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs so that the house must have shook with it promptly afterwards fresh sounds of astonishment arose the window of the captains room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass and a man leaned out into the moonlight head and shoulders and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him  pew he cried theyve been before us someones turned the chest out alow and aloft  is it there roared pew  the moneys there  the blind man cursed the money  flints fist i mean he cried  we dont see it here nohow returned the man  here you below there is it on bill cried the blind man again  at that another fellow probably him who had remained below to search the captains body came to the door of the inn bills been overhauled aready said he nothin left  its these people of the inn its that boy i wish i had put his eyes out cried the blind man pew there were no time ago they had the door bolted when i tried it scatter lads and find em  sure enough they left their glim here said the fellow from the window  scatter and find em rout the house out reiterated pew striking with his stick upon the road  then there followed a great todo through all our old inn heavy feet pounding to and fro furniture thrown over doors kicked in until the very rocks reechoed and the men came out again one after another on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found and just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captains money was once more clearly audible through the night but this time twice repeated i had thought it to be the blind mans trumpet so to speak summoning his crew to the assault but i now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet and from its effect upon the buccaneers a signal to warn them of approaching danger  theres dirk again said one twice well have to budge mates  budge you skulk cried pew dirk was a fool and a coward from the first you wouldnt mind him they must be close by they cant be far you have your hands on it scatter and look for them dogs oh shiver my soul he cried if i had eyes  this appeal seemed to produce some effect for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber but halfheartedly i thought and with half an eye to their own danger all the time while the rest stood irresolute on the road  you have your hands on thousands you fools and you hang a leg youd be as rich as kings if you could find it and you know its here and you stand there skulking there wasnt one of you dared face bill and i did it a blind man and im to lose my chance for you im to be a poor crawling beggar sponging for rum when i might be rolling in a coach if you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still  hang it pew weve got the doubloons grumbled one  they might have hid the blessed thing said another take the georges pew and dont stand here squalling  squalling was the word for it pews anger rose so high at these objections till at last his passion completely taking the upper hand he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one  these in their turn cursed back at the blind miscreant threatened him in horrid terms and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp  this quarrel was the saving of us for while it was still raging another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet the tramp of horses galloping almost at the same time a pistolshot flash and report came from the hedge side and that was plainly the last signal of danger for the buccaneers turned at once and ran separating in every direction one seaward along the cove one slant across the hill and so on so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but pew him they had deserted whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows i know not but there he remained behind tapping up and down the road in a frenzy and groping and calling for his comrades finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me towards the hamlet crying johnny black dog dirk  and other names you wont leave old pew mates not old pew  just then the noise of horses topped the rise and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope  at this pew saw his error turned with a scream and ran straight for the ditch into which he rolled but he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash now utterly bewildered right under the nearest of the coming horses  the rider tried to save him but in vain down went pew with a cry that rang high into the night and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by he fell on his side then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more  i leaped to my feet and hailed the riders they were pulling up at any rate horrified at the accident and i soon saw what they were one tailing out behind the rest was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to dr liveseys the rest were revenue officers whom he had met by the way and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once some news of the lugger in kitts hole had found its way to supervisor dance and set him forth that night in our direction and to that circumstance my mother and i owed our preservation from death  pew was dead stone dead as for my mother when we had carried her up to the hamlet a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again and she was none the worse for her terror though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money in the meantime the supervisor rode on as fast as he could to kitts hole but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle leading and sometimes supporting their horses and in continual fear of ambushes so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the hole the lugger was already under way though still close in he hailed her a voice replied telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm soon after the lugger doubled the point and disappeared mr dance stood there as he said like a fish out of water and all he could do was to dispatch a man to b   to warn the cutter and that said he is just about as good as nothing theyve got off clean and theres an end only he added im glad i trod on master pews corns for by this time he had heard my story  i went back with him to the admiral benbow and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captains moneybag and a little silver from the till i could see at once that we were ruined mr dance could make nothing of the scene  they got the money you say well then hawkins what in fortune were they after more money i suppose  no sir not money i think replied i in fact sir i believe i have the thing in my breast pocket and to tell you the truth i should like to get it put in safety  to be sure boy quite right said he ill take it if you like  i thought perhaps dr livesey  i began  perfectly right he interrupted very cheerily perfectly right a gentleman and a magistrate and now i come to think of it i might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire master pews dead when alls done not that i regret it but hes dead you see and people will make it out against an officer of his majestys revenue if make it out they can now ill tell you hawkins if you like ill take you along  i thanked him heartily for the offer and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were by the time i had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle  dogger said mr dance you have a good horse take up this lad behind you  as soon as i was mounted holding on to doggers belt the supervisor gave the word and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to dr liveseys house     vi the captains papers   we rode hard all the way till we drew up before dr liveseys door the house was all dark to the front  mr dance told me to jump down and knock and dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by the door was opened almost at once by the maid  is dr livesey in i asked  no she said he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire  so there we go boys said mr dance  this time as the distance was short i did not mount but ran with doggers stirrupleather to the lodge gates and up the long leafless moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens here mr dance dismounted and taking me along with him was admitted at a word into the house  the servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them where the squire and dr livesey sat pipe in hand on either side of a bright fire  i had never seen the squire so near at hand he was a tall man over six feet high and broad in proportion and he had a bluff roughandready face all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels his eyebrows were very black and moved readily and this gave him a look of some temper not bad you would say but quick and high  come in mr dance says he very stately and condescending  good evening dance says the doctor with a nod and good evening to you friend jim what good wind brings you here  the supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest when they heard how my mother went back to the inn dr livesey fairly slapped his thigh and the squire cried bravo and broke his long pipe against the grate long before it was done mr trelawney that you will remember was the squires name had got up from his seat and was striding about the room and the doctor as if to hear the better had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own closecropped black poll  at last mr dance finished the story  mr dance said the squire you are a very noble fellow and as for riding down that black atrocious miscreant i regard it as an act of virtue sir like stamping on a cockroach this lad hawkins is a trump i perceive hawkins will you ring that bell mr dance must have some ale  and so jim said the doctor you have the thing that they were after have you  here it is sir said i and gave him the oilskin packet  the doctor looked it all over as if his fingers were itching to open it but instead of doing that he put it quietly in the pocket of his coat  squire said he when dance has had his ale he must of course be off on his majestys service but i mean to keep jim hawkins here to sleep at my house and with your permission i propose we should have up the cold pie and let him sup  as you will livesey said the squire hawkins has earned better than cold pie  so a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable and i made a hearty supper for i was as hungry as a hawk while mr dance was further complimented and at last dismissed  and now squire said the doctor  and now livesey said the squire in the same breath  one at a time one at a time laughed dr livesey you have heard of this flint i suppose  heard of him cried the squire heard of him you say he was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed blackbeard was a child to flint the spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that i tell you sir i was sometimes proud he was an englishman ive seen his topsails with these eyes off trinidad and the cowardly son of a rumpuncheon that i sailed with put back put back sir into port of spain  well ive heard of him myself in england said the doctor but the point is had he money  money cried the squire have you heard the story what were these villains after but money what do they care for but money for what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money  that we shall soon know replied the doctor but you are so confoundedly hotheaded and exclamatory that i cannot get a word in what i want to know is this  supposing that i have here in my pocket some clue to where flint buried his treasure will that treasure amount to much  amount sir cried the squire it will amount to this  if we have the clue you talk about i fit out a ship in bristol dock and take you and hawkins here along and ill have that treasure if i search a year  very well said the doctor now then if jim is agreeable well open the packet and he laid it before him on the table  the bundle was sewn together and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors it contained two things a book and a sealed paper  first of all well try the book observed the doctor  the squire and i were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it for dr livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the sidetable where i had been eating to enjoy the sport of the search on the first page there were only some scraps of writing such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice one was the same as the tattoo mark billy bones his fancy then there was mr w bones mate no more rum off palm key he got itt and some other snatches mostly single words and unintelligible i could not help wondering who it was that had got itt and what itt was that he got a knife in his back as like as not  not much instruction there said dr livesey as he passed on  the next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries there was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money as in common accountbooks but instead of explanatory writing only a varying number of crosses between the two on the 12th of june 1745 for instance a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause in a few cases to be sure the name of a place would be added as offe caraccas or a mere entry of latitude and longitude as 62o 17′ 20″ 19o 2′ 40″  the record lasted over nearly twenty years the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions and these words appended bones his pile  i cant make head or tail of this said dr livesey  the thing is as clear as noonday cried the squire this is the blackhearted hounds accountbook these crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered the sums are the scoundrels share and where he feared an ambiguity you see he added something clearer offe caraccas now you see here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast god help the poor souls that manned her coral long ago  right said the doctor see what it is to be a traveller right and the amounts increase you see as he rose in rank  there was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing french english and spanish moneys to a common value  thrifty man cried the doctor he wasnt the one to be cheated  and now said the squire for the other  the paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal the very thimble perhaps that i had found in the captains pocket the doctor opened the seals with great care and there fell out the map of an island with latitude and longitude soundings names of hills and bays and inlets and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores it was about nine miles long and five across shaped you might say like a fat dragon standing up and had two fine landlocked harbours and a hill in the centre part marked the spyglass there were several additions of a later date but above all three crosses of red ink two on the north part of the island one in the southwest and beside this last in the same red ink and in a small neat hand very different from the captains tottery characters these words  bulk of treasure here  over on the back the same hand had written this further information        tall tree spyglass shoulder bearing a point to      the n of nne       skeleton island ese and by e       ten feet       the bar silver is in the north cache you can find      it by the trend of the east hummock ten fathoms      south of the black crag with the face on it       the arms are easy found in the sandhill n      point of north inlet cape bearing e and a      quarter n      jf  that was all but brief as it was and to me incomprehensible it filled the squire and dr livesey with delight  livesey said the squire you will give up this wretched practice at once tomorrow i start for bristol in three weeks time three weeks two weeks ten days well have the best ship sir and the choicest crew in england hawkins shall come as cabinboy youll make a famous cabinboy hawkins you livesey are ships doctor i am admiral well take redruth joyce and hunter well have favourable winds a quick passage and not the least difficulty in finding the spot and money to eat to roll in to play duck and drake with ever after  trelawney said the doctor ill go with you and ill go bail for it so will jim and be a credit to the undertaking theres only one man im afraid of  and whos that cried the squire name the dog sir  you replied the doctor for you cannot hold your tongue we are not the only men who know of this paper these fellows who attacked the inn tonight bold desperate blades for sure and the rest who stayed aboard that lugger and more i dare say not far off are one and all through thick and thin bound that theyll get that money we must none of us go alone till we get to sea jim and i shall stick together in the meanwhile youll take joyce and hunter when you ride to bristol and from first to last not one of us must breathe a word of what weve found  livesey returned the squire you are always in the right of it ill be as silent as the grave     part two the seacook     vii i go to bristol   it was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea and none of our first plans not even dr liveseys of keeping me beside him could be carried out as we intended the doctor had to go to london for a physician to take charge of his practice the squire was hard at work at bristol and i lived on at the hall under the charge of old redruth the gamekeeper almost a prisoner but full of seadreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures i brooded by the hour together over the map all the details of which i well remembered sitting by the fire in the housekeepers room i approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction i explored every acre of its surface i climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the spyglass and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects sometimes the isle was thick with savages with whom we fought sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures  so the weeks passed on till one fine day there came a letter addressed to dr livesey with this addition to be opened in the case of his absence by tom redruth or young hawkins obeying this order we found or rather i found for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print the following important news        old anchor inn bristol march 1 17        dear livesey as i do not know whether you      are at the hall or still in london i send this in      double to both places       the ship is bought and fitted  she lies at      anchor ready for sea  you never imagined a      sweeter schooner a child might sail her two      hundred tons name hispaniola       i got her through my old friend blandly who      has proved himself throughout the most surprising      trump  the admirable fellow literally slaved in      my interest and so i may say did everyone in      bristol as soon as they got wind of the port we      sailed for treasure i mean  redruth said i interrupting the letter dr livesey will not like that the squire has been talking after all  well whos a better right growled the gamekeeper a pretty rum go if squire aint to talk for dr livesey i should think  at that i gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on        blandly himself found the hispaniola and      by the most admirable management got her for the      merest trifle  there is a class of men in bristol      monstrously prejudiced against blandly  they go      the length of declaring that this honest creature      would do anything for money that the hispaniola      belonged to him and that he sold it me absurdly      high the most transparent calumnies  none of them      dare however to deny the merits of the ship       so far there was not a hitch  the      workpeople to be sure riggers and what not were      most annoyingly slow but time cured that  it was      the crew that troubled me       i wished a round score of men in case of      natives buccaneers or the odious french and i      had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much      as half a dozen till the most remarkable stroke      of fortune brought me the very man that i      required       i was standing on the dock when by the      merest accident i fell in talk with him  i found      he was an old sailor kept a publichouse knew      all the seafaring men in bristol had lost his      health ashore and wanted a good berth as cook to      get to sea again  he had hobbled down there that      morning he said to get a smell of the salt       i was monstrously touched so would you have      been and out of pure pity i engaged him on the      spot to be ships cook  long john silver he is      called and has lost a leg but that i regarded as      a recommendation since he lost it in his      countrys service under the immortal hawke  he      has no pension livesey  imagine the abominable      age we live in       well sir i thought i had only found a cook      but it was a crew i had discovered  between      silver and myself we got together in a few days a      company of the toughest old salts imaginable not      pretty to look at but fellows by their faces of      the most indomitable spirit  i declare we could      fight a frigate       long john even got rid of two out of the six      or seven i had already engaged  he showed me in a      moment that they were just the sort of freshwater      swabs we had to fear in an adventure of      importance       i am in the most magnificent health and      spirits eating like a bull sleeping like a tree      yet i shall not enjoy a moment till i hear my old      tarpaulins tramping round the capstan  seaward      ho  hang the treasure  its the glory of the sea      that has turned my head  so now livesey come      post do not lose an hour if you respect me       let young hawkins go at once to see his      mother with redruth for a guard and then both      come full speed to bristol      john trelawney       postscript i did not tell you that blandly      who by the way is to send a consort after us if      we dont turn up by the end of august had found      an admirable fellow for sailing master a stiff      man which i regret but in all other respects a      treasure  long john silver unearthed a very      competent man for a mate a man named arrow  i      have a boatswain who pipes livesey so things      shall go manowar fashion on board the good ship      hispaniola       i forgot to tell you that silver is a man of      substance i know of my own knowledge that he has      a bankers account which has never been      overdrawn  he leaves his wife to manage the inn      and as she is a woman of colour a pair of old      bachelors like you and i may be excused for      guessing that it is the wife quite as much as the      health that sends him back to roving      j t       pps hawkins may stay one night with his      mother      j t  you can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me i was half beside myself with glee and if ever i despised a man it was old tom redruth who could do nothing but grumble and lament any of the undergamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him but such was not the squires pleasure and the squires pleasure was like law among them all nobody but old redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble  the next morning he and i set out on foot for the admiral benbow and there i found my mother in good health and spirits the captain who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort was gone where the wicked cease from troubling the squire had had everything repaired and the public rooms and the sign repainted and had added some furniture above all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar he had found her a boy as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while i was gone  it was on seeing that boy that i understood for the first time my situation i had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me not at all of the home that i was leaving and now at sight of this clumsy stranger who was to stay here in my place beside my mother i had my first attack of tears i am afraid i led that boy a dogs life for as he was new to the work i had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down and i was not slow to profit by them  the night passed and the next day after dinner redruth and i were afoot again and on the road i said goodbye to mother and the cove where i had lived since i was born and the dear old admiral benbow since he was repainted no longer quite so dear one of my last thoughts was of the captain who had so often strode along the beach with his cocked hat his sabrecut cheek and his old brass telescope next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight  the mail picked us up about dusk at the royal george on the heath i was wedged in between redruth and a stout old gentleman and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air i must have dozed a great deal from the very first and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage for when i was awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs and i opened my eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in a city street and that the day had already broken a long time  where are we i asked  bristol said tom get down  mr trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to superintend the work upon the schooner thither we had now to walk and our way to my great delight lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations in one sailors were singing at their work in another there were men aloft high over my head hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spiders though i had lived by the shore all my life i seemed never to have been near the sea till then the smell of tar and salt was something new i saw the most wonderful figureheads that had all been far over the ocean i saw besides many old sailors with rings in their ears and whiskers curled in ringlets and tarry pigtails and their swaggering clumsy seawalk and if i had seen as many kings or archbishops i could not have been more delighted  and i was going to sea myself to sea in a schooner with a piping boatswain and pigtailed singing seamen to sea bound for an unknown island and to seek for buried treasure  while i was still in this delightful dream we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met squire trelawney all dressed out like a seaofficer in stout blue cloth coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailors walk  here you are he cried and the doctor came last night from london bravo the ships company complete  oh sir cried i when do we sail  sail says he we sail tomorrow     viii at the sign of the spyglass   when i had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to john silver at the sign of the spyglass and told me i should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign i set off overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and seamen and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and bales for the dock was now at its busiest until i found the tavern in question  it was a bright enough little place of entertainment the sign was newly painted the windows had neat red curtains the floor was cleanly sanded there was a street on each side and an open door on both which made the large low room pretty clear to see in in spite of clouds of tobacco smoke  the customers were mostly seafaring men and they talked so loudly that i hung at the door almost afraid to enter  as i was waiting a man came out of a side room and at a glance i was sure he must be long john his left leg was cut off close by the hip and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch which he managed with wonderful dexterity hopping about upon it like a bird he was very tall and strong with a face as big as a ham plain and pale but intelligent and smiling indeed he seemed in the most cheerful spirits whistling as he moved about among the tables with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guests  now to tell you the truth from the very first mention of long john in squire trelawneys letter i had taken a fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very onelegged sailor whom i had watched for so long at the old benbow but one look at the man before me was enough i had seen the captain and black dog and the blind man pew and i thought i knew what a buccaneer was like a very different creature according to me from this clean and pleasanttempered landlord  i plucked up courage at once crossed the threshold and walked right up to the man where he stood propped on his crutch talking to a customer  mr silver sir i asked holding out the note  yes my lad said he such is my name to be sure and who may you be and then as he saw the squires letter he seemed to me to give something almost like a start  oh said he quite loud and offering his hand i see you are our new cabinboy pleased i am to see you  and he took my hand in his large firm grasp  just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door it was close by him and he was out in the street in a moment but his hurry had attracted my notice and i recognized him at glance it was the tallowfaced man wanting two fingers who had come first to the admiral benbow  oh i cried stop him its black dog  i dont care two coppers who he is cried silver but he hasnt paid his score harry run and catch him  one of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit  if he were admiral hawke he shall pay his score cried silver and then relinquishing my hand who did you say he was he asked black what  dog sir said i has mr trelawney not told you of the buccaneers he was one of them  so cried silver in my house ben run and help harry one of those swabs was he was that you drinking with him morgan step up here  the man whom he called morgan an old greyhaired mahoganyfaced sailor came forward pretty sheepishly rolling his quid  now morgan said long john very sternly you never clapped your eyes on that black black dog before did you now  not i sir said morgan with a salute  you didnt know his name did you  no sir  by the powers tom morgan its as good for you exclaimed the landlord if you had been mixed up with the like of that you would never have put another foot in my house you may lay to that and what was he saying to you  i dont rightly know sir answered morgan  do you call that a head on your shoulders or a blessed deadeye  cried long john dont rightly know dont you perhaps you dont happen to rightly know who you was speaking to perhaps come now what was he jawing vyages capns ships pipe up what was it  we was atalkin of keelhauling answered morgan  keelhauling was you and a mighty suitable thing too and you may lay to that get back to your place for a lubber tom  and then as morgan rolled back to his seat silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering as i thought hes quite an honest man tom morgan ony stupid and now he ran on again aloud lets see black dog no i dont know the name not i yet i kind of think ive yes ive seen the swab he used to come here with a blind beggar he used  that he did you may be sure said i i knew that blind man too his name was pew  it was cried silver now quite excited pew that were his name for certain ah he looked a shark he did if we run down this black dog now therell be news for capn trelawney bens a good runner few seamen run better than ben he should run him down hand over hand by the powers he talked o keelhauling did he ill keelhaul him  all the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch slapping tables with his hand and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an old bailey judge or a bow street runner my suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding black dog at the spyglass and i watched the cook narrowly but he was too deep and too ready and too clever for me and by the time the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd and been scolded like thieves i would have gone bail for the innocence of long john silver  see here now hawkins said he heres a blessed hard thing on a man like me now aint it theres capn trelawney whats he to think here i have this confounded son of a dutchman sitting in my own house drinking of my own rum here you comes and tells me of it plain and here i let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights now hawkins you do me justice with the capn youre a lad you are but youre as smart as paint i see that when you first come in now here it is  what could i do with this old timber i hobble on when i was an a b master mariner id have come up alongside of him hand over hand and broached him to in a brace of old shakes i would but now   and then all of a sudden he stopped and his jaw dropped as though he had remembered something  the score he burst out three goes o rum why shiver my timbers if i hadnt forgotten my score  and falling on a bench he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks i could not help joining and we laughed together peal after peal until the tavern rang again  why what a precious old seacalf i am he said at last wiping his cheeks you and me should get on well hawkins for ill take my davy i should be rated ships boy but come now stand by to go about this wont do dooty is dooty messmates ill put on my old cockerel hat and step along of you to capn trelawney and report this here affair for mind you its serious young hawkins and neither you nor mes come out of it with what i should make so bold as to call credit nor you neither says you not smart none of the pair of us smart but dash my buttons that was a good un about my score  and he began to laugh again and that so heartily that though i did not see the joke as he did i was again obliged to join him in his mirth  on our little walk along the quays he made himself the most interesting companion telling me about the different ships that we passed by their rig tonnage and nationality explaining the work that was going forward how one was discharging another taking in cargo and a third making ready for sea and every now and then telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till i had learned it perfectly i began to see that here was one of the best of possible shipmates  when we got to the inn the squire and dr livesey were seated together finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection  long john told the story from first to last with a great deal of spirit and the most perfect truth that was how it were now werent it hawkins he would say now and again and i could always bear him entirely out  the two gentlemen regretted that black dog had got away but we all agreed there was nothing to be done and after he had been complimented long john took up his crutch and departed  all hands aboard by four this afternoon shouted the squire after him  aye aye sir cried the cook in the passage  well squire said dr livesey i dont put much faith in your discoveries as a general thing but i will say this john silver suits me  the mans a perfect trump declared the squire  and now added the doctor jim may come on board with us may he not  to be sure he may says squire take your hat hawkins and well see the ship     ix powder and arms   the hispaniola lay some way out and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel and sometimes swung above us at last however we got alongside and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate mr arrow a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint he and the squire were very thick and friendly but i soon observed that things were not the same between mr trelawney and the captain  this last was a sharplooking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us  captain smollett sir axing to speak with you said he  i am always at the captains orders show him in said the squire  the captain who was close behind his messenger entered at once and shut the door behind him  well captain smollett what have you to say all well i hope all shipshape and seaworthy  well sir said the captain better speak plain i believe even at the risk of offence i dont like this cruise i dont like the men and i dont like my officer thats short and sweet  perhaps sir you dont like the ship inquired the squire very angry as i could see  i cant speak as to that sir not having seen her tried said the captain she seems a clever craft more i cant say  possibly sir you may not like your employer either says the squire  but here dr livesey cut in  stay a bit said he stay a bit no use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling the captain has said too much or he has said too little and im bound to say that i require an explanation of his words you dont you say like this cruise now why  i was engaged sir on what we call sealed orders to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me said the captain so far so good but now i find that every man before the mast knows more than i do i dont call that fair now do you  no said dr livesey i dont  next said the captain i learn we are going after treasure hear it from my own hands mind you now treasure is ticklish work i dont like treasure voyages on any account and i dont like them above all when they are secret and when begging your pardon mr trelawney the secret has been told to the parrot  silvers parrot asked the squire  its a way of speaking said the captain blabbed i mean its my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about but ill tell you my way of it life or death and a close run  that is all clear and i dare say true enough replied dr livesey we take the risk but we are not so ignorant as you believe us next you say you dont like the crew are they not good seamen  i dont like them sir returned captain smollett and i think i should have had the choosing of my own hands if you go to that  perhaps you should replied the doctor my friend should perhaps have taken you along with him but the slight if there be one was unintentional and you dont like mr arrow  i dont sir i believe hes a good seaman but hes too free with the crew to be a good officer a mate should keep himself to himself shouldnt drink with the men before the mast  do you mean he drinks cried the squire  no sir replied the captain only that hes too familiar  well now and the short and long of it captain asked the doctor tell us what you want  well gentlemen are you determined to go on this cruise  like iron answered the squire  very good said the captain then as youve heard me very patiently saying things that i could not prove hear me a few words more they are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold now you have a good place under the cabin why not put them there first point then you are bringing four of your own people with you and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward why not give them the berths here beside the cabin second point  any more asked mr trelawney  one more said the captain theres been too much blabbing already  far too much agreed the doctor  ill tell you what ive heard myself continued captain smollett  that you have a map of an island that theres crosses on the map to show where treasure is and that the island lies  and then he named the latitude and longitude exactly  i never told that cried the squire to a soul  the hands know it sir returned the captain  livesey that must have been you or hawkins cried the squire  it doesnt much matter who it was replied the doctor and i could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to mr trelawneys protestations neither did i to be sure he was so loose a talker yet in this case i believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island  well gentlemen continued the captain i dont know who has this map but i make it a point it shall be kept secret even from me and mr arrow otherwise i would ask you to let me resign  i see said the doctor you wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship manned with my friends own people and provided with all the arms and powder on board in other words you fear a mutiny  sir said captain smollett with no intention to take offence i deny your right to put words into my mouth no captain sir would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that as for mr arrow i believe him thoroughly honest some of the men are the same all may be for what i know but i am responsible for the ships safety and the life of every man jack aboard of her i see things going as i think not quite right and i ask you to take certain precautions or let me resign my berth and thats all  captain smollett began the doctor with a smile did ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse youll excuse me i dare say but you remind me of that fable when you came in here ill stake my wig you meant more than this  doctor said the captain you are smart when i came in here i meant to get discharged i had no thought that mr trelawney would hear a word  no more i would cried the squire had livesey not been here i should have seen you to the deuce as it is i have heard you i will do as you desire but i think the worse of you  thats as you please sir said the captain youll find i do my duty  and with that he took his leave  trelawney said the doctor contrary to all my notions i believed you have managed to get two honest men on board with you that man and john silver  silver if you like cried the squire but as for that intolerable humbug i declare i think his conduct unmanly unsailorly and downright unenglish  well says the doctor we shall see  when we came on deck the men had begun already to take out the arms and powder yohoing at their work while the captain and mr arrow stood by superintending  the new arrangement was quite to my liking the whole schooner had been overhauled six berths had been made astern out of what had been the afterpart of the main hold and this set of cabins was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side it had been originally meant that the captain mr arrow hunter joyce the doctor and the squire were to occupy these six berths now redruth and i were to get two of them and mr arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion which had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it a roundhouse very low it was still of course but there was room to swing two hammocks and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement even he perhaps had been doubtful as to the crew but that is only guess for as you shall hear we had not long the benefit of his opinion  we were all hard at work changing the powder and the berths when the last man or two and long john along with them came off in a shoreboat  the cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness and as soon as he saw what was doing so ho mates says he whats this  were achanging of the powder jack answers one  why by the powers cried long john if we do well miss the morning tide  my orders said the captain shortly you may go below my man hands will want supper  aye aye sir answered the cook and touching his forelock he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley  thats a good man captain said the doctor  very likely sir replied captain smollett easy with that men easy he ran on to the fellows who were shifting the powder and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships a long brass nine here you ships boy he cried out o that off with you to the cook and get some work  and then as i was hurrying off i heard him say quite loudly to the doctor ill have no favourites on my ship  i assure you i was quite of the squires way of thinking and hated the captain deeply     x the voyage   all that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place and boatfuls of the squires friends mr blandly and the like coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return we never had a night at the admiral benbow when i had half the work and i was dogtired when a little before dawn the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstanbars i might have been twice as weary yet i would not have left the deck all was so new and interesting to me the brief commands the shrill note of the whistle the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ships lanterns  now barbecue tip us a stave cried one voice  the old one cried another  aye aye mates said long john who was standing by with his crutch under his arm and at once broke out in the air and words i knew so well   fifteen men on the dead mans chest   and then the whole crew bore chorus    yohoho and a bottle of rum  and at the third ho drove the bars before them with a will  even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old admiral benbow in a second and i seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus but soon the anchor was short up soon it was hanging dripping at the bows soon the sails began to draw and the land and shipping to flit by on either side and before i could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the hispaniola had begun her voyage to the isle of treasure  i am not going to relate that voyage in detail it was fairly prosperous the ship proved to be a good ship the crew were capable seamen and the captain thoroughly understood his business but before we came the length of treasure island two or three things had happened which require to be known  mr arrow first of all turned out even worse than the captain had feared he had no command among the men and people did what they pleased with him but that was by no means the worst of it for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye red cheeks stuttering tongue and other marks of drunkenness time after time he was ordered below in disgrace sometimes he fell and cut himself sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably  in the meantime we could never make out where he got the drink that was the ships mystery watch him as we pleased we could do nothing to solve it and when we asked him to his face he would only laugh if he were drunk and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water  he was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright so nobody was much surprised nor very sorry when one dark night with a head sea he disappeared entirely and was seen no more  overboard said the captain well gentlemen that saves the trouble of putting him in irons  but there we were without a mate and it was necessary of course to advance one of the men the boatswain job anderson was the likeliest man aboard and though he kept his old title he served in a way as mate mr trelawney had followed the sea and his knowledge made him very useful for he often took a watch himself in easy weather and the coxswain israel hands was a careful wily old experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything  he was a great confidant of long john silver and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ships cook barbecue as the men called him  aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck to have both hands as free as possible it was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead and propped against it yielding to every movement of the ship get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck he had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaces long johns earrings they were called and he would hand himself from one place to another now using the crutch now trailing it alongside by the lanyard as quickly as another man could walk yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced  hes no common man barbecue said the coxswain to me he had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded and brave a lions nothing alongside of long john i seen him grapple four and knock their heads together him unarmed  all the crew respected and even obeyed him he had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service to me he was unweariedly kind and always glad to see me in the galley which he kept as clean as a new pin the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner  come away hawkins he would say come and have a yarn with john nobody more welcome than yourself my son sit you down and hear the news heres capn flint i calls my parrot capn flint after the famous buccaneer heres capn flint predicting success to our vyage wasnt you capn  and the parrot would say with great rapidity pieces of eight pieces of eight pieces of eight till you wondered that it was not out of breath or till john threw his handkerchief over the cage  now that bird he would say is maybe two hundred years old hawkins they live forever mostly and if anybodys seen more wickedness it must be the devil himself shes sailed with england the great capn england the pirate shes been at madagascar and at malabar and surinam and providence and portobello she was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships its there she learned pieces of eight and little wonder three hundred and fifty thousand of em hawkins she was at the boarding of the viceroy of the indies out of goa she was and to look at her you would think she was a babby but you smelt powder didnt you capn  stand by to go about the parrot would scream  ah shes a handsome craft she is the cook would say and give her sugar from his pocket and then the bird would peck at the bars and swear straight on passing belief for wickedness there john would add you cant touch pitch and not be mucked lad heres this poor old innocent bird o mine swearing blue fire and none the wiser you may lay to that she would swear the same in a manner of speaking before chaplain and john would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had that made me think he was the best of men  in the meantime the squire and captain smollett were still on pretty distant terms with one another the squire made no bones about the matter he despised the captain the captain on his part never spoke but when he was spoken to and then sharp and short and dry and not a word wasted he owned when driven into a corner that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well as for the ship he had taken a downright fancy to her shell lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife sir but he would add all i say is were not home again and i dont like the cruise  the squire at this would turn away and march up and down the deck chin in air  a trifle more of that man he would say and i shall explode  we had some heavy weather which only proved the qualities of the hispaniola every man on board seemed well content and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise for it is my belief there was never a ships company so spoiled since noah put to sea double grog was going on the least excuse there was duff on odd days as for instance if the squire heard it was any mans birthday and always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy  never knew good come of it yet the captain said to dr livesey spoil forecastle hands make devils thats my belief  but good did come of the apple barrel as you shall hear for if it had not been for that we should have had no note of warning and might all have perished by the hand of treachery  this was how it came about  we had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after i am not allowed to be more plain and now we were running down for it with a bright lookout day and night it was about the last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation some time that night or at latest before noon of the morrow we should sight the treasure island we were heading ssw and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea the hispaniola rolled steadily dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray all was drawing alow and aloft everyone was in the bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure  now just after sundown when all my work was over and i was on my way to my berth it occurred to me that i should like an apple i ran on deck the watch was all forward looking out for the island the man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently to himself and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of the ship  in i got bodily into the apple barrel and found there was scarce an apple left but sitting down there in the dark what with the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship i had either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with rather a clash close by the barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders against it and i was just about to jump up when the man began to speak it was silvers voice and before i had heard a dozen words i would not have shown myself for all the world but lay there trembling and listening in the extreme of fear and curiosity for from these dozen words i understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone     xi what i heard in the applebarrel   no not i said silver flint was capn i was quartermaster along of my timber leg the same broadside i lost my leg old pew lost his deadlights it was a master surgeon him that ampytated me out of college and all latin by the bucket and what not but he was hanged like a dog and sundried like the rest at corso castle that was roberts men that was and comed of changing names to their ships royal fortune and so on now what a ship was christened so let her stay i says so it was with the cassandra as brought us all safe home from malabar after england took the viceroy of the indies so it was with the old walrus flints old ship as ive seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold  ah cried another voice that of the youngest hand on board and evidently full of admiration he was the flower of the flock was flint  davis was a man too by all accounts said silver i never sailed along of him first with england then with flint thats my story and now here on my own account in a manner of speaking i laid by nine hundred safe from england and two thousand after flint that aint bad for a man before the mast all safe in bank taint earning now its saving does it you may lay to that wheres all englands men now i dunno wheres flints why most on em aboard here and glad to get the duff been begging before that some on em old pew as had lost his sight and might have thought shame spends twelve hundred pound in a year like a lord in parliament where is he now well hes dead now and under hatches but for two year before that shiver my timbers the man was starving he begged and he stole and he cut throats and starved at that by the powers  well it aint much use after all said the young seaman  taint much use for fools you may lay to it that nor nothing  cried silver but now you look here  youre young you are but youre as smart as paint i see that when i set my eyes on you and ill talk to you like a man  you may imagine how i felt when i heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself i think if i had been able that i would have killed him through the barrel meantime he ran on little supposing he was overheard  here it is about gentlemen of fortune they lives rough and they risk swinging but they eat and drink like fightingcocks and when a cruise is done why its hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets now the most goes for rum and a good fling and to sea again in their shirts but thats not the course i lay i puts it all away some here some there and none too much anywheres by reason of suspicion im fifty mark you once back from this cruise i set up gentleman in earnest time enough too says you ah but ive lived easy in the meantime never denied myself o nothing heart desires and slep soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea and how did i begin before the mast like you  well said the other but all the other moneys gone now aint it you darent show face in bristol after this  why where might you suppose it was asked silver derisively  at bristol in banks and places answered his companion  it were said the cook it were when we weighed anchor but my old missis has it all by now and the spyglass is sold lease and goodwill and rigging and the old girls off to meet me i would tell you where for i trust you but itd make jealousy among the mates  and can you trust your missis asked the other  gentlemen of fortune returned the cook usually trusts little among themselves and right they are you may lay to it but i have a way with me i have when a mate brings a slip on his cable one as knows me i mean it wont be in the same world with old john there was some that was feared of pew and some that was feared of flint but flint his own self was feared of me feared he was and proud they was the roughest crew afloat was flints the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them well now i tell you im not a boasting man and you seen yourself how easy i keep company but when i was quartermaster lambs wasnt the word for flints old buccaneers ah you may be sure of yourself in old johns ship  well i tell you now replied the lad i didnt half a quarter like the job till i had this talk with you john but theres my hand on it now  and a brave lad you were and smart too answered silver shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune i never clapped my eyes on  by this time i had begun to understand the meaning of their terms by a gentleman of fortune they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate and the little scene that i had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands perhaps of the last one left aboard but on this point i was soon to be relieved for silver giving a little whistle a third man strolled up and sat down by the party  dicks square said silver  oh i knowd dick was square returned the voice of the coxswain israel hands hes no fool is dick and he turned

you may fancy the terror i was in i should have leaped out and run for it if i had found the strength but my limbs and heart alike misgave me i heard dick begin to rise and then someone seemingly stopped him and the voice of hands exclaimed oh stow that dont you get sucking of that bilge john lets have a go of the rum  dick said silver i trust you ive a gauge on the keg mind theres the key you fill a pannikin and bring it up  terrified as i was i could not help thinking to myself that this must have been how mr arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him  dick was gone but a little while and during his absence israel spoke straight on in the cooks ear it was but a word or two that i could catch and yet i gathered some important news for besides other scraps that tended to the same purpose this whole clause was audible  not another man of themll jine hence there were still faithful men on board  when dick returned one after another of the trio took the pannikin and drank one to luck another with a heres to old flint and silver himself saying in a kind of song heres to ourselves and hold your luff plenty of prizes and plenty of duff  just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel and looking up i found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzentop and shining white on the luff of the foresail and almost at the same time the voice of the lookout shouted land ho     xii council of war   there was a great rush of feet across the deck i could hear people tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle and slipping in an instant outside my barrel i dived behind the foresail made a double towards the stern and came out upon the open deck in time to join hunter and dr livesey in the rush for the weather bow  there all hands were already congregated a belt of fog had lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon away to the southwest of us we saw two low hills about a couple of miles apart and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill whose peak was still buried in the fog all three seemed sharp and conical in figure  so much i saw almost in a dream for i had not yet recovered from my horrid fear of a minute or two before and then i heard the voice of captain smollett issuing orders the hispaniola was laid a couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the island on the east  and now men said the captain when all was sheeted home has any one of you ever seen that land ahead  i have sir said silver ive watered there with a trader i was cook in  the anchorage is on the south behind an islet i fancy asked the captain  yes sir skeleton island they calls it it were a main place for pirates once and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it that hill to the norard they calls the foremast hill there are three hills in a row running southard fore main and mizzen sir but the main thats the big un with the cloud on it they usually calls the spyglass by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the anchorage cleaning for its there they cleaned their ships sir asking your pardon  i have a chart here says captain smollett see if thats the place  long johns eyes burned in his head as he took the chart but by the fresh look of the paper i knew he was doomed to disappointment this was not the map we found in billy boness chest but an accurate copy complete in all things names and heights and soundings with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes sharp as must have been his annoyance silver had the strength of mind to hide it  yes sir said he this is the spot to be sure and very prettily drawed out who might have done that i wonder the pirates were too ignorant i reckon aye here it is  capt kidds anchorage just the name my shipmate called it theres a strong current runs along the south and then away norard up the west coast right you was sir  says he to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island leastways if such was your intention as to enter and careen and there aint no better place for that in these waters  thank you my man says captain smollett ill ask you later on to give us a help you may go  i was surprised at the coolness with which john avowed his knowledge of the island and i own i was halffrightened when i saw him drawing nearer to myself he did not know to be sure that i had overheard his council from the apple barrel and yet i had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty duplicity and power that i could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm  ah says he this here is a sweet spot this island a sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on youll bathe and youll climb trees and youll hunt goats you will and youll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself why it makes me young again i was going to forget my timber leg i was its a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes and you may lay to that when you want to go a bit of exploring you just ask old john and hell put up a snack for you to take along  and clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder he hobbled off forward and went below  captain smollett the squire and dr livesey were talking together on the quarterdeck and anxious as i was to tell them my story i durst not interrupt them openly while i was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse dr livesey called me to his side he had left his pipe below and being a slave to tobacco had meant that i should fetch it but as soon as i was near enough to speak and not to be overheard i broke immediately doctor let me speak get the captain and squire down to the cabin and then make some pretence to send for me i have terrible news  the doctor changed countenance a little but next moment he was master of himself  thank you jim said he quite loudly that was all i wanted to know  as if he had asked me a question  and with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two they spoke together for a little and though none of them started or raised his voice or so much as whistled it was plain enough that dr livesey had communicated my request for the next thing that i heard was the captain giving an order to job anderson and all hands were piped on deck  my lads said captain smollett ive a word to say to you this land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for mr trelawney being a very openhanded gentleman as we all know has just asked me a word or two and as i was able to tell him that every man on board had done his duty alow and aloft as i never ask to see it done better why he and i and the doctor are going below to the cabin to drink your health and luck and youll have grog served out for you to drink our health and luck ill tell you what i think of this  i think it handsome and if you think as i do youll give a good seacheer for the gentleman that does it  the cheer followed that was a matter of course but it rang out so full and hearty that i confess i could hardly believe these same men were plotting for our blood  one more cheer for capn smollett cried long john when the first had subsided  and this also was given with a will  on the top of that the three gentlemen went below and not long after word was sent forward that jim hawkins was wanted in the cabin  i found them all three seated round the table a bottle of spanish wine and some raisins before them and the doctor smoking away with his wig on his lap and that i knew was a sign that he was agitated the stern window was open for it was a warm night and you could see the moon shining behind on the ships wake  now hawkins said the squire you have something to say speak up  i did as i was bid and as short as i could make it told the whole details of silvers conversation nobody interrupted me till i was done nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last  jim said dr livesey take a seat  and they made me sit down at table beside them poured me out a glass of wine filled my hands with raisins and all three one after the other and each with a bow drank my good health and their service to me for my luck and courage  now captain said the squire you were right and i was wrong i own myself an ass and i await your orders  no more an ass than i sir returned the captain i never heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according but this crew he added beats me  captain said the doctor with your permission thats silver a very remarkable man  hed look remarkably well from a yardarm sir returned the captain but this is talk this dont lead to anything i see three or four points and with mr trelawneys permission ill name them  you sir are the captain it is for you to speak says mr trelawney grandly  first point began mr smollett we must go on because we cant turn back if i gave the word to go about they would rise at once second point we have time before us at least until this treasures found third point there are faithful hands now sir its got to come to blows sooner or later and what i propose is to take time by the forelock as the saying is and come to blows some fine day when they least expect it we can count i take it on your own home servants mr trelawney  as upon myself declared the squire  three reckoned the captain ourselves make seven counting hawkins here now about the honest hands  most likely trelawneys own men said the doctor those he had picked up for himself before he lit on silver  nay replied the squire hands was one of mine  i did think i could have trusted hands added the captain  and to think that theyre all englishmen broke out the squire sir i could find it in my heart to blow the ship up  well gentlemen said the captain the best that i can say is not much we must lay to if you please and keep a bright lookout its trying on a man i know it would be pleasanter to come to blows but theres no help for it till we know our men lay to and whistle for a wind thats my view  jim here said the doctor can help us more than anyone the men are not shy with him and jim is a noticing lad  hawkins i put prodigious faith in you added the squire  i began to feel pretty desperate at this for i felt altogether helpless and yet by an odd train of circumstances it was indeed through me that safety came in the meantime talk as we pleased there were only seven out of the twentysix on whom we knew we could rely and out of these seven one was a boy so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen     part three my shore adventure     xiii how i began my shore adventure   the appearance of the island when i came on deck next morning was altogether changed although the breeze had now utterly ceased we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the southeast of the low eastern coast greycoloured woods covered a large part of the surface this even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sandbreak in the lower lands and by many tall trees of the pine family outtopping the others some singly some in clumps but the general colouring was uniform and sad the hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock all were strangely shaped and the spyglass which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island was likewise the strangest in configuration running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on  the hispaniola was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell the booms were tearing at the blocks the rudder was banging to and fro and the whole ship creaking groaning and jumping like a manufactory i had to cling tight to the backstay and the world turned giddily before my eyes for though i was a good enough sailor when there was way on this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing i never learned to stand without a qualm or so above all in the morning on an empty stomach  perhaps it was this perhaps it was the look of the island with its grey melancholy woods and wild stone spires and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach at least although the sun shone bright and hot and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea my heart sank as the saying is into my boots and from the first look onward i hated the very thought of treasure island  we had a dreary mornings work before us for there was no sign of any wind and the boats had to be got out and manned and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind skeleton island i volunteered for one of the boats where i had of course no business the heat was sweltering and the men grumbled fiercely over their work anderson was in command of my boat and instead of keeping the crew in order he grumbled as loud as the worst  well he said with an oath its not forever  i thought this was a very bad sign for up to that day the men had gone briskly and willingly about their business but the very sight of the island had relaxed the cords of discipline  all the way in long john stood by the steersman and conned the ship he knew the passage like the palm of his hand and though the man in the chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart john never hesitated once  theres a strong scour with the ebb he said and this here passage has been dug out in a manner of speaking with a spade  we brought up just where the anchor was in the chart about a third of a mile from each shore the mainland on one side and skeleton island on the other the bottom was clean sand the plunge of our anchor sent up clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods but in less than a minute they were down again and all was once more silent  the place was entirely landlocked buried in woods the trees coming right down to highwater mark the shores mostly flat and the hilltops standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre one here one there two little rivers or rather two swamps emptied out into this pond as you might call it and the foliage round that part of the shore had a kind of poisonous brightness from the ship we could see nothing of the house or stockade for they were quite buried among trees and if it had not been for the chart on the companion we might have been the first that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the seas  there was not a breath of air moving nor a sound but that of the surf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks outside a peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorage a smell of sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks i observed the doctor sniffing and sniffing like someone tasting a bad egg  i dont know about treasure he said but ill stake my wig theres fever here  if the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat it became truly threatening when they had come aboard they lay about the deck growling together in talk the slightest order was received with a black look and grudgingly and carelessly obeyed even the honest hands must have caught the infection for there was not one man aboard to mend another mutiny it was plain hung over us like a thundercloud  and it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger long john was hard at work going from group to group spending himself in good advice and as for example no man could have shown a better he fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility he was all smiles to everyone if an order were given john would be on his crutch in an instant with the cheeriest aye aye sir in the world and when there was nothing else to do he kept up one song after another as if to conceal the discontent of the rest  of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon this obvious anxiety on the part of long john appeared the worst  we held a council in the cabin  sir said the captain if i risk another order the whole shipll come about our ears by the run you see sir here it is i get a rough answer do i not well if i speak back pikes will be going in two shakes if i dont silver will see theres something under that and the games up now weve only one man to rely on  and who is that asked the squire  silver sir returned the captain hes as anxious as you and i to smother things up this is a tiff hed soon talk em out of it if he had the chance and what i propose to do is to give him the chance lets allow the men an afternoon ashore if they all go why well fight the ship if they none of them go well then we hold the cabin and god defend the right if some go you mark my words sir silverll bring em aboard again as mild as lambs  it was so decided loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men hunter joyce and redruth were taken into our confidence and received the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew  my lads said he weve had a hot day and are all tired and out of sorts a turn ashorell hurt nobody the boats are still in the water you can take the gigs and as many as please may go ashore for the afternoon ill fire a gun half an hour before sundown  i believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their shins over treasure as soon as they were landed for they all came out of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the anchorage  the captain was too bright to be in the way he whipped out of sight in a moment leaving silver to arrange the party and i fancy it was as well he did so had he been on deck he could no longer so much as have pretended not to understand the situation it was as plain as day silver was the captain and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it the honest hands and i was soon to see it proved that there were such on board must have been very stupid fellows or rather i suppose the truth was this that all hands were disaffected by the example of the ringleaders only some more some less and a few being good fellows in the main could neither be led nor driven any further it is one thing to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent men  at last however the party was made up six fellows were to stay on board and the remaining thirteen including silver began to embark  then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives if six men were left by silver it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship and since only six were left it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance it occurred to me at once to go ashore in a jiffy i had slipped over the side and curled up in the foresheets of the nearest boat and almost at the same moment she shoved off  no one took notice of me only the bow oar saying is that you jim keep your head down but silver from the other boat looked sharply over and called out to know if that were me and from that moment i began to regret what i had done  the crews raced for the beach but the boat i was in having some start and being at once the lighter and the better manned shot far ahead of her consort and the bow had struck among the shoreside trees and i had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest thicket while silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind  jim jim i heard him shouting  but you may suppose i paid no heed jumping ducking and breaking through i ran straight before my nose till i could run no longer     xiv the first blow   i was so pleased at having given the slip to long john that i began to enjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land that i was in  i had crossed a marshy tract full of willows bulrushes and odd outlandish swampy trees and i had now come out upon the skirts of an open piece of undulating sandy country about a mile long dotted with a few pines and a great number of contorted trees not unlike the oak in growth but pale in the foliage like willows on the far side of the open stood one of the hills with two quaint craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun  i now felt for the first time the joy of exploration the isle was uninhabited my shipmates i had left behind and nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls i turned hither and thither among the trees here and there were flowering plants unknown to me here and there i saw snakes and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top little did i suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous rattle  then i came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees live or evergreen oaks i heard afterwards they should be called which grew low along the sand like brambles the boughs curiously twisted the foliage compact like thatch the thicket stretched down from the top of one of the sandy knolls spreading and growing taller as it went until it reached the margin of the broad reedy fen through which the nearest of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage the marsh was steaming in the strong sun and the outline of the spyglass trembled through the haze  all at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes a wild duck flew up with a quack another followed and soon over the whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and circling in the air i judged at once that some of my shipmates must be drawing near along the borders of the fen nor was i deceived for soon i heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice which as i continued to give ear grew steadily louder and nearer  this put me in a great fear and i crawled under cover of the nearest liveoak and squatted there hearkening as silent as a mouse  another voice answered and then the first voice which i now recognized to be silvers once more took up the story and ran on for a long while in a stream only now and again interrupted by the other by the sound they must have been talking earnestly and almost fiercely but no distinct word came to my hearing  at last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down for not only did they cease to draw any nearer but the birds themselves began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the swamp  and now i began to feel that i was neglecting my business that since i had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes the least i could do was to overhear them at their councils and that my plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as i could manage under the favourable ambush of the crouching trees  i could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly not only by the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders  crawling on all fours i made steadily but slowly towards them till at last raising my head to an aperture among the leaves i could see clear down into a little green dell beside the marsh and closely set about with trees where long john silver and another of the crew stood face to face in conversation  the sun beat full upon them silver had thrown his hat beside him on the ground and his great smooth blond face all shining with heat was lifted to the other mans in a kind of appeal  mate he was saying its because i thinks gold dust of you gold dust and you may lay to that if i hadnt took to you like pitch do you think id have been here awarning of you alls up you cant make nor mend its to save your neck that im aspeaking and if one of the wild uns knew it whered i be tom now tell me whered i be  silver said the other man and i observed he was not only red in the face but spoke as hoarse as a crow and his voice shook too like a taut rope silver says he youre old and youre honest or has the name for it and youve money too which lots of poor sailors hasnt and youre brave or im mistook and will you tell me youll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs not you as sure as god sees me id sooner lose my hand if i turn agin my dooty   and then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise i had found one of the honest hands well here at that same moment came news of another far away out in the marsh there arose all of a sudden a sound like the cry of anger then another on the back of it and then one horrid longdrawn scream the rocks of the spyglass reechoed it a score of times the whole troop of marshbirds rose again darkening heaven with a simultaneous whirr and long after that death yell was still ringing in my brain silence had reestablished its empire and only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon  tom had leaped at the sound like a horse at the spur but silver had not winked an eye he stood where he was resting lightly on his crutch watching his companion like a snake about to spring  john said the sailor stretching out his hand  hands off cried silver leaping back a yard as it seemed to me with the speed and security of a trained gymnast  hands off if you like john silver said the other its a black conscience that can make you feared of me but in heavens name tell me what was that  that returned silver smiling away but warier than ever his eye a mere pinpoint in his big face but gleaming like a crumb of glass that oh i reckon thatll be alan  and at this point tom flashed out like a hero  alan he cried then rest his soul for a true seaman and as for you john silver long youve been a mate of mine but youre mate of mine no more if i die like a dog ill die in my dooty youve killed alan have you kill me too if you can but i defies you  and with that this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook and set off walking for the beach but he was not destined to go far with a cry john seized the branch of a tree whipped the crutch out of his armpit and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air it struck poor tom point foremost and with stunning violence right between the shoulders in the middle of his back his hands flew up he gave a sort of gasp and fell  whether he were injured much or little none could ever tell like enough to judge from the sound his back was broken on the spot but he had no time given him to recover silver agile as a monkey even without leg or crutch was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body from my place of ambush i could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows  i do not know what it rightly is to faint but i do know that for the next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling mist silver and the birds and the tall spyglass hilltop going round and round and topsyturvy before my eyes and all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear  when i came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together his crutch under his arm his hat upon his head just before him tom lay motionless upon the sward but the murderer minded him not a whit cleansing his bloodstained knife the while upon a wisp of grass everything else was unchanged the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain and i could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes  but now john put his hand into his pocket brought out a whistle and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air i could not tell of course the meaning of the signal but it instantly awoke my fears more men would be coming i might be discovered they had already slain two of the honest people after tom and alan might not i come next  instantly i began to extricate myself and crawl back again with what speed and silence i could manage to the more open portion of the wood as i did so i could hear hails coming and going between the old buccaneer and his comrades and this sound of danger lent me wings as soon as i was clear of the thicket i ran as i never ran before scarce minding the direction of my flight so long as it led me from the murderers and as i ran fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into a kind of frenzy  indeed could anyone be more entirely lost than i when the gun fired how should i dare to go down to the boats among those fiends still smoking from their crime would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipes would not my absence itself be an evidence to them of my alarm and therefore of my fatal knowledge it was all over i thought goodbye to the hispaniola goodbye to the squire the doctor and the captain there was nothing left for me but death by starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers  all this while as i say i was still running and without taking any notice i had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two peaks and had got into a part of the island where the liveoaks grew more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and dimensions mingled with these were a few scattered pines some fifty some nearer seventy feet high the air too smelt more freshly than down beside the marsh  and here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart     xv the man of the island   from the side of the hill which was here steep and stony a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees my eyes turned instinctively in that direction and i saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine what it was whether bear or man or monkey i could in no wise tell it seemed dark and shaggy more i knew not but the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand  i was now it seemed cut off upon both sides behind me the murderers before me this lurking nondescript and immediately i began to prefer the dangers that i knew to those i knew not silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods and i turned on my heel and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats  instantly the figure reappeared and making a wide circuit began to head me off i was tired at any rate but had i been as fresh as when i rose i could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary from trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer running manlike on two legs but unlike any man that i had ever seen stooping almost double as it ran yet a man it was i could no longer be in doubt about that  i began to recall what i had heard of cannibals i was within an ace of calling for help but the mere fact that he was a man however wild had somewhat reassured me and my fear of silver began to revive in proportion i stood still therefore and cast about for some method of escape and as i was so thinking the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind as soon as i remembered i was not defenceless courage glowed again in my heart and i set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him  he was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk but he must have been watching me closely for as soon as i began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me then he hesitated drew back came forward again and at last to my wonder and confusion threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication  at that i once more stopped  who are you i asked  ben gunn he answered and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward like a rusty lock im poor ben gunn i am and i havent spoke with a christian these three years  i could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing his skin wherever it was exposed was burnt by the sun even his lips were black and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face of all the beggarmen that i had seen or fancied he was the chief for raggedness he was clothed with tatters of old ships canvas and old seacloth and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fastenings brass buttons bits of stick and loops of tarry gaskin about his waist he wore an old brassbuckled leather belt which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement  three years i cried were you shipwrecked  nay mate said he marooned  i had heard the word and i knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island  marooned three years agone he continued and lived on goats since then and berries and oysters wherever a man is says i a man can do for himself but mate my heart is sore for christian diet you mightnt happen to have a piece of cheese about you now no well manys the long night ive dreamed of cheese toasted mostly and woke up again and here i were  if ever i can get aboard again said i you shall have cheese by the stone  all this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket smoothing my hands looking at my boots and generally in the intervals of his speech showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature but at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness  if ever you can get aboard again says you he repeated why now whos to hinder you  not you i know was my reply  and right you was he cried now you what do you call yourself mate  jim i told him  jim jim says he quite pleased apparently well now jim ive lived that rough as youd be ashamed to hear of now for instance you wouldnt think i had had a pious mother to look at me he asked  why no not in particular i answered  ah well said he but i had remarkable pious and i was a civil pious boy and could rattle off my catechism that fast as you couldnt tell one word from another and heres what it come to jim and it begun with chuckfarthen on the blessed gravestones thats what it begun with but it went furthern that and so my mother told me and predicked the whole she did the pious woman but it were providence that put me here ive thought it all out in this here lonely island and im back on piety you dont catch me tasting rum so much but just a thimbleful for luck of course the first chance i have im bound ill be good and i see the way to and jim looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper im rich  i now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude and i suppose i must have shown the feeling in my face for he repeated the statement hotly  rich rich i says and ill tell you what  ill make a man of you jim ah jim youll bless your stars you will you was the first that found me  and at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes  now jim you tell me true  that aint flints ship he asked  at this i had a happy inspiration i began to believe that i had found an ally and i answered him at once  its not flints ship and flint is dead but ill tell you true as you ask me there are some of flints hands aboard worse luck for the rest of us  not a man with one leg he gasped  silver i asked  ah silver says he that were his name  hes the cook and the ringleader too  he was still holding me by the wrist and at that he give it quite a wring  if you was sent by long john he said im as good as pork and i know it but where was you do you suppose  i had made my mind up in a moment and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves he heard me with the keenest interest and when i had done he patted me on the head  youre a good lad jim he said and youre all in a clove hitch aint you well you just put your trust in ben gunn ben gunns the man to do it would you think it likely now that your squire would prove a liberalminded one in case of help him being in a clove hitch as you remark  i told him the squire was the most liberal of men  aye but you see returned ben gunn i didnt mean giving me a gate to keep and a suit of livery clothes and such thats not my mark jim what i mean is would he be likely to come down to the toon of say one thousand pounds out of money thats as good as a mans own already  i am sure he would said i as it was all hands were to share  and a passage home he added with a look of great shrewdness  why i cried the squires a gentleman and besides if we got rid of the others we should want you to help work the vessel home  ah said he so you would and he seemed very much relieved  now ill tell you what he went on so much ill tell you and no more i were in flints ship when he buried the treasure he and six along six strong seamen they was ashore nigh on a week and us standing off and on in the old walrus one fine day up went the signal and here come flint by himself in a little boat and his head done up in a blue scarf the sun was getting up and mortal white he looked about the cutwater but there he was you mind and the six all dead dead and buried how he done it not a man aboard us could make out it was battle murder and sudden death leastways him against six billy bones was the mate long john he was quartermaster and they asked him where the treasure was ah says he you can go ashore if you like and stay he says but as for the ship shell beat up for more by thunder thats what he said  well i was in another ship three years back and we sighted this island boys said i heres flints treasure lets land and find it the capn was displeased at that but my messmates were all of a mind and landed twelve days they looked for it and every day they had the worse word for me until one fine morning all hands went aboard as for you benjamin gunn says they heres a musket they says and a spade and pickaxe you can stay here and find flints money for yourself they says  well jim three years have i been here and not a bite of christian diet from that day to this but now you look here look at me do i look like a man before the mast no says you nor i werent neither i says  and with that he winked and pinched me hard  just you mention them words to your squire jim he went on nor he werent neither thats the words three years he were the man of this island light and dark fair and rain and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer says you and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother so be as shes alive youll say but the most part of gunns time this is what youll say the most part of his time was took up with another matter and then youll give him a nip like i do  and he pinched me again in the most confidential manner  then he continued then youll up and youll say this  gunn is a good man youll say and he puts a precious sight more confidence a precious sight mind that in a genleman born than in these genleman of fortune having been one hisself  well i said i dont understand one word that youve been saying but thats neither here nor there for how am i to get on board  ah said he thats the hitch for sure well theres my boat that i made with my two hands i keep her under the white rock if the worst come to the worst we might try that after dark hi he broke out whats that  for just then although the sun had still an hour or two to run all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon  they have begun to fight i cried follow me  and i began to run towards the anchorage my terrors all forgotten while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly  left left says he keep to your left hand mate jim under the trees with you theers where i killed my first goat they dont come down here now theyre all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of benjamin gunn ah and theres the cetemery cemetery he must have meant you see the mounds i come here and prayed nows and thens when i thought maybe a sunday would be about doo it werent quite a chapel but it seemed more solemn like and then says you ben gunn was shorthanded no chapling nor so much as a bible and a flag you says  so he kept talking as i ran neither expecting nor receiving any answer  the cannonshot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms  another pause and then not a quarter of a mile in front of me i beheld the union jack flutter in the air above a wood     part four the stockade     xvi narrative continued by the doctor  how the ship was abandoned   it was about half past one three bells in the sea phrase that the two boats went ashore from the hispaniola the captain the squire and i were talking matters over in the cabin had there been a breath of wind we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us slipped our cable and away to sea but the wind was wanting and to complete our helplessness down came hunter with the news that jim hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest  it never occurred to us to doubt jim hawkins but we were alarmed for his safety with the men in the temper they were in it seemed an even chance if we should see the lad again we ran on deck the pitch was bubbling in the seams the nasty stench of the place turned me sick if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery it was in that abominable anchorage the six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the forecastle ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting in each hard by where the river runs in one of them was whistling lillibullero  waiting was a strain and it was decided that hunter and i should go ashore with the jollyboat in quest of information  the gigs had leaned to their right but hunter and i pulled straight in in the direction of the stockade upon the chart the two who were left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance lillibullero stopped off and i could see the pair discussing what they ought to do had they gone and told silver all might have turned out differently but they had their orders i suppose and decided to sit quietly where they were and hark back again to lillibullero  there was a slight bend in the coast and i steered so as to put it between us even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs i jumped out and came as near running as i durst with a big silk handkerchief under my hat for coolness sake and a brace of pistols ready primed for safety  i had not gone a hundred yards when i reached the stockade  this was how it was  a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a knoll well on the knoll and enclosing the spring they had clapped a stout loghouse fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed for musketry on either side all round this they had cleared a wide space and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high without door or opening too strong to pull down without time and labour and too open to shelter the besiegers the people in the loghouse had them in every way they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like partridges all they wanted was a good watch and food for short of a complete surprise they might have held the place against a regiment  what particularly took my fancy was the spring for though we had a good enough place of it in the cabin of the hispaniola with plenty of arms and ammunition and things to eat and excellent wines there had been one thing overlooked we had no water i was thinking this over when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death i was not new to violent death i have served his royal highness the duke of cumberland and got a wound myself at fontenoy but i know my pulse went dot and carry one jim hawkins is gone was my first thought  it is something to have been an old soldier but more still to have been a doctor there is no time to dillydally in our work and so now i made up my mind instantly and with no time lost returned to the shore and jumped on board the jollyboat  by good fortune hunter pulled a good oar we made the water fly and the boat was soon alongside and i aboard the schooner  i found them all shaken as was natural the squire was sitting down as white as a sheet thinking of the harm he had led us to the good soul and one of the six forecastle hands was little better  theres a man says captain smollett nodding towards him new to this work he came nighhand fainting doctor when he heard the cry another touch of the rudder and that man would join us  i told my plan to the captain and between us we settled on the details of its accomplishment  we put old redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection hunter brought the boat round under the sternport and joyce and i set to work loading her with powder tins muskets bags of biscuits kegs of pork a cask of cognac and my invaluable medicine chest  in the meantime the squire and the captain stayed on deck and the latter hailed the coxswain who was the principal man aboard  mr hands he said here are two of us with a brace of pistols each if any one of you six make a signal of any description that mans dead  they were a good deal taken aback and after a little consultation one and all tumbled down the fore companion thinking no doubt to take us on the rear but when they saw redruth waiting for them in the sparred galley they went about ship at once and a head popped out again on deck  down dog cries the captain  and the head popped back again and we heard no more for the time of these six very fainthearted seamen  by this time tumbling things in as they came we had the jollyboat loaded as much as we dared joyce and i got out through the sternport and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us  this second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore lillibullero  was dropped again and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point one of them whipped ashore and disappeared i had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their boats but i feared that silver and the others might be close at hand and all might very well be lost by trying for too much  we had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to provision the block house all three made the first journey heavily laden and tossed our stores over the palisade then leaving joyce to guard them one man to be sure but with half a dozen muskets hunter and i returned to the jollyboat and loaded ourselves once more so we proceeded without pausing to take breath till the whole cargo was bestowed when the two servants took up their position in the block house and i with all my power sculled back to the hispaniola  that we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it really was they had the advantage of numbers of course but we had the advantage of arms not one of the men ashore had a musket and before they could get within range for pistol shooting we flattered ourselves we should be able to give a good account of a halfdozen at least  the squire was waiting for me at the stern window all his faintness gone from him he caught the painter and made it fast and we fell to loading the boat for our very lives pork powder and biscuit was the cargo with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me and redruth and the captain the rest of the arms and powder we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of water so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us in the sun on the clean sandy bottom  by this time the tide was beginning to ebb and the ship was swinging round to her anchor voices were heard faintly halloaing in the direction of the two gigs and though this reassured us for joyce and hunter who were well to the eastward it warned our party to be off  redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the boat which we then brought round to the ships counter to be handier for captain smollett  now men said he do you hear me  there was no answer from the forecastle  its to you abraham gray its to you i am speaking  still no reply  gray resumed mr smollett a little louder i am leaving this ship and i order you to follow your captain i know you are a good man at bottom and i dare say not one of the lot of yous as bad as he makes out i have my watch here in my hand i give you thirty seconds to join me in  there was a pause  come my fine fellow continued the captain dont hang so long in stays im risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every second  there was a sudden scuffle a sound of blows and out burst abraham gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek and came running to the captain like a dog to the whistle  im with you sir said he  and the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us and we had shoved off and given way  we were clear out of the ship but not yet ashore in our stockade     xxvii narrative continued by the doctor  the jollyboats last trip   this fifth trip was quite different from any of the others in the first place the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded five grown men and three of them trelawney redruth and the captain over six feet high was already more than she was meant to carry add to that the powder pork and breadbags the gunwale was lipping astern several times we shipped a little water and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards  the captain made us trim the boat and we got her to lie a little more evenly all the same we were afraid to breathe  in the second place the ebb was now making a strong rippling current running westward through the basin and then southard and seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft but the worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landingplace behind the point if we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs where the pirates might appear at any moment  i cannot keep her head for the stockade sir said i to the captain i was steering while he and redruth two fresh men were at the oars the tide keeps washing her down could you pull a little stronger  not without swamping the boat said he you must bear up sir if you please bear up until you see youre gaining  i tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward until i had laid her head due east or just about right angles to the way we ought to go  well never get ashore at this rate said i  if its the only course that we can lie sir we must even lie it  returned the captain we must keep upstream you see sir he went on if once we dropped to leeward of the landingplace its hard to say where we should get ashore besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs whereas the way we go the current must slacken and then we can dodge back along the shore  the currents less aready sir said the man gray who was sitting in the foresheets you can ease her off a bit  thank you my man said i quite as if nothing had happened for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves  suddenly the captain spoke up again and i thought his voice was a little changed  the gun said he  i have thought of that said i for i made sure he was thinking of a bombardment of the fort they could never get the gun ashore and if they did they could never haul it through the woods  look astern doctor replied the captain  we had entirely forgotten the long nine and there to our horror were the five rogues busy about her getting off her jacket as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed not only that but it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the roundshot and the powder for the gun had been left behind and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad  israel was flints gunner said gray hoarsely  at any risk we put the boats head direct for the landingplace by this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing and i could keep her steady for the goal but the worst of it was that with the course i now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the hispaniola and offered a target like a barn door  i could hear as well as see that brandyfaced rascal israel hands plumping down a roundshot on the deck  whos the best shot asked the captain  mr trelawney out and away said i  mr trelawney will you please pick me off one of these men sir hands if possible said the captain  trelawney was as cool as steel he looked to the priming of his gun  now cried the captain easy with that gun sir or youll swamp the boat all hands stand by to trim her when he aims  the squire raised his gun the rowing ceased and we leaned over to the other side to keep the balance and all was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop  they had the gun by this time slewed round upon the swivel and hands who was at the muzzle with the rammer was in consequence the most exposed however we had no luck for just as trelawney fired down he stooped the ball whistled over him and it was one of the other four who fell  the cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore and looking in that direction i saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats  here come the gigs sir said i  give way then cried the captain we mustnt mind if we swamp her now if we cant get ashore alls up  only one of the gigs is being manned sir i added the crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off  theyll have a hot run sir returned the captain jack ashore you know its not them i mind its the roundshot carpet bowls my ladys maid couldnt miss tell us squire when you see the match and well hold water  in the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded and we had shipped but little water in the process we were now close in thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her for the ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering trees the gig was no longer to be feared the little point had already concealed it from our eyes the ebbtide which had so cruelly delayed us was now making reparation and delaying our assailants the one source of danger was the gun  if i durst said the captain id stop and pick off another man  but it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot they had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade though he was not dead and i could see him trying to crawl away  ready cried the squire  hold cried the captain quick as an echo  and he and redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily under water the report fell in at the same instant of time this was the first that jim heard the sound of the squires shot not having reached him where the ball passed not one of us precisely knew but i fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have contributed to our disaster  at any rate the boat sank by the stern quite gently in three feet of water leaving the captain and myself facing each other on our feet the other three took complete headers and came up again drenched and bubbling  so far there was no great harm no lives were lost and we could wade ashore in safety but there were all our stores at the bottom and to make things worse only two guns out of five remained in a state for service mine i had snatched from my knees and held over my head by a sort of instinct as for the captain he had carried his over his shoulder by a bandoleer and like a wise man lock uppermost the other three had gone down with the boat  to add to our concern we heard voices already drawing near us in the woods along shore and we had not only the danger of being cut off from the stockade in our halfcrippled state but the fear before us whether if hunter and joyce were attacked by half a dozen they would have the sense and conduct to stand firm hunter was steady that we knew joyce was a doubtful case a pleasant polite man for a valet and to brush ones clothes but not entirely fitted for a man of war  with all this in our minds we waded ashore as fast as we could leaving behind us the poor jollyboat and a good half of all our powder and provisions     xviii narrative continued by the doctor  end of the first days fighting   we made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from the stockade and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers rang nearer soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket  i began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my priming  captain said i trelawney is the dead shot give him your gun his own is useless  they exchanged guns and trelawney silent and cool as he had been since the beginning of the bustle hung a moment on his heel to see that all was fit for service at the same time observing gray to be unarmed i handed him my cutlass it did all our hearts good to see him spit in his hand knit his brows and make the blade sing through the air it was plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt  forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade in front of us we struck the enclosure about the middle of the south side and almost at the same time seven mutineers job anderson the boatswain at their head appeared in full cry at the southwestern corner  they paused as if taken aback and before they recovered not only the squire and i but hunter and joyce from the block house had time to fire the four shots came in rather a scattering volley but they did the business  one of the enemy actually fell and the rest without hesitation turned and plunged into the trees  after reloading we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the fallen enemy he was stone dead shot through the heart  we began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a pistol cracked in the bush a ball whistled close past my ear and poor tom redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground both the squire and i returned the shot but as we had nothing to aim at it is probable we only wasted powder then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor tom  the captain and gray were already examining him and i saw with half an eye that all was over  i believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried groaning and bleeding into the loghouse  poor old fellow he had not uttered one word of surprise complaint fear or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now when we had laid him down in the loghouse to die he had lain like a trojan behind his mattress in the gallery he had followed every order silently doggedly and well he was the oldest of our party by a score of years and now sullen old serviceable servant it was he that was to die  the squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand crying like a child  be i going doctor he asked  tom my man said i youre going home  i wish i had had a lick at them with the gun first he replied  tom said the squire say you forgive me wont you  would that be respectful like from me to you squire was the answer howsoever so be it amen  after a little while of silence he said he thought somebody might read a prayer its the custom sir he added apologetically and not long after without another word he passed away  in the meantime the captain whom i had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets had turned out a great many various stores the british colours a bible a coil of stoutish rope pen ink the logbook and pounds of tobacco he had found a longish firtree lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure and with the help of hunter he had set it up at the corner of the loghouse where the trunks crossed and made an angle then climbing on the roof he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours  this seemed mightily to relieve him he reentered the loghouse and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed but he had an eye on toms passage for all that and as soon as all was over came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body  dont you take on sir he said shaking the squires hand alls well with him no fear for a hand thats been shot down in his duty to captain and owner it maynt be good divinity but its a fact  then he pulled me aside  dr livesey he said in how many weeks do you and squire expect the consort  i told him it was a question not of weeks but of months that if we were not back by the end of august blandly was to send to find us but neither sooner nor later you can calculate for yourself i said  why yes returned the captain scratching his head and making a large allowance sir for all the gifts of providence i should say we were pretty close hauled  how do you mean i asked  its a pity sir we lost that second load thats what i mean  replied the captain as for powder and shot well do but the rations are short very short so short dr livesey that were perhaps as well without that extra mouth  and he pointed to the dead body under the flag  just then with a roar and a whistle a roundshot passed high above the roof of the loghouse and plumped far beyond us in the wood  oho said the captain blaze away youve little enough powder already my lads  at the second trial the aim was better and the ball descended inside the stockade scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage  captain said the squire the house is quite invisible from the ship it must be the flag they are aiming at would it not be wiser to take it in  strike my colours cried the captain no sir not i and as soon as he had said the words i think we all agreed with him for it was not only a piece of stout seamanly good feeling it was good policy besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade  all through the evening they kept thundering away ball after ball flew over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure but they had to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft sand we had no ricochet to fear and though one popped in through the roof of the loghouse and out again through the floor we soon got used to that sort of horseplay and minded it no more than cricket  there is one good thing about all this observed the captain the wood in front of us is likely clear the ebb has made a good while our stores should be uncovered volunteers to go and bring in pork  gray and hunter were the first to come forward well armed they stole out of the stockade but it proved a useless mission the mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in israels gunnery for four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current silver was in the sternsheets in command and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own  the captain sat down to his log and here is the beginning of the entry        alexander smollett master david livesey ships      doctor abraham gray carpenters mate john      trelawney owner john hunter and richard joyce      owners servants landsmen being all that is left      faithful of the ships company with stores for ten      days at short rations came ashore this day and flew      british colours on the loghouse in treasure island      thomas redruth owners servant landsman shot by the      mutineers james hawkins cabinboy   and at the same time i was wondering over poor jim hawkins fate  a hail on the land side  somebody hailing us said hunter who was on guard  doctor squire captain hullo hunter is that you came the cries  and i ran to the door in time to see jim hawkins safe and sound come climbing over the stockade     xix narrative resumed by jim hawkins  the garrison in the stockade   as soon as ben gunn saw the colours he came to a halt stopped me by the arm and sat down  now said he theres your friends sure enough  far more likely its the mutineers i answered  that he cried why in a place like this where nobody puts in but genlemen of fortune silver would fly the jolly roger you dont make no doubt of that no thats your friends theres been blows too and i reckon your friends has had the best of it and here they are ashore in the old stockade as was made years and years ago by flint ah he was the man to have a headpiece was flint barring rum his match were never seen he were afraid of none not he ony silver silver was that genteel  well said i that may be so and so be it all the more reason that i should hurry on and join my friends  nay mate returned ben not you youre a good boy or im mistook but youre ony a boy all told now ben gunn is fly rum wouldnt bring me there where youre going not rum wouldnt till i see your born genleman and gets it on his word of honour and you wont forget my words a precious sight thats what youll say a precious sight more confidence and then nips him  and he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness  and when ben gunn is wanted you know where to find him jim just wheer you found him today and him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand and hes to come alone oh and youll say this  ben gunn says you has reasons of his own  well said i i believe i understand you have something to propose and you wish to see the squire or the doctor and youre to be found where i found you is that all  and when says you he added why from about noon observation to about six bells  good said i and now may i go  you wont forget he inquired anxiously precious sight and reasons of his own says you reasons of his own thats the mainstay as between man and man well then still holding me i reckon you can go jim and jim if you was to see silver you wouldnt go for to sell ben gunn wild horses wouldnt draw it from you no says you and if them pirates camp ashore jim what would you say but thered be widders in the morning  here he was interrupted by a loud report and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking the next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction  for a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island and balls kept crashing through the woods i moved from hidingplace to hidingplace always pursued or so it seemed to me by these terrifying missiles but towards the end of the bombardment though still i durst not venture in the direction of the stockade where the balls fell oftenest i had begun in a manner to pluck up my heart again and after a long detour to the east crept down among the shoreside trees  the sun had just set the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage the tide too was far out and great tracts of sand lay uncovered the air after the heat of the day chilled me through my jacket  the hispaniola still lay where she had anchored but sure enough there was the jolly roger the black flag of piracy flying from her peak even as i looked there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering and one more roundshot whistled through the air it was the last of the cannonade  i lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack men were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade the poor jollyboat i afterwards discovered away near the mouth of the river a great fire was glowing among the trees and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going the men whom i had seen so gloomy shouting at the oars like children but there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum  at length i thought i might return towards the stockade i was pretty far down on the low sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east and is joined at halfwater to skeleton island and now as i rose to my feet i saw some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes an isolated rock pretty high and peculiarly white in colour it occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which ben gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and i should know where to look for one  then i skirted among the woods until i had regained the rear or shoreward side of the stockade and was soon warmly welcomed by the faithful party  i had soon told my story and began to look about me the loghouse was made of unsquared trunks of pine roof walls and floor the latter stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the surface of the sand there was a porch at the door and under this porch the little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd kind no other than a great ships kettle of iron with the bottom knocked out and sunk to her bearings as the captain said among the sand  little had been left besides the framework of the house but in one corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old rusty iron basket to contain the fire  the slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been cleared of timber to build the house and we could see by the stumps what a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed most of the soil had been washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees only where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and some ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand very close around the stockade too close for defence they said the wood still flourished high and dense all of fir on the land side but towards the sea with a large admixture of liveoaks  the cold evening breeze of which i have spoken whistled through every chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain of fine sand there was sand in our eyes sand in our teeth sand in our suppers sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle for all the world like porridge beginning to boil our chimney was a square hole in the roof it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way out and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping the eye  add to this that gray the new man had his face tied up in a bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor old tom redruth still unburied lay along the wall stiff and stark under the union jack  if we had been allowed to sit idle we should all have fallen in the blues but captain smollett was never the man for that all hands were called up before him and he divided us into watches the doctor and gray and i for one the squire hunter and joyce upon the other tired though we all were two were sent out for firewood two more were set to dig a grave for redruth the doctor was named cook i was put sentry at the door and the captain himself went from one to another keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted  from time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to rest his eyes which were almost smoked out of his head and whenever he did so he had a word for me  that man smollett he said once is a better man than i am and when i say that it means a deal jim  another time he came and was silent for a while then he put his head on one side and looked at me  is this ben gunn a man he asked  i do not know sir said i i am not very sure whether hes sane  if theres any doubt about the matter he is returned the doctor a man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island jim cant expect to appear as sane as you or me it doesnt lie in human nature was it cheese you said he had a fancy for  yes sir cheese i answered  well jim says he just see the good that comes of being dainty in your food youve seen my snuffbox havent you and you never saw me take snuff the reason being that in my snuffbox i carry a piece of parmesan cheese a cheese made in italy very nutritious well thats for ben gunn  before supper was eaten we buried old tom in the sand and stood round him for a while bareheaded in the breeze a good deal of firewood had been got in but not enough for the captains fancy and he shook his head over it and told us we must get back to this tomorrow rather livelier then when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff glass of brandy grog the three chiefs got together in a corner to discuss our prospects  it appears they were at their wits end what to do the stores being so low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came but our best hope it was decided was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the hispaniola from nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen two others were wounded and one at least the man shot beside the gun severely wounded if he were not dead every time we had a crack at them we were to take it saving our own lives with the extremest care and besides that we had two able allies rum and the climate  as for the first though we were about half a mile away we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night and as for the second the doctor staked his wig that camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies the half of them would be on their backs before a week  so he added if we are not all shot down first theyll be glad to be packing in the schooner its always a ship and they can get to buccaneering again i suppose  first ship that ever i lost said captain smollett  i was dead tired as you may fancy and when i got to sleep which was not till after a great deal of tossing i slept like a log of wood  the rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when i was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices  flag of truce i heard someone say and then immediately after with a cry of surprise silver himself  and at that up i jumped and rubbing my eyes ran to a loophole in the wall     xx silvers embassy   sure enough there were two men just outside the stockade one of them waving a white cloth the other no less a person than silver himself standing placidly by  it was still quite early and the coldest morning that i think i ever was abroad in a chill that pierced into the marrow the sky was bright and cloudless overhead and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun but where silver stood with his lieutenant all was still in shadow and they waded kneedeep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass the chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island it was plainly a damp feverish unhealthy spot  keep indoors men said the captain ten to one this is a trick  then he hailed the buccaneer  who goes stand or we fire  flag of truce cried silver  the captain was in the porch keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot should any be intended he turned and spoke to us doctors watch on the lookout dr livesey take the north side if you please jim the east gray west the watch below all hands to load muskets lively men and careful  and then he turned again to the mutineers  and what do you want with your flag of truce he cried  this time it was the other man who replied  capn silver sir to come on board and make terms he shouted  capn silver dont know him whos he cried the captain and we could hear him adding to himself capn is it my heart and heres promotion  long john answered for himself me sir these poor lads have chosen me capn after your desertion sir laying a particular emphasis upon the word desertion were willing to submit if we can come to terms and no bones about it all i ask is your word capn smollett to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade and one minute to get out o shot before a gun is fired  my man said captain smollett i have not the slightest desire to talk to you if you wish to talk to me you can come thats all if theres any treachery itll be on your side and the lord help you  thats enough capn shouted long john cheerily a word from yous enough i know a gentleman and you may lay to that  we could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold silver back nor was that wonderful seeing how cavalier had been the captains answer but silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd then he advanced to the stockade threw over his crutch got a leg up and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side  i will confess that i was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry indeed i had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain who had now seated himself on the threshold with his elbows on his knees his head in his hands and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand he was whistling come lasses and lads  silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll what with the steepness of the incline the thick tree stumps and the soft sand he and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays but he stuck to it like a man in silence and at last arrived before the captain whom he saluted in the handsomest style he was tricked out in his best an immense blue coat thick with brass buttons hung as low as to his knees and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head  here you are my man said the captain raising his head you had better sit down  you aint agoing to let me inside capn complained long john its a main cold morning to be sure sir to sit outside upon the sand  why silver said the captain if you had pleased to be an honest man you might have been sitting in your galley its your own doing youre either my ships cook and then you were treated handsome or capn silver a common mutineer and pirate and then you can go hang  well well capn returned the seacook sitting down as he was bidden on the sand youll have to give me a hand up again thats all a sweet pretty place you have of it here ah theres jim the top of the morning to you jim doctor heres my service why there you all are together like a happy family in a manner of speaking  if you have anything to say my man better say it said the captain  right you were capn smollett replied silver dooty is dooty to be sure well now you look here that was a good lay of yours last night i dont deny it was a good lay some of you pretty handy with a handspikeend and ill not deny neither but what some of my people was shook maybe all was shook maybe i was shook myself maybe thats why im here for terms but you mark me capn it wont do twice by thunder well have to do sentrygo and ease off a point or so on the rum maybe you think we were all a sheet in the winds eye but ill tell you i was sober i was ony dog tired and if id awoke a second sooner id a caught you at the act i would he wasnt dead when i got round to him not he  well says captain smollett as cool as can be  all that silver said was a riddle to him but you would never have guessed it from his tone as for me i began to have an inkling ben gunns last words came back to my mind i began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire and i reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with  well here it is said silver we want that treasure and well have it thats our point you would just as soon save your lives i reckon and thats yours you have a chart havent you  thats as may be replied the captain  oh well you have i know that returned long john you neednt be so husky with a man there aint a particle of service in that and you may lay to it what i mean is we want your chart now i never meant you no harm myself  that wont do with me my man interrupted the captain we know exactly what you meant to do and we dont care for now you see you cant do it  and the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe  if abe gray  silver broke out  avast there cried mr smollett gray told me nothing and i asked him nothing and whats more i would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first so theres my mind for you my man on that  this little whiff of temper seemed to cool silver down he had been growing nettled before but now he pulled himself together  like enough said he i would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape or might not as the case were and seein as how you are about to take a pipe capn ill make so free as do likewise  and he filled a pipe and lighted it and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while now looking each other in the face now stopping their tobacco now leaning forward to spit it was as good as the play to see them  now resumed silver here it is you give us the chart to get the treasure by and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep you do that and well offer you a choice either you come aboard along of us once the treasure shipped and then ill give you my affydavy upon my word of honour to clap you somewhere safe ashore or if that aint to your fancy some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing then you can stay here you can well divide stores with you man for man and ill give my affydavy as before to speak the first ship i sight and send em here to pick you up now youll own thats talking handsomer you couldnt look to get now you and i hope raising his voice that all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words for what is spoke to one is spoke to all  captain smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand  is that all he asked  every last word by thunder answered john refuse that and youve seen the last of me but musketballs  very good said the captain now youll hear me if youll come up one by one unarmed ill engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in england if you wont my name is alexander smollett ive flown my sovereigns colours and ill see you all to davy jones you cant find the treasure you cant sail the ship theres not a man among you fit to sail the ship you cant fight us gray there got away from five of you your ships in irons master silver youre on a lee shore and so youll find i stand here and tell you so and theyre the last good words youll get from me for in the name of heaven ill put a bullet in your back when next i meet you tramp my lad bundle out of this please hand over hand and double quick  silvers face was a picture his eyes started in his head with wrath he shook the fire out of his pipe  give me a hand up he cried  not i returned the captain  wholl give me a hand up he roared  not a man among us moved growling the foulest imprecations he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch then he spat into the spring  there he cried thats what i think of ye before an hours out ill stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon laugh by thunder laugh before an hours out yell laugh upon the other side them that diell be the lucky ones  and with a dreadful oath he stumbled off ploughed down the sand was helped across the stockade after four or five failures by the man with the flag of truce and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees     xxi the attack   as soon as silver disappeared the captain who had been closely watching him turned towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his post but gray it was the first time we had ever seen him angry  quarters he roared and then as we all slunk back to our places gray he said ill put your name in the log youve stood by your duty like a seaman mr trelawney im surprised at you sir doctor i thought you had worn the kings coat if that was how you served at fontenoy sir youd have been better in your berth  the doctors watch were all back at their loopholes the rest were busy loading the spare muskets and everyone with a red face you may be certain and a flea in his ear as the saying is  the captain looked on for a while in silence then he spoke  my lads said he ive given silver a broadside i pitched it in redhot on purpose and before the hours out as he said we shall be boarded were outnumbered i neednt tell you that but we fight in shelter and a minute ago i should have said we fought with discipline ive no manner of doubt that we can drub them if you choose  then he went the rounds and saw as he said that all was clear  on the two short sides of the house east and west there were only two loopholes on the south side where the porch was two again and on the north side five there was a round score of muskets for the seven of us the firewood had been built into four piles tables you might say one about the middle of each side and on each of these tables some ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the defenders in the middle the cutlasses lay ranged  toss out the fire said the captain the chill is past and we mustnt have smoke in our eyes  the iron firebasket was carried bodily out by mr trelawney and the embers smothered among sand  hawkins hasnt had his breakfast hawkins help yourself and back to your post to eat it continued captain smollett lively now my lad youll want it before youve done hunter serve out a round of brandy to all hands  and while this was going on the captain completed in his own mind the plan of the defence  doctor you will take the door he resumed see and dont expose yourself keep within and fire through the porch hunter take the east side there joyce you stand by the west my man mr trelawney you are the best shot you and gray will take this long north side with the five loopholes its there the danger is if they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports things would begin to look dirty hawkins neither you nor i are much account at the shooting well stand by to load and bear a hand  as the captain had said the chill was past as soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught soon the sand was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block house jackets and coats were flung aside shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders and we stood there each at his post in a fever of heat and anxiety  an hour passed away  hang them said the captain this is as dull as the doldrums gray whistle for a wind  and just at that moment came the first news of the attack  if you please sir said joyce if i see anyone am i to fire  i told you so cried the captain  thank you sir returned joyce with the same quiet civility  nothing followed for a time but the remark had set us all on the alert straining ears and eyes the musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands the captain out in the middle of the block house with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face  so some seconds passed till suddenly joyce whipped up his musket and fired the report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley shot behind shot like a string of geese from every side of the enclosure several bullets struck the loghouse but not one entered and as the smoke cleared away and vanished the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before not a bough waved not the gleam of a musketbarrel betrayed the presence of our foes  did you hit your man asked the captain  no sir replied joyce i believe not sir  next best thing to tell the truth muttered captain smollett load his gun hawkins how many should say there were on your side doctor  i know precisely said dr livesey three shots were fired on this side i saw the three flashes two close together one farther to the west  three repeated the captain and how many on yours mr trelawney  but this was not so easily answered there had come many from the north seven by the squires computation eight or nine according to gray from the east and west only a single shot had been fired it was plain therefore that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities but captain smollett made no change in his arrangements if the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade he argued they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold  nor had we much time left to us for thought suddenly with a loud huzza a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side and ran straight on the stockade at the same moment the fire was once more opened from the woods and a rifle ball sang through the doorway and knocked the doctors musket into bits  the boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys squire and gray fired again and yet again three men fell one forwards into the enclosure two back on the outside but of these one was evidently more frightened than hurt for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees  two had bit the dust one had fled four had made good their footing inside our defences while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight men each evidently supplied with several muskets kept up a hot though useless fire on the loghouse  the four who had boarded made straight before them for the building shouting as they ran and the men among the trees shouted back to encourage them several shots were fired but such was the hurry of the marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect in a moment the four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us  the head of job anderson the boatswain appeared at the middle loophole  at em all hands all hands he roared in a voice of thunder  at the same moment another pirate grasped hunters musket by the muzzle wrenched it from his hands plucked it through the loophole and with one stunning blow laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor meanwhile a third running unharmed all around the house appeared suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor  our position was utterly reversed a moment since we were firing under cover at an exposed enemy now it was we who lay uncovered and could not return a blow  the loghouse was full of smoke to which we owed our comparative safety cries and confusion the flashes and reports of pistolshots and one loud groan rang in my ears  out lads out and fight em in the open cutlasses cried the captain  i snatched a cutlass from the pile and someone at the same time snatching another gave me a cut across the knuckles which i hardly felt i dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight someone was close behind i knew not whom right in front the doctor was pursuing his assailant down the hill and just as my eyes fell upon him beat down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash across the face  round the house lads round the house cried the captain and even in the hurlyburly i perceived a change in his voice  mechanically i obeyed turned eastwards and with my cutlass raised ran round the corner of the house next moment i was face to face with anderson he roared aloud and his hanger went up above his head flashing in the sunlight i had not time to be afraid but as the blow still hung impending leaped in a trice upon one side and missing my foot in the soft sand rolled headlong down the slope  when i had first sallied from the door the other mutineers had been already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us one man in a red nightcap with his cutlass in his mouth had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across well so short had been the interval that when i found my feet again all was in the same posture the fellow with the red nightcap still halfway over another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade and yet in this breath of time the fight was over and the victory was ours  gray following close behind me had cut down the big boatswain ere he had time to recover from his last blow another had been shot at a loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony the pistol still smoking in his hand a third as i had seen the doctor had disposed of at a blow of the four who had scaled the palisade one only remained unaccounted for and he having left his cutlass on the field was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him  fire fire from the house cried the doctor and you lads back into cover  but his words were unheeded no shot was fired and the last boarder made good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood in three seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who had fallen four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade  the doctor and gray and i ran full speed for shelter the survivors would soon be back where they had left their muskets and at any moment the fire might recommence  the house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke and we saw at a glance the price we had paid for victory hunter lay beside his loophole stunned joyce by his shot through the head never to move again while right in the centre the squire was supporting the captain one as pale as the other  the captains wounded said mr trelawney  have they run asked mr smollett  all that could you may be bound returned the doctor but theres five of them will never run again  five cried the captain come thats better five against three leaves us four to nine thats better odds than we had at starting we were seven to nineteen then or thought we were and thats as bad to bear   the mutineers were soon only eight in number for the man shot by mr trelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of his wound but this was of course not known till after by the faithful party     part five my sea adventure     xxii how i began my sea adventure   there was no return of the mutineers not so much as another shot out of the woods they had got their rations for that day as the captain put it and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the wounded and get dinner squire and i cooked outside in spite of the danger and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at for horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctors patients  out of the eight men who had fallen in the action only three still breathed that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole hunter and captain smollett and of these the first two were as good as dead the mutineer indeed died under the doctors knife and hunter do what we could never recovered consciousness in this world he lingered all day breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling and some time in the following night without sign or sound he went to his maker  as for the captain his wounds were grievous indeed but not dangerous no organ was fatally injured andersons ball for it was job that shot him first had broken his shoulderblade and touched the lung not badly the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf he was sure to recover the doctor said but in the meantime and for weeks to come he must not walk nor move his arm nor so much as speak when he could help it  my own accidental cut across the knuckles was a fleabite doctor livesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me into the bargain  after dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captains side awhile in consultation and when they had talked to their hearts content it being then a little past noon the doctor took up his hat and pistols girt on a cutlass put the chart in his pocket and with a musket over his shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly through the trees  gray and i were sitting together at the far end of the block house to be out of earshot of our officers consulting and gray took his pipe out of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again so thunderstruck he was at this occurrence  why in the name of davy jones said he is dr livesey mad  why no says i hes about the last of this crew for that i take it  well shipmate said gray mad he may not be but if hes not you mark my words i am  i take it replied i the doctor has his idea and if i am right hes going now to see ben gunn  i was right as appeared later but in the meantime the house being stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze with midday sun i began to get another thought into my head which was not by any means so right what i began to do was to envy the doctor walking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the pleasant smell of the pines while i sat grilling with my clothes stuck to the hot resin and so much blood about me and so many poor dead bodies lying all around that i took a disgust of the place that was almost as strong as fear  all the time i was washing out the block house and then washing up the things from dinner this disgust and envy kept growing stronger and stronger till at last being near a breadbag and no one then observing me i took the first step towards my escapade and filled both pockets of my coat with biscuit  i was a fool if you like and certainly i was going to do a foolish overbold act but i was determined to do it with all the precautions in my power these biscuits should anything befall me would keep me at least from starving till far on in the next day  the next thing i laid hold of was a brace of pistols and as i already had a powderhorn and bullets i felt myself well supplied with arms  as for the scheme i had in my head it was not a bad one in itself i was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east from the open sea find the white rock i had observed last evening and ascertain whether it was there or not that ben gunn had hidden his boat a thing quite worth doing as i still believe but as i was certain i should not be allowed to leave the enclosure my only plan was to take french leave and slip out when nobody was watching and that was so bad a way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong but i was only a boy and i had made my mind up  well as things at last fell out i found an admirable opportunity the squire and gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages the coast was clear i made a bolt for it over the stockade and into the thickest of the trees and before my absence was observed i was out of cry of my companions  this was my second folly far worse than the first as i left but two sound men to guard the house but like the first it was a help towards saving all of us  i took my way straight for the east coast of the island for i was determined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of observation from the anchorage it was already late in the afternoon although still warm and sunny as i continued to thread the tall woods i could hear from far before me not only the continuous thunder of the surf but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of boughs which showed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual soon cool draughts of air began to reach me and a few steps farther i came forth into the open borders of the grove and saw the sea lying blue and sunny to the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the beach  i have never seen the sea quiet round treasure island the sun might blaze overhead the air be without a breath the surface smooth and blue but still these great rollers would be running along all the external coast thundering and thundering by day and night and i scarce believe there is one spot in the island where a man would be out of earshot of their noise  i walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment till thinking i was now got far enough to the south i took the cover of some thick bushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit  behind me was the sea in front the anchorage the sea breeze as though it had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual violence was already at an end it had been succeeded by light variable airs from the south and southeast carrying great banks of fog and the anchorage under lee of skeleton island lay still and leaden as when first we entered it the hispaniola in that unbroken mirror was exactly portrayed from the truck to the waterline the jolly roger hanging from her peak  alongside lay one of the gigs silver in the sternsheets him i could always recognize while a couple of men were leaning over the stern bulwarks one of them with a red cap the very rogue that i had seen some hours before stridelegs upon the palisade apparently they were talking and laughing though at that distance upwards of a mile i could of course hear no word of what was said all at once there began the most horrid unearthly screaming which at first startled me badly though i had soon remembered the voice of captain flint and even thought i could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon her masters wrist  soon after the jollyboat shoved off and pulled for shore and the man with the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin companion  just about the same time the sun had gone down behind the spyglass and as the fog was collecting rapidly it began to grow dark in earnest i saw i must lose no time if i were to find the boat that evening  the white rock visible enough above the brush was still some eighth of a mile further down the spit and it took me a goodish while to get up with it crawling often on all fours among the scrub night had almost come when i laid my hand on its rough sides right below it there was an exceedingly small hollow of green turf hidden by banks and a thick underwood about kneedeep that grew there very plentifully and in the centre of the dell sure enough a little tent of goatskins like what the gipsies carry about with them in england  i dropped into the hollow lifted the side of the tent and there was ben gunns boat homemade if ever anything was homemade a rude lopsided framework of tough wood and stretched upon that a covering of goatskin with the hair inside the thing was extremely small even for me and i can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a fullsized man there was one thwart set as low as possible a kind of stretcher in the bows and a double paddle for propulsion  i had not then seen a coracle such as the ancient britons made but i have seen one since and i can give you no fairer idea of ben gunns boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever made by man but the great advantage of the coracle it certainly possessed for it was exceedingly light and portable  well now that i had found the boat you would have thought i had had enough of truantry for once but in the meantime i had taken another notion and become so obstinately fond of it that i would have carried it out i believe in the teeth of captain smollett himself this was to slip out under cover of the night cut the hispaniola adrift and let her go ashore where she fancied i had quite made up my mind that the mutineers after their repulse of the morning had nothing nearer their hearts than to up anchor and away to sea this i thought it would be a fine thing to prevent and now that i had seen how they left their watchmen unprovided with a boat i thought it might be done with little risk  down i sat to wait for darkness and made a hearty meal of biscuit it was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose the fog had now buried all heaven as the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared absolute blackness settled down on treasure island and when at last i shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow where i had supped there were but two points visible on the whole anchorage  one was the great fire on shore by which the defeated pirates lay carousing in the swamp the other a mere blur of light upon the darkness indicated the position of the anchored ship she had swung round to the ebb her bow was now towards me the only lights on board were in the cabin and what i saw was merely a reflection on the fog of the strong rays that flowed from the stern window  the ebb had already run some time and i had to wade through a long belt of swampy sand where i sank several times above the ankle before i came to the edge of the retreating water and wading a little way in with some strength and dexterity set my coracle keel downwards on the surface     xxiii the ebbtide runs   the coracle as i had ample reason to know before i was done with her was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight both buoyant and clever in a seaway but she was the most crossgrained lopsided craft to manage do as you pleased she always made more leeway than anything else and turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at even ben gunn himself has admitted that she was queer to handle till you knew her way  certainly i did not know her way she turned in every direction but the one i was bound to go the most part of the time we were broadside on and i am very sure i never should have made the ship at all but for the tide by good fortune paddle as i pleased the tide was still sweeping me down and there lay the hispaniola right in the fairway hardly to be missed  first she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than darkness then her spars and hull began to take shape and the next moment as it seemed for the farther i went the brisker grew the current of the ebb i was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold  the hawser was as taut as a bowstring and the current so strong she pulled upon her anchor all round the hull in the blackness the rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream one cut with my seagully and the hispaniola would go humming down the tide  so far so good but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut hawser suddenly cut is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse ten to one if i were so foolhardy as to cut the hispaniola from her anchor i and the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water  this brought me to a full stop and if fortune had not again particularly favoured me i should have had to abandon my design but the light airs which had begun blowing from the southeast and south had hauled round after nightfall into the southwest just while i was meditating a puff came caught the hispaniola and forced her up into the current and to my great joy i felt the hawser slacken in my grasp and the hand by which i held it dip for a second under water  with that i made my mind up took out my gully opened it with my teeth and cut one strand after another till the vessel swung only by two then i lay quiet waiting to sever these last when the strain should be once more lightened by a breath of wind  all this time i had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin but to say truth my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts that i had scarcely given ear now however when i had nothing else to do i began to pay more heed  one i recognized for the coxswains israel hands that had been flints gunner in former days the other was of course my friend of the red nightcap both men were plainly the worse of drink and they were still drinking for even while i was listening one of them with a drunken cry opened the stern window and threw out something which i divined to be an empty bottle but they were not only tipsy it was plain that they were furiously angry oaths flew like hailstones and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as i thought was sure to end in blows but each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result  on shore i could see the glow of the great campfire burning warmly through the shoreside trees someone was singing a dull old droning sailors song with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer i had heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words        but one man of her crew alive      what put to sea with seventyfive  and i thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a company that had met such cruel losses in the morning but indeed from what i saw all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed on  at last the breeze came the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the dark i felt the hawser slacken once more and with a good tough effort cut the last fibres through  the breeze had but little action on the coracle and i was almost instantly swept against the bows of the hispaniola at the same time the schooner began to turn upon her heel spinning slowly end for end across the current  i wrought like a fiend for i expected every moment to be swamped and since i found i could not push the coracle directly off i now shoved straight astern at length i was clear of my dangerous neighbour and just as i gave the last impulsion my hands came across a light cord that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks instantly i grasped it  why i should have done so i can hardly say it was at first mere instinct but once i had it in my hands and found it fast curiosity began to get the upper hand and i determined i should have one look through the cabin window  i pulled in hand over hand on the cord and when i judged myself near enough rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin  by this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty swiftly through the water indeed we had already fetched up level with the campfire the ship was talking as sailors say loudly treading the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash and until i got my eye above the windowsill i could not comprehend why the watchmen had taken no alarm one glance however was sufficient and it was only one glance that i durst take from that unsteady skiff it showed me hands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle each with a hand upon the others throat  i dropped upon the thwart again none too soon for i was near overboard i could see nothing for the moment but these two furious encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp and i shut my eyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness  the endless ballad had come to an end at last and the whole diminished company about the campfire had broken into the chorus i had heard so often             fifteen men on the dead mans chest                yohoho and a bottle of rum            drink and the devil had done for the rest                yohoho and a bottle of rum  i was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that very moment in the cabin of the hispaniola when i was surprised by a sudden lurch of the coracle at the same moment she yawed sharply and seemed to change her course the speed in the meantime had strangely increased  i opened my eyes at once all round me were little ripples combing over with a sharp bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent the hispaniola herself a few yards in whose wake i was still being whirled along seemed to stagger in her course and i saw her spars toss a little against the blackness of the night nay as i looked longer i made sure she also was wheeling to the southward  i glanced over my shoulder and my heart jumped against my ribs there right behind me was the glow of the campfire the current had turned at right angles sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and the little dancing coracle ever quickening ever bubbling higher ever muttering louder it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea  suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw turning perhaps through twenty degrees and almost at the same moment one shout followed another from on board i could hear feet pounding on the companion ladder and i knew that the two drunkards had at last been interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster  i lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and devoutly recommended my spirit to its maker at the end of the straits i made sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers where all my troubles would be ended speedily and though i could perhaps bear to die i could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached  so i must have lain for hours continually beaten to and fro upon the billows now and again wetted with flying sprays and never ceasing to expect death at the next plunge gradually weariness grew upon me a numbness an occasional stupor fell upon my mind even in the midst of my terrors until sleep at last supervened and in my seatossed coracle i lay and dreamed of home and the old admiral benbow     xxiv the cruise of the coracle   it was broad day when i awoke and found myself tossing at the southwest end of treasure island the sun was up but was still hid from me behind the great bulk of the spyglass which on this side descended almost to the sea in formidable cliffs  haulbowline head and mizzenmast hill were at my elbow the hill bare and dark the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high and fringed with great masses of fallen rock i was scarce a quarter of a mile to seaward and it was my first thought to paddle in and land  that notion was soon given over among the fallen rocks the breakers spouted and bellowed loud reverberations heavy sprays flying and falling succeeded one another from second to second and i saw myself if i ventured nearer dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending my strength in vain to scale the beetling crags  nor was that all for crawling together on flat tables of rock or letting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports i beheld huge slimy monsters soft snails as it were of incredible bigness two or three score of them together making the rocks to echo with their barkings  i have understood since that they were sea lions and entirely harmless but the look of them added to the difficulty of the shore and the high running of the surf was more than enough to disgust me of that landingplace i felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront such perils  in the meantime i had a better chance as i supposed before me north of haulbowline head the land runs in a long way leaving at low tide a long stretch of yellow sand to the north of that again there comes another cape cape of the woods as it was marked upon the chart buried in tall green pines which descended to the margin of the sea  i remembered what silver had said about the current that sets northward along the whole west coast of treasure island and seeing from my position that i was already under its influence i preferred to leave haulbowline head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to land upon the kindlierlooking cape of the woods  there was a great smooth swell upon the sea the wind blowing steady and gentle from the south there was no contrariety between that and the current and the billows rose and fell unbroken  had it been otherwise i must long ago have perished but as it was it is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat could ride often as i still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye above the gunwale i would see a big blue summit heaving close above me yet the coracle would but bounce a little dance as if on springs and subside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird  i began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill at paddling but even a small change in the disposition of the weight will produce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle and i had hardly moved before the boat giving up at once her gentle dancing movement ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy and struck her nose with a spout of spray deep into the side of the next wave  i was drenched and terrified and fell instantly back into my old position whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led me as softly as before among the billows it was plain she was not to be interfered with and at that rate since i could in no way influence her course what hope had i left of reaching land  i began to be horribly frightened but i kept my head for all that first moving with all care i gradually baled out the coracle with my seacap then getting my eye once more above the gunwale i set myself to study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers  i found each wave instead of the big smooth glossy mountain it looks from shore or from a vessels deck was for all the world like any range of hills on dry land full of peaks and smooth places and valleys the coracle left to herself turning from side to side threaded so to speak her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes and higher toppling summits of the wave  well now thought i to myself it is plain i must lie where i am and not disturb the balance but it is plain also that i can put the paddle over the side and from time to time in smooth places give her a shove or two towards land no sooner thought upon than done there i lay on my elbows in the most trying attitude and every now and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore  it was very tiring and slow work yet i did visibly gain ground and as we drew near the cape of the woods though i saw i must infallibly miss that point i had still made some hundred yards of easting i was indeed close in i could see the cool green treetops swaying together in the breeze and i felt sure i should make the next promontory without fail  it was high time for i now began to be tortured with thirst the glow of the sun from above its thousandfold reflection from the waves the seawater that fell and dried upon me caking my very lips with salt combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache the sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing but the current had soon carried me past the point and as the next reach of sea opened out i beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts  right in front of me not half a mile away i beheld the hispaniola under sail i made sure of course that i should be taken but i was so distressed for want of water that i scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought and long before i had come to a conclusion surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and i could do nothing but stare and wonder  the hispaniola was under her mainsail and two jibs and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver when i first sighted her all her sails were drawing she was lying a course about northwest and i presumed the men on board were going round the island on their way back to the anchorage presently she began to fetch more and more to the westward so that i thought they had sighted me and were going about in chase at last however she fell right into the winds eye was taken dead aback and stood there awhile helpless with her sails shivering  clumsy fellows said i they must still be drunk as owls and i thought how captain smollett would have set them skipping  meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another tack sailed swiftly for a minute or so and brought up once more dead in the winds eye again and again was this repeated to and fro up and down north south east and west the hispaniola sailed by swoops and dashes and at each repetition ended as she had begun with idly flapping canvas it became plain to me that nobody was steering and if so where were the men either they were dead drunk or had deserted her i thought and perhaps if i could get on board i might return the vessel to her captain  the current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate as for the latters sailing it was so wild and intermittent and she hung each time so long in irons that she certainly gained nothing if she did not even lose if only i dared to sit up and paddle i made sure that i could overhaul her the scheme had an air of adventure that inspired me and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore companion doubled my growing courage  up i got was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray but this time stuck to my purpose and set myself with all my strength and caution to paddle after the unsteered hispaniola once i shipped a sea so heavy that i had to stop and bail with my heart fluttering like a bird but gradually i got into the way of the thing and guided my coracle among the waves with only now and then a blow upon her bows and a dash of foam in my face  i was now gaining rapidly on the schooner i could see the brass glisten on the tiller as it banged about and still no soul appeared upon her decks i could not choose but suppose she was deserted if not the men were lying drunk below where i might batten them down perhaps and do what i chose with the ship  for some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for me standing still she headed nearly due south yawing of course all the time each time she fell off her sails partly filled and these brought her in a moment right to the wind again i have said this was the worst thing possible for me for helpless as she looked in this situation with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling and banging on the deck she still continued to run away from me not only with the speed of the current but by the whole amount of her leeway which was naturally great  but now at last i had my chance the breeze fell for some seconds very low and the current gradually turning her the hispaniola revolved slowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern with the cabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning on into the day the mainsail hung drooped like a banner she was stockstill but for the current  for the last little while i had even lost but now redoubling my efforts i began once more to overhaul the chase  i was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap she filled on the port tack and was off again stooping and skimming like a swallow  my first impulse was one of despair but my second was towards joy round she came till she was broadside on to me round still till she had covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the distance that separated us i could see the waves boiling white under her forefoot immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the coracle  and then of a sudden i began to comprehend i had scarce time to think scarce time to act and save myself i was on the summit of one swell when the schooner came stooping over the next the bowsprit was over my head i sprang to my feet and leaped stamping the coracle under water with one hand i caught the jibboom while my foot was lodged between the stay and the brace and as i still clung there panting a dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the coracle and that i was left without retreat on the hispaniola     xxv i strike the jolly roger   i had scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib flapped and filled upon the other tack with a report like a gun the schooner trembled to her keel under the reverse but next moment the other sails still drawing the jib flapped back again and hung idle  this had nearly tossed me off into the sea and now i lost no time crawled back along the bowsprit and tumbled head foremost on the deck  i was on the lee side of the forecastle and the mainsail which was still drawing concealed from me a certain portion of the afterdeck not a soul was to be seen the planks which had not been swabbed since the mutiny bore the print of many feet and an empty bottle broken by the neck tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers  suddenly the hispaniola came right into the wind the jibs behind me cracked aloud the rudder slammed to the whole ship gave a sickening heave and shudder and at the same moment the mainboom swung inboard the sheet groaning in the blocks and showed me the lee afterdeck  there were the two watchmen sure enough  redcap on his back as stiff as a handspike with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix and his teeth showing through his open lips israel hands propped against the bulwarks his chin on his chest his hands lying open before him on the deck his face as white under its tan as a tallow candle  for a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse the sails filling now on one tack now on another and the boom swinging to and fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain now and again too there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy blow of the ships bows against the swell so much heavier weather was made of it by this great rigged ship than by my homemade lopsided coracle now gone to the bottom of the sea  at every jump of the schooner redcap slipped to and fro but what was ghastly to behold neither his attitude nor his fixed teethdisclosing grin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage at every jump too hands appeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the deck his feet sliding ever the farther out and the whole body canting towards the stern so that his face became little by little hid from me and at last i could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayed ringlet of one whisker  at the same time i observed around both of them splashes of dark blood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each other in their drunken wrath  while i was thus looking and wondering in a calm moment when the ship was still israel hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhed himself back to the position in which i had seen him first the moan which told of pain and deadly weakness and the way in which his jaw hung open went right to my heart but when i remembered the talk i had overheard from the apple barrel all pity left me  i walked aft until i reached the mainmast  come aboard mr hands i said ironically  he rolled his eyes round heavily but he was too far gone to express surprise all he could do was to utter one word brandy  it occurred to me there was no time to lose and dodging the boom as it once more lurched across the deck i slipped aft and down the companion stairs into the cabin  it was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy all the lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart the floor was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after wading in the marshes round their camp the bulkheads all painted in clear white and beaded round with gilt bore a pattern of dirty hands dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of the ship one of the doctors medical books lay open on the table half of the leaves gutted out i suppose for pipelights in the midst of all this the lamp still cast a smoky glow obscure and brown as umber  i went into the cellar all the barrels were gone and of the bottles a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away certainly since the mutiny began not a man of them could ever have been sober  foraging about i found a bottle with some brandy left for hands and for myself i routed out some biscuit some pickled fruits a great bunch of raisins and a piece of cheese with these i came on deck put down my own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswains reach went forward to the waterbreaker and had a good deep drink of water and then and not till then gave hands the brandy  he must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth  aye said he by thunder but i wanted some o that  i had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat  much hurt i asked him  he grunted or rather i might say he barked  if that doctor was aboard he said id be right enough in a couple of turns but i dont have no manner of luck you see and thats whats the matter with me as for that swab hes good and dead he is he added indicating the man with the red cap he warnt no seaman anyhow and where mought you have come from  well said i ive come aboard to take possession of this ship mr hands and youll please regard me as your captain until further notice  he looked at me sourly enough but said nothing some of the colour had come back into his cheeks though he still looked very sick and still continued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about  by the by i continued i cant have these colours mr hands and by your leave ill strike em better none than these  and again dodging the boom i ran to the colour lines handed down their cursed black flag and chucked it overboard  god save the king said i waving my cap and theres an end to captain silver  he watched me keenly and slyly his chin all the while on his breast  i reckon he said at last i reckon capn hawkins youll kind of want to get ashore now spose we talks  why yes says i with all my heart mr hands say on and i went back to my meal with a good appetite  this man he began nodding feebly at the corpse  obrien were his name a rank irelander this man and me got the canvas on her meaning for to sail her back well hes dead now he is as dead as bilge and whos to sail this ship i dont see without i gives you a hint you aint that man as fars i can tell now look here you gives me food and drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up you do and ill tell you how to sail her and thats about square all round i take it  ill tell you one thing says i  im not going back to captain kidds anchorage i mean to get into north inlet and beach her quietly there  to be sure you did he cried why i aint sich an infernal lubber after all i can see cant i ive tried my fling i have and ive lost and its you has the wind of me north inlet why i havent no chice not i id help you sail her up to execution dock by thunder so i would  well as it seemed to me there was some sense in this we struck our bargain on the spot in three minutes i had the hispaniola sailing easily before the wind along the coast of treasure island with good hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as far as north inlet before high water when we might beach her safely and wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land  then i lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest where i got a soft silk handkerchief of my mothers with this and with my aid hands bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh and after he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy he began to pick up visibly sat straighter up spoke louder and clearer and looked in every way another man  the breeze served us admirably we skimmed before it like a bird the coast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low sandy country sparsely dotted with dwarf pines and soon we were beyond that again and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the north  i was greatly elated with my new command and pleased with the bright sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast i had now plenty of water and good things to eat and my conscience which had smitten me hard for my desertion was quieted by the great conquest i had made i should i think have had nothing left me to desire but for the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face it was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weakness a haggard old mans smile but there was besides that a grain of derision a shadow of treachery in his expression as he craftily watched and watched and watched me at my work     xxvi israel hands   the wind serving us to a desire now hauled into the west we could run so much the easier from the northeast corner of the island to the mouth of the north inlet only as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther time hung on our hands the coxswain told me how to lay the ship to after a good many trials i succeeded and we both sat in silence over another meal  capn said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile heres my old shipmate obrien spose you was to heave him overboard i aint particlar as a rule and i dont take no blame for settling his hash but i dont reckon him ornamental now do you  im not strong enough and i dont like the job and there he lies for me said i  this heres an unlucky ship this hispaniola jim he went on blinking theres a power of men been killed in this hispaniola a sight o poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to bristol i never seen sich dirty luck not i there was this here obrien now hes dead aint he well now im no scholar and youre a lad as can read and figure and to put it straight do you take it as a dead man is dead for good or do he come alive again  you can kill the body mr hands but not the spirit you must know that already i replied obrien there is in another world and may be watching us  ah says he well thats unfortnate appears as if killing parties was a waste of time howsomever sperrits dont reckon for much by what ive seen ill chance it with the sperrits jim and now youve spoke up free and ill take it kind if youd step down into that there cabin and get me a well a shiver my timbers i cant hit the name on t well you get me a bottle of wine jim this here brandys too strong for my head  now the coxswains hesitation seemed to be unnatural and as for the notion of his preferring wine to brandy i entirely disbelieved it the whole story was a pretext he wanted me to leave the deck so much was plain but with what purpose i could in no way imagine his eyes never met mine they kept wandering to and fro up and down now with a look to the sky now with a flitting glance upon the dead obrien all the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty embarrassed manner so that a child could have told that he was bent on some deception i was prompt with my answer however for i saw where my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid i could easily conceal my suspicions to the end  some wine i said far better will you have white or red  well i reckon its about the blessed same to me shipmate he replied so its strong and plenty of it whats the odds  all right i answered ill bring you port mr hands but ill have to dig for it  with that i scuttled down the companion with all the noise i could slipped off my shoes ran quietly along the sparred gallery mounted the forecastle ladder and popped my head out of the fore companion i knew he would not expect to see me there yet i took every precaution possible and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true  he had risen from his position to his hands and knees and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved for i could hear him stifle a groan yet it was at a good rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck in half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked out of a coil of rope a long knife or rather a short dirk discoloured to the hilt with blood he looked upon it for a moment thrusting forth his under jaw tried the point upon his hand and then hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark  this was all that i required to know israel could move about he was now armed and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me it was plain that i was meant to be the victim what he would do afterwards whether he would try to crawl right across the island from north inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire long tom trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him was of course more than i could say  yet i felt sure that i could trust him in one point since in that our interests jumped together and that was in the disposition of the schooner we both desired to have her stranded safe enough in a sheltered place and so that when the time came she could be got off again with as little labour and danger as might be and until that was done i considered that my life would certainly be spared  while i was thus turning the business over in my mind i had not been idle with my body i had stolen back to the cabin slipped once more into my shoes and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine and now with this for an excuse i made my reappearance on the deck  hands lay as i had left him all fallen together in a bundle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light he looked up however at my coming knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often and took a good swig with his favourite toast of heres luck then he lay quiet for a little and then pulling out a stick of tobacco begged me to cut him a quid  cut me a junk o that says he for i havent no knife and hardly strength enough so be as i had ah jim jim i reckon ive missed stays cut me a quid asll likely be the last lad for im for my long home and no mistake  well said i ill cut you some tobacco but if i was you and thought myself so badly i would go to my prayers like a christian man  why said he now you tell me why  why i cried you were asking me just now about the dead youve broken your trust youve lived in sin and lies and blood theres a man you killed lying at your feet this moment and you ask me why for gods mercy mr hands thats why  i spoke with a little heat thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket and designed in his ill thoughts to end me with he for his part took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most unusual solemnity  for thirty years he said ive sailed the seas and seen good and bad better and worse fair weather and foul provisions running out knives going and what not well now i tell you i never seen good come o goodness yet him as strikes first is my fancy dead men dont bite thems my views amen so be it and now you look here he added suddenly changing his tone weve had about enough of this foolery the tides made good enough by now you just take my orders capn hawkins and well sail slap in and be done with it  all told we had scarce two miles to run but the navigation was delicate the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow and shoal but lay east and west so that the schooner must be nicely handled to be got in i think i was a good prompt subaltern and i am very sure that hands was an excellent pilot for we went about and about and dodged in shaving the banks with a certainty and a neatness that were a pleasure to behold  scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us the shores of north inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern anchorage but the space was longer and narrower and more like what in truth it was the estuary of a river right before us at the southern end we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation it had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of dripping seaweed and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and now flourished thick with flowers it was a sad sight but it showed us that the anchorage was calm  now said hands look there theres a pet bit for to beach a ship in fine flat sand never a cats paw trees all around of it and flowers ablowing like a garding on that old ship  and once beached i inquired how shall we get her off again  why so he replied  you take a line ashore there on the other side at low water take a turn about one of them big pines bring it back take a turn around the capstan and lie to for the tide come high water all hands take a pull upon the line and off she comes as sweet as natur and now boy you stand by were near the bit now and shes too much way on her starboard a little so steady starboard larboard a little steady steady  so he issued his commands which i breathlessly obeyed till all of a sudden he cried now my hearty luff and i put the helm hard up and the hispaniola swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low wooded shore  the excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the watch i had kept hitherto sharply enough upon the coxswain even then i was still so much interested waiting for the ship to touch that i had quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before the bows i might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head perhaps i had heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye perhaps it was an instinct like a cats but sure enough when i looked round there was hands already halfway towards me with the dirk in his right hand  we must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met but while mine was the shrill cry of terror his was a roar of fury like a charging bullys at the same instant he threw himself forward and i leapt sideways towards the bows as i did so i let go of the tiller which sprang sharp to leeward and i think this saved my life for it struck hands across the chest and stopped him for the moment dead  before he could recover i was safe out of the corner where he had me trapped with all the deck to dodge about just forward of the mainmast i stopped drew a pistol from my pocket took a cool aim though he had already turned and was once more coming directly after me and drew the trigger the hammer fell but there followed neither flash nor sound the priming was useless with seawater i cursed myself for my neglect why had not i long before reprimed and reloaded my only weapons then i should not have been as now a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher  wounded as he was it was wonderful how fast he could move his grizzled hair tumbling over his face and his face itself as red as a red ensign with his haste and fury i had no time to try my other pistol nor indeed much inclination for i was sure it would be useless one thing i saw plainly  i must not simply retreat before him or he would speedily hold me boxed into the bows as a moment since he had so nearly boxed me in the stern once so caught and nine or ten inches of the bloodstained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity i placed my palms against the mainmast which was of a goodish bigness and waited every nerve upon the stretch  seeing that i meant to dodge he also paused and a moment or two passed in feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine it was such a game as i had often played at home about the rocks of black hill cove but never before you may be sure with such a wildly beating heart as now still as i say it was a boys game and i thought i could hold my own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh indeed my courage had begun to rise so high that i allowed myself a few darting thoughts on what would be the end of the affair and while i saw certainly that i could spin it out for long i saw no hope of any ultimate escape  well while things stood thus suddenly the hispaniola struck staggered ground for an instant in the sand and then swift as a blow canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle of fortyfive degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the scupper holes and lay in a pool between the deck and bulwark  we were both of us capsized in a second and both of us rolled almost together into the scuppers the dead redcap with his arms still spread out tumbling stiffly after us so near were we indeed that my head came against the coxswains foot with a crack that made my teeth rattle blow and all i was the first afoot again for hands had got involved with the dead body the sudden canting of the ship had made the deck no place for running on i had to find some new way of escape and that upon the instant for my foe was almost touching me quick as thought i sprang into the mizzen shrouds rattled up hand over hand and did not draw a breath till i was seated on the crosstrees  i had been saved by being prompt the dirk had struck not half a foot below me as i pursued my upward flight and there stood israel hands with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine a perfect statue of surprise and disappointment  now that i had a moment to myself i lost no time in changing the priming of my pistol and then having one ready for service and to make assurance doubly sure i proceeded to draw the load of the other and recharge it afresh from the beginning  my new employment struck hands all of a heap he began to see the dice going against him and after an obvious hesitation he also hauled himself heavily into the shrouds and with the dirk in his teeth began slowly and painfully to mount it cost him no end of time and groans to haul his wounded leg behind him and i had quietly finished my arrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up then with a pistol in either hand i addressed him  one more step mr hands said i and ill blow your brains out dead men dont bite you know i added with a chuckle  he stopped instantly i could see by the working of his face that he was trying to think and the process was so slow and laborious that in my newfound security i laughed aloud at last with a swallow or two he spoke his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity in order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth but in all else he remained unmoved  jim says he i reckon were fouled you and me and well have to sign articles id have had you but for that there lurch but i dont have no luck not i and i reckon ill have to strike which comes hard you see for a master mariner to a ships younker like you jim  i was drinking in his words and smiling away as conceited as a cock upon a wall when all in a breath back went his right hand over his shoulder something sang like an arrow through the air i felt a blow and then a sharp pang and there i was pinned by the shoulder to the mast in the horrid pain and surprise of the moment i scarce can say it was by my own volition and i am sure it was without a conscious aim both my pistols went off and both escaped out of my hands they did not fall alone with a choked cry the coxswain loosed his grasp upon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water     xxvii pieces of eight   owing to the cant of the vessel the masts hung far out over the water and from my perch on the crosstrees i had nothing below me but the surface of the bay hands who was not so far up was in consequence nearer to the ship and fell between me and the bulwarks he rose once to the surface in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good as the water settled i could see him lying huddled together on the clean bright sand in the shadow of the vessels sides a fish or two whipped past his body sometimes by the quivering of the water he appeared to move a little as if he were trying to rise but he was dead enough for all that being both shot and drowned and was food for fish in the very place where he had designed my slaughter  i was no sooner certain of this than i began to feel sick faint and terrified the hot blood was running over my back and chest the dirk where it had pinned my shoulder to the mast seemed to burn like a hot iron yet it was not so much these real sufferings that distressed me for these it seemed to me i could bear without a murmur it was the horror i had upon my mind of falling from the crosstrees into that still green water beside the body of the coxswain  i clung with both hands till my nails ached and i shut my eyes as if to cover up the peril gradually my mind came back again my pulses quieted down to a more natural time and i was once more in possession of myself  it was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk but either it stuck too hard or my nerve failed me and i desisted with a violent shudder oddly enough that very shudder did the business the knife in fact had come the nearest in the world to missing me altogether it held me by a mere pinch of skin and this the shudder tore away the blood ran down the faster to be sure but i was my own master again and only tacked to the mast by my coat and shirt  these last i broke through with a sudden jerk and then regained the deck by the starboard shrouds for nothing in the world would i have again ventured shaken as i was upon the overhanging port shrouds from which israel had so lately fallen  i went below and did what i could for my wound it pained me a good deal and still bled freely but it was neither deep nor dangerous nor did it greatly gall me when i used my arm then i looked around me and as the ship was now in a sense my own i began to think of clearing it from its last passenger the dead man obrien  he had pitched as i have said against the bulwarks where he lay like some horrible ungainly sort of puppet lifesize indeed but how different from lifes colour or lifes comeliness in that position i could easily have my way with him and as the habit of tragical adventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead i took him by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave tumbled him overboard he went in with a sounding plunge the red cap came off and remained floating on the surface and as soon as the splash subsided i could see him and israel lying side by side both wavering with the tremulous movement of the water obrien though still quite a young man was very bald there he lay with that bald head across the knees of the man who had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and fro over both  i was now alone upon the ship the tide had just turned the sun was within so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the pines upon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorage and fall in patterns on the deck the evening breeze had sprung up and though it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the east the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and the idle sails to rattle to and fro  i began to see a danger to the ship the jibs i speedily doused and brought tumbling to the deck but the mainsail was a harder matter of course when the schooner canted over the boom had swung outboard and the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water i thought this made it still more dangerous yet the strain was so heavy that i half feared to meddle at last i got my knife and cut the halyards the peak dropped instantly a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon the water and since pull as i liked i could not budge the downhall that was the extent of what i could accomplish for the rest the hispaniola must trust to luck like myself  by this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadow the last rays i remember falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright as jewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck it began to be chill the tide was rapidly fleeting seaward the schooner settling more and more on her beamends  i scrambled forward and looked over it seemed shallow enough and holding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security i let myself drop softly overboard the water scarcely reached my waist the sand was firm and covered with ripple marks and i waded ashore in great spirits leaving the hispaniola on her side with her mainsail trailing wide upon the surface of the bay about the same time the sun went fairly down and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines  at least and at last i was off the sea nor had i returned thence emptyhanded there lay the schooner clear at last from buccaneers and ready for our own men to board and get to sea again i had nothing nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my achievements possibly i might be blamed a bit for my truantry but the recapture of the hispaniola was a clenching answer and i hoped that even captain smollett would confess i had not lost my time  so thinking and in famous spirits i began to set my face homeward for the block house and my companions i remembered that the most easterly of the rivers which drain into captain kidds anchorage ran from the twopeaked hill upon my left and i bent my course in that direction that i might pass the stream while it was small the wood was pretty open and keeping along the lower spurs i had soon turned the corner of that hill and not long after waded to the midcalf across the watercourse  this brought me near to where i had encountered ben gunn the maroon and i walked more circumspectly keeping an eye on every side the dusk had come nigh hand completely and as i opened out the cleft between the two peaks i became aware of a wavering glow against the sky where as i judged the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring fire and yet i wondered in my heart that he should show himself so careless for if i could see this radiance might it not reach the eyes of silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes  gradually the night fell blacker it was all i could do to guide myself even roughly towards my destination the double hill behind me and the spyglass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter the stars were few and pale and in the low ground where i wandered i kept tripping among bushes and rolling into sandy pits  suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me i looked up a pale glimmer of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the spyglass and soon after i saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees and knew the moon had risen  with this to help me i passed rapidly over what remained to me of my journey and sometimes walking sometimes running impatiently drew near to the stockade yet as i began to thread the grove that lies before it i was not so thoughtless but that i slacked my pace and went a trifle warily it would have been a poor end of my adventures to get shot down by my own party in mistake  the moon was climbing higher and higher its light began to fall here and there in masses through the more open districts of the wood and right in front of me a glow of a different colour appeared among the trees it was red and hot and now and again it was a little darkened as it were the embers of a bonfire smouldering  for the life of me i could not think what it might be  at last i came right down upon the borders of the clearing the western end was already steeped in moonshine the rest and the block house itself still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks of light on the other side of the house an immense fire had burned itself into clear embers and shed a steady red reverberation contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon there was not a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze  i stopped with much wonder in my heart and perhaps a little terror also it had not been our way to build great fires we were indeed by the captains orders somewhat niggardly of firewood and i began to fear that something had gone wrong while i was absent  i stole round by the eastern end keeping close in shadow and at a convenient place where the darkness was thickest crossed the palisade  to make assurance surer i got upon my hands and knees and crawled without a sound towards the corner of the house as i drew nearer my heart was suddenly and greatly lightened it is not a pleasant noise in itself and i have often complained of it at other times but just then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and peaceful in their sleep the seacry of the watch that beautiful alls well never fell more reassuringly on my ear  in the meantime there was no doubt of one thing they kept an infamous bad watch if it had been silver and his lads that were now creeping in on them not a soul would have seen daybreak that was what it was thought i to have the captain wounded and again i blamed myself sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard  by this time i had got to the door and stood up all was dark within so that i could distinguish nothing by the eye as for sounds there was the steady drone of the snorers and a small occasional noise a flickering or pecking that i could in no way account for  with my arms before me i walked steadily in i should lie down in my own place i thought with a silent chuckle and enjoy their faces when they found me in the morning  my foot struck something yielding it was a sleepers leg and he turned and groaned but without awaking  and then all of a sudden a shrill voice broke forth out of the darkness   pieces of eight pieces of eight pieces of eight pieces of eight pieces of eight and so forth without pause or change like the clacking of a tiny mill  silvers green parrot captain flint it was she whom i had heard pecking at a piece of bark it was she keeping better watch than any human being who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain  i had no time left me to recover at the sharp clipping tone of the parrot the sleepers awoke and sprang up and with a mighty oath the voice of silver cried who goes  i turned to run struck violently against one person recoiled and ran full into the arms of a second who for his part closed upon and held me tight  bring a torch dick said silver when my capture was thus assured  and one of the men left the loghouse and presently returned with a lighted brand     part six captain silver     xxviii in the enemys camp   the red glare of the torch lighting up the interior of the block house showed me the worst of my apprehensions realized the pirates were in possession of the house and stores  there was the cask of cognac there were the pork and bread as before and what tenfold increased my horror not a sign of any prisoner i could only judge that all had perished and my heart smote me sorely that i had not been there to perish with them  there were six of the buccaneers all told not another man was left alive five of them were on their feet flushed and swollen suddenly called out of the first sleep of drunkenness the sixth had only risen upon his elbow he was deadly pale and the bloodstained bandage round his head told that he had recently been wounded and still more recently dressed i remembered the man who had been shot and had run back among the woods in the great attack and doubted not that this was he  the parrot sat preening her plumage on long johns shoulder he himself i thought looked somewhat paler and more stern than i was used to he still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had fulfilled his mission but it was bitterly the worse for wear daubed with clay and torn with the sharp briers of the wood  so said he heres jim hawkins shiver my timbers dropped in like eh well come i take that friendly  and thereupon he sat down across the brandy cask and began to fill a pipe  give me a loan of the link dick said he and then when he had a good light thatll do lad he added stick the glim in the wood heap and you gentlemen bring yourselves to you neednt stand up for mr hawkins hell excuse you you may lay to that and so jim stopping the tobacco here you were and quite a pleasant surprise for poor old john i see you were smart when first i set my eyes on you but this here gets away from me clean it do  to all this as may be well supposed i made no answer they had set me with my back against the wall and i stood there looking silver in the face pluckily enough i hope to all outward appearance but with black despair in my heart  silver took a whiff or two of his pipe with great composure and then ran on again  now you see jim so be as you are here says he ill give you a piece of my mind ive always liked you i have for a lad of spirit and the picter of my own self when i was young and handsome i always wanted you to jine and take your share and die a gentleman and now my cock youve got to capn smolletts a fine seaman as ill own up to any day but stiff on discipline dooty is dooty says he and right he is just you keep clear of the capn the doctor himself is gone dead again you ungrateful scamp was what he said and the short and the long of the whole story is about here  you cant go back to your own lot for they wont have you and without you start a third ships company all by yourself which might be lonely youll have to jine with capn silver  so far so good my friends then were still alive and though i partly believed the truth of silvers statement that the cabin party were incensed at me for my desertion i was more relieved than distressed by what i heard  i dont say nothing as to your being in our hands continued silver though there you are and you may lay to it im all for argyment i never seen good come out o threatening if you like the service well youll jine and if you dont jim why youre free to answer no free and welcome shipmate and if fairer can be said by mortal seaman shiver my sides  am i to answer then i asked with a very tremulous voice through all this sneering talk i was made to feel the threat of death that overhung me and my cheeks burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast  lad said silver no ones apressing of you take your bearings none of us wont hurry you mate time goes so pleasant in your company you see  well says i growing a bit bolder if im to choose i declare i have a right to know whats what and why youre here and where my friends are  wots wot repeated one of the buccaneers in a deep growl ah hed be a lucky one as knowed that  youll perhaps batten down your hatches till youre spoke to my friend cried silver truculently to this speaker and then in his first gracious tones he replied to me yesterday morning mr hawkins said he in the dogwatch down came doctor livesey with a flag of truce says he capn silver youre sold out ships gone well maybe wed been taking a glass and a song to help it round i wont say no leastways none of us had looked out we looked out and by thunder the old ship was gone i never seen a pack o fools look fishier and you may lay to that if i tells you that looked the fishiest well says the doctor lets bargain we bargained him and i and here we are  stores brandy block house the firewood you was thoughtful enough to cut and in a manner of speaking the whole blessed boat from crosstrees to kelson as for them theyve tramped i dont know wheres they are  he drew again quietly at his pipe  and lest you should take it into that head of yours he went on that you was included in the treaty heres the last word that was said  how many are you says i to leave four says he four and one of us wounded as for that boy i dont know where he is confound him says he nor i dont much care were about sick of him these was his words  is that all i asked  well its all that youre to hear my son returned silver  and now i am to choose  and now you are to choose and you may lay to that said silver  well said i i am not such a fool but i know pretty well what i have to look for let the worst come to the worst its little i care ive seen too many die since i fell in with you but theres a thing or two i have to tell you i said and by this time i was quite excited and the first is this  here you are in a bad way ship lost treasure lost men lost your whole business gone to wreck and if you want to know who did it it was i i was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land and i heard you john and you dick johnson and hands who is now at the bottom of the sea and told every word you said before the hour was out and as for the schooner it was i who cut her cable and it was i that killed the men you had aboard of her and it was i who brought her where youll never see her more not one of you the laughs on my side ive had the top of this business from the first i no more fear you than i fear a fly kill me if you please or spare me but one thing ill say and no more if you spare me bygones are bygones and when you fellows are in court for piracy ill save you all i can it is for you to choose kill another and do yourselves no good or spare me and keep a witness to save you from the gallows  i stopped for i tell you i was out of breath and to my wonder not a man of them moved but all sat staring at me like as many sheep and while they were still staring i broke out again and now mr silver  i said i believe youre the best man here and if things go to the worst ill take it kind of you to let the doctor know the way i took it  ill bear it in mind said silver with an accent so curious that i could not for the life of me decide whether he were laughing at my request or had been favourably affected by my courage  ill put one to that cried the old mahoganyfaced seaman morgan by name whom i had seen in long johns publichouse upon the quays of bristol it was him that knowed black dog  well and see here added the seacook ill put another again to that by thunder for it was this same boy that faked the chart from billy bones first and last weve split upon jim hawkins  then here goes said morgan with an oath  and he sprang up drawing his knife as if he had been twenty  avast there cried silver who are you tom morgan maybe you thought you was capn here perhaps by the powers but ill teach you better cross me and youll go where many a good mans gone before you first and last these thirty year back some to the yardarm shiver my timbers and some by the board and all to feed the fishes theres never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day aterwards tom morgan you may lay to that  morgan paused but a hoarse murmur rose from the others  toms right said one  i stood hazing long enough from one added another ill be hanged if ill be hazed by you john silver  did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with me roared silver bending far forward from his position on the keg with his pipe still glowing in his right hand put a name on what youre at you aint dumb i reckon him that wants shall get it have i lived this many years and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it you know the way youre all gentlemen o fortune by your account well im ready take a cutlass him that dares and ill see the colour of his inside crutch and all before that pipes empty  not a man stirred not a man answered  thats your sort is it he added returning his pipe to his mouth well youre a gay lot to look at anyway not much worth to fight you aint praps you can understand king georges english im capn here by lection im capn here because im the best man by a long seamile you wont fight as gentlemen o fortune should then by thunder youll obey and you may lay to it i like that boy now i never seen a better boy than that hes more a man than any pair of rats of you in this here house and what i say is this  let me see him thatll lay a hand on him thats what i say and you may lay to it  there was a long pause after this i stood straight up against the wall my heart still going like a sledgehammer but with a ray of hope now shining in my bosom silver leant back against the wall his arms crossed his pipe in the corner of his mouth as calm as though he had been in church yet his eye kept wandering furtively and he kept the tail of it on his unruly followers they on their part drew gradually together towards the far end of the block house and the low hiss of their whispering sounded in my ear continuously like a stream one after another they would look up and the red light of the torch would fall for a second on their nervous faces but it was not towards me it was towards silver that they turned their eyes  you seem to have a lot to say remarked silver spitting far into the air pipe up and let me hear it or lay to  ax your pardon sir returned one of the men youre pretty free with some of the rules maybe youll kindly keep an eye upon the rest this crews dissatisfied this crew dont vally bullying a marlinspike this crew has its rights like other crews ill make so free as that and by your own rules i take it we can talk together i ax your pardon sir acknowledging you for to be capting at this present but i claim my right and steps outside for a council  and with an elaborate seasalute this fellow a long illlooking yelloweyed man of five and thirty stepped coolly towards the door and disappeared out of the house one after another the rest followed his example each making a salute as he passed each adding some apology according to rules said one forecastle council said morgan and so with one remark or another all marched out and left silver and me alone with the torch  the seacook instantly removed his pipe  now look you here jim hawkins he said in a steady whisper that was no more than audible youre within half a plank of death and whats a long sight worse of torture theyre going to throw me off but you mark i stand by you through thick and thin i didnt mean to no not till you spoke up i was about desperate to lose that much blunt and be hanged into the bargain but i see you was the right sort i says to myself you stand by hawkins john and hawkinsll stand by you youre his last card and by the living thunder john hes yours back to back says i you save your witness and hell save your neck  i began dimly to understand  you mean alls lost i asked  aye by gum i do he answered ship gone neck gone thats the size of it once i looked into that bay jim hawkins and seen no schooner well im tough but i gave out as for that lot and their council mark me theyre outright fools and cowards ill save your life if so be as i can from them but see here jim tit for tat you save long john from swinging  i was bewildered it seemed a thing so hopeless he was asking he the old buccaneer the ringleader throughout  what i can do that ill do i said  its a bargain cried long john you speak up plucky and by thunder ive a chance  he hobbled to the torch where it stood propped among the firewood and took a fresh light to his pipe  understand me jim he said returning ive a head on my shoulders i have im on squires side now i know youve got that ship safe somewheres how you done it i dont know but safe it is i guess hands and obrien turned soft i never much believed in neither of them now you mark me i ask no questions nor i wont let others i know when a games up i do and i know a lad thats staunch ah you thats young you and me might have done a power of good together  he drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin  will you taste messmate he asked and when i had refused  well ill take a dram myself jim said he i need a caulker for theres trouble on hand and talking o trouble why did that doctor give me the chart jim  my face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of further questions  ah well he did though said he and theres something under that no doubt something surely under that jim bad or good  and he took another swallow of the brandy shaking his great fair head like a man who looks forward to the worst     xxix the black spot again   the council of buccaneers had lasted some time when one of them reentered the house and with a repetition of the same salute which had in my eyes an ironical air begged for a moments loan of the torch silver briefly agreed and this emissary retired again leaving us together in the dark  theres a breeze coming jim said silver who had by this time adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone  i turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out the embers of the great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and duskily that i understood why these conspirators desired a torch about halfway down the slope to the stockade they were collected in a group one held the light another was on his knees in their midst and i saw the blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in the moon and torchlight the rest were all somewhat stooping as though watching the manoeuvres of this last i could just make out that he had a book as well as a knife in his hand and was still wondering how anything so incongruous had come in their possession when the kneeling figure rose once more to his feet and the whole party began to move together towards the house  here they come said i and i returned to my former position for it seemed beneath my dignity that they should find me watching them  well let em come lad let em come said silver cheerily ive still a shot in my locker  the door opened and the five men standing huddled together just inside pushed one of their number forward in any other circumstances it would have been comical to see his slow advance hesitating as he set down each foot but holding his closed right hand in front of him  step up lad cried silver i wont eat you hand it over lubber i know the rules i do i wont hurt a depytation  thus encouraged the buccaneer stepped forth more briskly and having passed something to silver from hand to hand slipped yet more smartly back again to his companions  the seacook looked at what had been given him  the black spot i thought so he observed where might you have got the paper why hillo look here now this aint lucky youve gone and cut this out of a bible what fools cut a bible  ah there said morgan there wot did i say no goodll come o that i said  well youve about fixed it now among you continued silver youll all swing now i reckon what softheaded lubber had a bible  it was dick said one  dick was it then dick can get to prayers said silver hes seen his slice of luck has dick and you may lay to that  but here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in  belay that talk john silver he said this crew has tipped you the black spot in full council as in dooty bound just you turn it over as in dooty bound and see whats wrote there then you can talk  thanky george replied the seacook you always was brisk for business and has the rules by heart george as im pleased to see well what is it anyway ah deposed thats it is it very pretty wrote to be sure like print i swear your hand o write george why you was gettin quite a leadin man in this here crew youll be capn next i shouldnt wonder just oblige me with that torch again will you this pipe dont draw  come now said george you dont fool this crew no more youre a funny man by your account but youre over now and youll maybe step down off that barrel and help vote  i thought you said you knowed the rules returned silver contemptuously leastways if you dont i do and i wait here and im still your capn mind till you outs with your grievances and i reply in the meantime your black spot aint worth a biscuit after that well see  oh replied george you dont be under no kind of apprehension were all square we are first youve made a hash of this cruise youll be a bold man to say no to that second you let the enemy out o this here trap for nothing why did they want out i dunno but its pretty plain they wanted it third you wouldnt let us go at them upon the march oh we see through you john silver you want to play booty thats whats wrong with you and then fourth theres this here boy  is that all asked silver quietly  enough too retorted george well all swing and sundry for your bungling  well now look here ill answer these four pints one after another ill answer em i made a hash o this cruise did i well now you all know what i wanted and you all know if that had been done that wed a been aboard the hispaniola this night as ever was every man of us alive and fit and full of good plumduff and the treasure in the hold of her by thunder well who crossed me who forced my hand as was the lawful capn who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began this dance ah its a fine dance im with you there and looks mighty like a hornpipe in a ropes end at execution dock by london town it does but who done it why it was anderson and hands and you george merry and youre the last above board of that same meddling crew and you have the davy joness insolence to up and stand for capn over me you that sank the lot of us by the powers but this tops the stiffest yarn to nothing  silver paused and i could see by the faces of george and his late comrades that these words had not been said in vain  thats for number one cried the accused wiping the sweat from his brow for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook the house why i give you my word im sick to speak to you youve neither sense nor memory and i leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you come to sea sea gentlemen o fortune i reckon tailors is your trade  go on john said morgan speak up to the others  ah the others returned john theyre a nice lot aint they you say this cruise is bungled ah by gum if you could understand how bad its bungled you would see were that near the gibbet that my necks stiff with thinking on it youve seen em maybe hanged in chains birds about em seamen pinting em out as they go down with the tide whos that says one that why thats john silver i knowed him well says another and you can hear the chains ajangle as you go about and reach for the other buoy now thats about where we are every mothers son of us thanks to him and hands and anderson and other ruination fools of you and if you want to know about number four and that boy why shiver my timbers isnt he a hostage are we agoing to waste a hostage no not us he might be our last chance and i shouldnt wonder kill that boy not me mates and number three ah well theres a deal to say to number three maybe you dont count it nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day you john with your head broke or you george merry that had the ague shakes upon you not six hours agone and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel to this same moment on the clock and maybe perhaps you didnt know there was a consort coming either but there is and not so long till then and well see wholl be glad to have a hostage when it comes to that and as for number two and why i made a bargain well you came crawling on your knees to me to make it on your knees you came you was that downhearted and youd have starved too if i hadnt but thats a trifle you look there thats why  and he cast down upon the floor a paper that i instantly recognized none other than the chart on yellow paper with the three red crosses that i had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the captains chest why the doctor had given it to him was more than i could fancy  but if it were inexplicable to me the appearance of the chart was incredible to the surviving mutineers they leaped upon it like cats upon a mouse it went from hand to hand one tearing it from another and by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter with which they accompanied their examination you would have thought not only they were fingering the very gold but were at sea with it besides in safety  yes said one thats flint sure enough j f and a score below with a clove hitch to it so he done ever  mighty pretty said george but how are we to get away with it and us no ship  silver suddenly sprang up and supporting himself with a hand against the wall  now i give you warning george he cried one more word of your sauce and ill call you down and fight you how why how do i know you had ought to tell me that you and the rest that lost me my schooner with your interference burn you but not you you cant you haint got the invention of a cockroach but civil you can speak and shall george merry you may lay to that  thats fair enow said the old man morgan  fair i reckon so said the seacook you lost the ship i found the treasure whos the better man at that and now i resign by thunder elect whom you please to be your capn now im done with it  silver they cried barbecue forever barbecue for capn  so thats the toon is it cried the cook george i reckon youll have to wait another turn friend and lucky for you as im not a revengeful man but that was never my way and now shipmates this black spot taint much good now is it dicks crossed his luck and spoiled his bible and thats about all  itll do to kiss the book on still wont it growled dick who was evidently uneasy at the curse he had brought upon himself  a bible with a bit cut out returned silver derisively not it it dont bind no moren a balladbook  dont it though cried dick with a sort of joy well i reckon thats worth having too  here jim heres a curosity for you said silver and he tossed me the paper  it was around about the size of a crown piece one side was blank for it had been the last leaf the other contained a verse or two of revelation these words among the rest which struck sharply home upon my mind  without are dogs and murderers the printed side had been blackened with wood ash which already began to come off and soil my fingers on the blank side had been written with the same material the one word depposed i have that curiosity beside me at this moment but not a trace of writing now remains beyond a single scratch such as a man might make with his thumbnail  that was the end of the nights business soon after with a drink all round we lay down to sleep and the outside of silvers vengeance was to put george merry up for sentinel and threaten him with death if he should prove unfaithful  it was long ere i could close an eye and heaven knows i had matter enough for thought in the man whom i had slain that afternoon in my own most perilous position and above all in the remarkable game that i saw silver now engaged upon keeping the mutineers together with one hand and grasping with the other after every means possible and impossible to make his peace and save his miserable life he himself slept peacefully and snored aloud yet my heart was sore for him wicked as he was to think on the dark perils that environed and the shameful gibbet that awaited him     xxx on parole   i was wakened indeed we were all wakened for i could see even the sentinel shake himself together from where he had fallen against the doorpost by a clear hearty voice hailing us from the margin of the wood   block house ahoy it cried heres the doctor  and the doctor it was although i was glad to hear the sound yet my gladness was not without admixture i remembered with confusion my insubordinate and stealthy conduct and when i saw where it had brought me among what companions and surrounded by what dangers i felt ashamed to look him in the face  he must have risen in the dark for the day had hardly come and when i ran to a loophole and looked out i saw him standing like silver once before up to the midleg in creeping vapour  you doctor top o the morning to you sir cried silver broad awake and beaming with good nature in a moment bright and early to be sure and its the early bird as the saying goes that gets the rations george shake up your timbers son and help dr livesey over the ships side all adoin well your patients was all well and merry  so he pattered on standing on the hilltop with his crutch under his elbow and one hand upon the side of the loghouse quite the old john in voice manner and expression  weve quite a surprise for you too sir he continued weve a little stranger here he he a noo boarder and lodger sir and looking fit and taut as a fiddle slep like a supercargo he did right alongside of john stem to stem we was all night  dr livesey was by this time across the stockade and pretty near the cook and i could hear the alteration in his voice as he said not jim  the very same jim as ever was says silver  the doctor stopped outright although he did not speak and it was some seconds before he seemed able to move on  well well he said at last duty first and pleasure afterwards as you might have said yourself silver let us overhaul these patients of yours  a moment afterwards he had entered the block house and with one grim nod to me proceeded with his work among the sick he seemed under no apprehension though he must have known that his life among these treacherous demons depended on a hair and he rattled on to his patients as if he were paying an ordinary professional visit in a quiet english family his manner i suppose reacted on the men for they behaved to him as if nothing had occurred as if he were still ships doctor and they still faithful hands before the mast  youre doing well my friend he said to the fellow with the bandaged head and if ever any person had a close shave it was you your head must be as hard as iron well george how goes it youre a pretty colour certainly why your liver man is upside down did you take that medicine did he take that medicine men  aye aye sir he took it sure enough returned morgan  because you see since i am mutineers doctor or prison doctor as i prefer to call it says doctor livesey in his pleasantest way i make it a point of honour not to lose a man for king george god bless him and the gallows  the rogues looked at each other but swallowed the homethrust in silence  dick dont feel well sir said one  dont he replied the doctor well step up here dick and let me see your tongue no i should be surprised if he did the mans tongue is fit to frighten the french another fever  ah there said morgan that comed of spiling bibles  that comes as you call it of being arrant asses retorted the doctor and not having sense enough to know honest air from poison and the dry land from a vile pestiferous slough i think it most probable though of course its only an opinion that youll all have the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems camp in a bog would you silver im surprised at you youre less of a fool than many take you all round but you dont appear to me to have the rudiments of a notion of the rules of health  well he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken his prescriptions with really laughable humility more like charity schoolchildren than bloodguilty mutineers and pirates well thats done for today and now i should wish to have a talk with that boy please  and he nodded his head in my direction carelessly  george merry was at the door spitting and spluttering over some badtasted medicine but at the first word of the doctors proposal he swung round with a deep flush and cried no and swore  silver struck the barrel with his open hand  silence he roared and looked about him positively like a lion doctor he went on in his usual tones i was athinking of that knowing as how you had a fancy for the boy were all humbly grateful for your kindness and as you see puts faith in you and takes the drugs down like that much grog and i take it ive found a way asll suit all hawkins will you give me your word of honour as a young gentleman for a young gentleman you are although poor born your word of honour not to slip your cable  i readily gave the pledge required  then doctor said silver you just step outside o that stockade and once youre there ill bring the boy down on the inside and i reckon you can yarn through the spars good day to you sir and all our dooties to the squire and capn smollett  the explosion of disapproval which nothing but silvers black looks had restrained broke out immediately the doctor had left the house silver was roundly accused of playing double of trying to make a separate peace for himself of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and victims and in one word of the identical exact thing that he was doing it seemed to me so obvious in this case that i could not imagine how he was to turn their anger but he was twice the man the rest were and his last nights victory had given him a huge preponderance on their minds he called them all the fools and dolts you can imagine said it was necessary i should talk to the doctor fluttered the chart in their faces asked them if they could afford to break the treaty the very day they were bound atreasurehunting  no by thunder he cried its us must break the treaty when the time comes and till then ill gammon that doctor if i have to ile his boots with brandy  and then he bade them get the fire lit and stalked out upon his crutch with his hand on my shoulder leaving them in a disarray and silenced by his volubility rather than convinced  slow lad slow he said they might round upon us in a twinkle of an eye if we was seen to hurry  very deliberately then did we advance across the sand to where the doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade and as soon as we were within easy speaking distance silver stopped  youll make a note of this here also doctor says he and the boyll tell you how i saved his life and were deposed for it too and you may lay to that doctor when a mans steering as near the wind as me playing chuckfarthing with the last breath in his body like you wouldnt think it too much mayhap to give him one good word youll please bear in mind its not my life only now its that boys into the bargain and youll speak me fair doctor and give me a bit o hope to go on for the sake of mercy  silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his friends and the block house his cheeks seemed to have fallen in his voice trembled never was a soul more dead in earnest  why john youre not afraid asked dr livesey  doctor im no coward no not i not so much and he snapped his fingers if i was i wouldnt say it but ill own up fairly ive the shakes upon me for the gallows youre a good man and a true i never seen a better man and youll not forget what i done good not any more than youll forget the bad i know and i step aside see here and leave you and jim alone and youll put that down for me too for its a long stretch is that  so saying he stepped back a little way till he was out of earshot and there sat down upon a treestump and began to whistle spinning round now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight sometimes of me and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in the sand between the fire which they were busy rekindling and the house from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the breakfast  so jim said the doctor sadly here you are as you have brewed so shall you drink my boy heaven knows i cannot find it in my heart to blame you but this much i will say be it kind or unkind  when captain smollett was well you dared not have gone off and when he was ill and couldnt help it by george it was downright cowardly  i will own that i here began to weep doctor i said you might spare me i have blamed myself enough my lifes forfeit anyway and i should have been dead by now if silver hadnt stood for me and doctor believe this i can die and i dare say i deserve it but what i fear is torture if they come to torture me   jim the doctor interrupted and his voice was quite changed jim i cant have this whip over and well run for it  doctor said i i passed my word  i know i know he cried we cant help that jim now ill take it on my shoulders holus bolus blame and shame my boy but stay here i cannot let you jump one jump and youre out and well run for it like antelopes  no i replied you know right well you wouldnt do the thing yourself neither you nor squire nor captain and no more will i silver trusted me i passed my word and back i go but doctor you did not let me finish if they come to torture me i might let slip a word of where the ship is for i got the ship part by luck and part by risking and she lies in north inlet on the southern beach and just below high water at half tide she must be high and dry  the ship exclaimed the doctor  rapidly i described to him my adventures and he heard me out in silence  there is a kind of fate in this he observed when i had done every step its you that saves our lives and do you suppose by any chance that we are going to let you lose yours that would be a poor return my boy you found out the plot you found ben gunn the best deed that ever you did or will do though you live to ninety oh by jupiter and talking of ben gunn why this is the mischief in person silver he cried silver ill give you a piece of advice he continued as the cook drew near again dont you be in any great hurry after that treasure  why sir i do my possible which that aint said silver i can only asking your pardon save my life and the boys by seeking for that treasure and you may lay to that  well silver replied the doctor if that is so ill go one step further  look out for squalls when you find it  sir said silver as between man and man thats too much and too little what youre after why you left the block house why you given me that there chart i dont know now do i and yet i done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope but no this heres too much if you wont tell me what you mean plain out just say so and ill leave the helm  no said the doctor musingly ive no right to say more its not my secret you see silver or i give you my word id tell it you but ill go as far with you as i dare go and a step beyond for ill have my wig sorted by the captain or im mistaken and first ill give you a bit of hope silver if we both get alive out of this wolftrap ill do my best to save you short of perjury  silvers face was radiant you couldnt say more im sure sir not if you was my mother he cried  well thats my first concession added the doctor my second is a piece of advice  keep the boy close beside you and when you need help halloo im off to seek it for you and that itself will show you if i speak at random goodbye jim  and dr livesey shook hands with me through the stockade nodded to silver and set off at a brisk pace into the wood     xxxi the treasurehunt flints pointer   jim said silver when we were alone if i saved your life you saved mine and ill not forget it i seen the doctor waving you to run for it with the tail of my eye i did and i seen you say no as plain as hearing jim thats one to you this is the first glint of hope i had since the attack failed and i owe it you and now jim were to go in for this here treasurehunting with sealed orders too and i dont like it and you and me must stick close back to back like and well save our necks in spite o fate and fortune  just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk they had lit a fire fit to roast an ox and it was now grown so hot that they could only approach it from the windward and even there not without precaution in the same wasteful spirit they had cooked i suppose three times more than we could eat and one of them with an empty laugh threw what was left into the fire which blazed and roared again over this unusual fuel i never in my life saw men so careless of the morrow hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way of doing and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries though they were bold enough for a brush and be done with it i could see their entire unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign  even silver eating away with captain flint upon his shoulder had not a word of blame for their recklessness and this the more surprised me for i thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then  aye mates said he its lucky you have barbecue to think for you with this here head i got what i wanted i did sure enough they have the ship where they have it i dont know yet but once we hit the treasure well have to jump about and find out and then mates us that has the boats i reckon has the upper hand  thus he kept running on with his mouth full of the hot bacon thus he restored their hope and confidence and i more than suspect repaired his own at the same time  as for hostage he continued thats his last talk i guess with them he loves so dear ive got my piece o news and thanky to him for that but its over and done ill take him in a line when we go treasurehunting for well keep him like so much gold in case of accidents you mark and in the meantime once we got the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions why then well talk mr hawkins over we will and well give him his share to be sure for all his kindness  it was no wonder the men were in a good humour now for my part i was horribly cast down should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible silver already doubly a traitor would not hesitate to adopt it he had still a foot in either camp and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging which was the best he had to hope on our side  nay and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with dr livesey even then what danger lay before us what a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty and he and i should have to fight for dear life he a cripple and i a boy against five strong and active seamen  add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the behaviour of my friends their unexplained desertion of the stockade their inexplicable cession of the chart or harder still to understand the doctors last warning to silver look out for squalls when you find it and you will readily believe how little taste i found in my breakfast and with how uneasy a heart i set forth behind my captors on the quest for treasure  we made a curious figure had anyone been there to see us all in soiled sailor clothes and all but me armed to the teeth silver had two guns slung about him one before and one behind besides the great cutlass at his waist and a pistol in each pocket of his squaretailed coat to complete his strange appearance captain flint sat perched upon his shoulder and gabbling odds and ends of purposeless seatalk i had a line about my waist and followed obediently after the seacook who held the loose end of the rope now in his free hand now between his powerful teeth for all the world i was led like a dancing bear  the other men were variously burthened some carrying picks and shovels for that had been the very first necessary they brought ashore from the hispaniola others laden with pork bread and brandy for the midday meal all the stores i observed came from our stock and i could see the truth of silvers words the night before had he not struck a bargain with the doctor he and his mutineers deserted by the ship must have been driven to subsist on clear water and the proceeds of their hunting water would have been little to their taste a sailor is not usually a good shot and besides all that when they were so short of eatables it was not likely they would be very flush of powder  well thus equipped we all set out even the fellow with the broken head who should certainly have kept in shadow and straggled one after another to the beach where the two gigs awaited us even these bore trace of the drunken folly of the pirates one in a broken thwart and both in their muddy and unbailed condition both were to be carried along with us for the sake of safety and so with our numbers divided between them we set forth upon the bosom of the anchorage  as we pulled over there was some discussion on the chart the red cross was of course far too large to be a guide and the terms of the note on the back as you will hear admitted of some ambiguity they ran the reader may remember thus        tall tree spyglass shoulder bearing a point to      the n of nne      skeleton island ese and by e      ten feet  a tall tree was thus the principal mark now right before us the anchorage was bounded by a plateau from two to three hundred feet high adjoining on the north the sloping southern shoulder of the spyglass and rising again towards the south into the rough cliffy eminence called the mizzenmast hill the top of the plateau was dotted thickly with pinetrees of varying height every here and there one of a different species rose forty or fifty feet clear above its neighbours and which of these was the particular tall tree of captain flint could only be decided on the spot and by the readings of the compass  yet although that was the case every man on board the boats had picked a favourite of his own ere we were halfway over long john alone shrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they were there  we pulled easily by silvers directions not to weary the hands prematurely and after quite a long passage landed at the mouth of the second river that which runs down a woody cleft of the spyglass thence bending to our left we began to ascend the slope towards the plateau  at the first outset heavy miry ground and a matted marish vegetation greatly delayed our progress but by little and little the hill began to steepen and become stony under foot and the wood to change its character and to grow in a more open order it was indeed a most pleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching a heavyscented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost taken the place of grass thickets of green nutmegtrees were dotted here and there with the red columns and the broad shadow of the pines and the first mingled their spice with the aroma of the others the air besides was fresh and stirring and this under the sheer sunbeams was a wonderful refreshment to our senses  the party spread itself abroad in a fan shape shouting and leaping to and fro about the centre and a good way behind the rest silver and i followed i tethered by my rope he ploughing with deep pants among the sliding gravel from time to time indeed i had to lend him a hand or he must have missed his footing and fallen backward down the hill  we had thus proceeded for about half a mile and were approaching the brow of the plateau when the man upon the farthest left began to cry aloud as if in terror shout after shout came from him and the others began to run in his direction  he cant a found the treasure said old morgan hurrying past us from the right for thats clean atop  indeed as we found when we also reached the spot it was something very different at the foot of a pretty big pine and involved in a green creeper which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones a human skeleton lay with a few shreds of clothing on the ground i believe a chill struck for a moment to every heart  he was a seaman said george merry who bolder than the rest had gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing leastways this is good seacloth  aye aye said silver like enough you wouldnt look to find a bishop here i reckon but what sort of a way is that for bones to lie taint in natur  indeed on a second glance it seemed impossible to fancy that the body was in a natural position but for some disarray the work perhaps of the birds that had fed upon him or of the slowgrowing creeper that had gradually enveloped his remains the man lay perfectly straight his feet pointing in one direction his hands raised above his head like a divers pointing directly in the opposite  ive taken a notion into my old numbskull observed silver heres the compass theres the tiptop pint o skeleton island stickin out like a tooth just take a bearing will you along the line of them bones  it was done the body pointed straight in the direction of the island and the compass read duly ese and by e  i thought so cried the cook this here is a pinter right up there is our line for the pole star and the jolly dollars but by thunder if it dont make me cold inside to think of flint this is one of his jokes and no mistake him and these six was alone here he killed em every man and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass shiver my timbers theyre long bones and the hairs been yellow aye that would be allardyce you mind allardyce tom morgan  aye aye returned morgan i mind him he owed me money he did and took my knife ashore with him  speaking of knives said another why dont we find hisn lying round flint warnt the man to pick a seamans pocket and the birds i guess would leave it be  by the powers and thats true cried silver  there aint a thing left here said merry still feeling round among the bones not a copper doit nor a baccy box it dont look natral to me  no by gum it dont agreed silver not natral nor not nice says you great guns messmates but if flint was living this would be a hot spot for you and me six they were and six are we and bones is what they are now  i saw him dead with these here deadlights said morgan billy took me in there he laid with pennypieces on his eyes  dead aye sure enough hes dead and gone below said the fellow with the bandage but if ever sperrit walked it would be flints dear heart but he died bad did flint  aye that he did observed another now he raged and now he hollered for the rum and now he sang fifteen men were his only song mates and i tell you true i never rightly liked to hear it since it was main hot and the windy was open and i hear that old song comin out as clear as clear and the deathhaul on the man already  come come said silver stow this talk hes dead and he dont walk that i know leastways he wont walk by day and you may lay to that care killed a cat fetch ahead for the doubloons  we started certainly but in spite of the hot sun and the staring daylight the pirates no longer ran separate and shouting through the wood but kept side by side and spoke with bated breath the terror of the dead buccaneer had fallen on their spirits     xxxii the treasurehunt the voice among the trees   partly from the damping influence of this alarm partly to rest silver and the sick folk the whole party sat down as soon as they had gained the brow of the ascent  the plateau being somewhat tilted towards the west this spot on which we had paused commanded a wide prospect on either hand before us over the treetops we beheld the cape of the woods fringed with surf behind we not only looked down upon the anchorage and skeleton island but saw clear across the spit and the eastern lowlands a great field of open sea upon the east sheer above us rose the spyglass here dotted with single pines there black with precipices there was no sound but that of the distant breakers mounting from all round and the chirp of countless insects in the brush not a man not a sail upon the sea the very largeness of the view increased the sense of solitude  silver as he sat took certain bearings with his compass  there are three tall trees said he about in the right line from skeleton island spyglass shoulder i take it means that lower pint there its childs play to find the stuff now ive half a mind to dine first  i dont feel sharp growled morgan thinkin o flint i think it were as done me  ah well my son you praise your stars hes dead said silver  he were an ugly devil cried a third pirate with a shudder that blue in the face too  that was how the rum took him added merry blue well i reckon he was blue thats a true word  ever since they had found the skeleton and got upon this train of thought they had spoken lower and lower and they had almost got to whispering by now so that the sound of their talk hardly interrupted the silence of the wood all of a sudden out of the middle of the trees in front of us a thin high trembling voice struck up the wellknown air and words        fifteen men on the dead mans chest       yohoho and a bottle of rum  i never have seen men more dreadfully affected than the pirates the colour went from their six faces like enchantment some leaped to their feet some clawed hold of others morgan grovelled on the ground  its flint by    cried merry  the song had stopped as suddenly as it began broken off you would have said in the middle of a note as though someone had laid his hand upon the singers mouth coming through the clear sunny atmosphere among the green treetops i thought it had sounded airily and sweetly and the effect on my companions was the stranger  come said silver struggling with his ashen lips to get the word out this wont do stand by to go about this is a rum start and i cant name the voice but its someone skylarking someone thats flesh and blood and you may lay to that  his courage had come back as he spoke and some of the colour to his face along with it already the others had begun to lend an ear to this encouragement and were coming a little to themselves when the same voice broke out again not this time singing but in a faint distant hail that echoed yet fainter among the clefts of the spyglass  darby mgraw it wailed for that is the word that best describes the sound darby mgraw darby mgraw again and again and again and then rising a little higher and with an oath that i leave out  fetch aft the rum darby  the buccaneers remained rooted to the ground their eyes starting from their heads long after the voice had died away they still stared in silence dreadfully before them  that fixes it gasped one lets go  they was his last words moaned morgan his last words above board  dick had his bible out and was praying volubly he had been well brought up had dick before he came to sea and fell among bad companions  still silver was unconquered i could hear his teeth rattle in his head but he had not yet surrendered  nobody in this here island ever heard of darby he muttered not one but us thats here and then making a great effort  shipmates  he cried im here to get that stuff and ill not be beat by man or devil i never was feared of flint in his life and by the powers ill face him dead theres seven hundred thousand pound not a quarter of a mile from here when did ever a gentleman o fortune show his stern to that much dollars for a boozy old seaman with a blue mug and him dead too  but there was no sign of reawakening courage in his followers rather indeed of growing terror at the irreverence of his words  belay there john said merry dont you cross a sperrit  and the rest were all too terrified to reply they would have run away severally had they dared but fear kept them together and kept them close by john as if his daring helped them he on his part had pretty well fought his weakness down  sperrit well maybe he said but theres one thing not clear to me there was an echo now no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow well then whats he doing with an echo to him i should like to know that aint in natur surely  this argument seemed weak enough to me but you can never tell what will affect the superstitious and to my wonder george merry was greatly relieved  well thats so he said youve a head upon your shoulders john and no mistake bout ship mates this here crew is on a wrong tack i do believe and come to think on it it was like flints voice i grant you but not just so clearaway like it after all it was liker somebody elses voice now it was liker   by the powers ben gunn roared silver  aye and so it were cried morgan springing on his knees ben gunn it were  it dont make much odds do it now asked dick ben gunns not here in the body any moren flint  but the older hands greeted this remark with scorn  why nobody minds ben gunn cried merry dead or alive nobody minds him  it was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural colour had revived in their faces soon they were chatting together with intervals of listening and not long after hearing no further sound they shouldered the tools and set forth again merry walking first with silvers compass to keep them on the right line with skeleton island he had said the truth  dead or alive nobody minded ben gunn  dick alone still held his bible and looked around him as he went with fearful glances but he found no sympathy and silver even joked him on his precautions  i told you said he i told you you had spiled your bible if it aint no good to swear by what do you suppose a sperrit would give for it not that and he snapped his big fingers halting a moment on his crutch  but dick was not to be comforted indeed it was soon plain to me that the lad was falling sick hastened by heat exhaustion and the shock of his alarm the fever predicted by dr livesey was evidently growing swiftly higher  it was fine open walking here upon the summit our way lay a little downhill for as i have said the plateau tilted towards the west the pines great and small grew wide apart and even between the clumps of nutmeg and azalea wide open spaces baked in the hot sunshine striking as we did pretty near northwest across the island we drew on the one hand ever nearer under the shoulders of the spyglass and on the other looked ever wider over that western bay where i had once tossed and trembled in the coracle  the first of the tall trees was reached and by the bearings proved the wrong one so with the second the third rose nearly two hundred feet into the air above a clump of underwood a giant of a vegetable with a red column as big as a cottage and a wide shadow around in which a company could have manoeuvred it was conspicuous far to sea both on the east and west and might have been entered as a sailing mark upon the chart  but it was not its size that now impressed my companions it was the knowledge that seven hundred thousand pounds in gold lay somewhere buried below its spreading shadow the thought of the money as they drew nearer swallowed up their previous terrors their eyes burned in their heads their feet grew speedier and lighter their whole soul was bound up in that fortune that whole lifetime of extravagance and pleasure that lay waiting there for each of them  silver hobbled grunting on his crutch his nostrils stood out and quivered he cursed like a madman when the flies settled on his hot and shiny countenance he plucked furiously at the line that held me to him and from time to time turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look certainly he took no pains to hide his thoughts and certainly i read them like print in the immediate nearness of the gold all else had been forgotten  his promise and the doctors warning were both things of the past and i could not doubt that he hoped to seize upon the treasure find and board the hispaniola under cover of night cut every honest throat about that island and sail away as he had at first intended laden with crimes and riches  shaken as i was with these alarms it was hard for me to keep up with the rapid pace of the treasurehunters now and again i stumbled and it was then that silver plucked so roughly at the rope and launched at me his murderous glances dick who had dropped behind us and now brought up the rear was babbling to himself both prayers and curses as his fever kept rising this also added to my wretchedness and to crown all i was haunted by the thought of the tragedy that had once been acted on that plateau when that ungodly buccaneer with the blue face he who died at savannah singing and shouting for drink had there with his own hand cut down his six accomplices this grove that was now so peaceful must then have rung with cries i thought and even with the thought i could believe i heard it ringing still  we were now at the margin of the thicket  huzza mates all together shouted merry and the foremost broke into a run  and suddenly not ten yards further we beheld them stop a low cry arose silver doubled his pace digging away with the foot of his crutch like one possessed and next moment he and i had come also to a dead halt  before us was a great excavation not very recent for the sides had fallen in and grass had sprouted on the bottom in this were the shaft of a pick broken in two and the boards of several packingcases strewn around on one of these boards i saw branded with a hot iron the name walrus the name of flints ship  all was clear to probation the cache had been found and rifled the seven hundred thousand pounds were gone     xxxiii the fall of a chieftain   there never was such an overturn in this world each of these six men was as though he had been struck but with silver the blow passed almost instantly every thought of his soul had been set fullstretch like a racer on that money well he was brought up in a single second dead and he kept his head found his temper and changed his plan before the others had had time to realize the disappointment  jim he whispered take that and stand by for trouble  and he passed me a doublebarrelled pistol  at the same time he began quietly moving northward and in a few steps had put the hollow between us two and the other five then he looked at me and nodded as much as to say here is a narrow corner as indeed i thought it was his looks were not quite friendly and i was so revolted at these constant changes that i could not forbear whispering so youve changed sides again  there was no time left for him to answer in the buccaneers with oaths and cries began to leap one after another into the pit and to dig with their fingers throwing the boards aside as they did so morgan found a piece of gold he held it up with a perfect spout of oaths it was a twoguinea piece and it went from hand to hand among them for a quarter of a minute  two guineas roared merry shaking it at silver thats your seven hundred thousand pounds is it youre the man for bargains aint you youre him that never bungled nothing you woodenheaded lubber  dig away boys said silver with the coolest insolence youll find some pignuts and i shouldnt wonder  pignuts repeated merry in a scream mates do you hear that i tell you now that man there knew it all along look in the face of him and youll see it wrote there  ah merry remarked silver standing for capn again youre a pushing lad to be sure  but this time everyone was entirely in merrys favour they began to scramble out of the excavation darting furious glances behind them one thing i observed which looked well for us  they all got out upon the opposite side from silver  well there we stood two on one side five on the other the pit between us and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow silver never moved he watched them very upright on his crutch and looked as cool as ever i saw him he was brave and no mistake  at last merry seemed to think a speech might help matters  mates says he theres two of them alone there ones the old cripple that brought us all here and blundered us down to this the others that cub that i mean to have the heart of now mates   he was raising his arm and his voice and plainly meant to lead a charge but just then crack crack crack three musketshots flashed out of the thicket merry tumbled head foremost into the excavation the man with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and fell all his length upon his side where he lay dead but still twitching and the other three turned and ran for it with all their might  before you could wink long john had fired two barrels of a pistol into the struggling merry and as the man rolled up his eyes at him in the last agony george said he i reckon i settled you  at the same moment the doctor gray and ben gunn joined us with smoking muskets from among the nutmegtrees  forward cried the doctor double quick my lads we must head em off the boats  and we set off at a great pace sometimes plunging through the bushes to the chest  i tell you but silver was anxious to keep up with us the work that man went through leaping on his crutch till the muscles of his chest were fit to burst was work no sound man ever equalled and so thinks the doctor as it was he was already thirty yards behind us and on the verge of strangling when we reached the brow of the slope  doctor he hailed see there no hurry  sure enough there was no hurry in a more open part of the plateau we could see the three survivors still running in the same direction as they had started right for mizzenmast hill we were already between them and the boats and so we four sat down to breathe while long john mopping his face came slowly up with us  thank ye kindly doctor says he you came in in about the nick i guess for me and hawkins and so its you ben gunn he added well youre a nice one to be sure  im ben gunn i am replied the maroon wriggling like an eel in his embarrassment and he added after a long pause how do mr silver pretty well i thank ye says you  ben ben murmured silver to think as youve done me  the doctor sent back gray for one of the pickaxes deserted in their flight by the mutineers and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to where the boats were lying related in a few words what had taken place it was a story that profoundly interested silver and ben gunn the halfidiot maroon was the hero from beginning to end  ben in his long lonely wanderings about the island had found the skeleton it was he that had rifled it he had found the treasure he had dug it up it was the haft of his pickaxe that lay broken in the excavation he had carried it on his back in many weary journeys from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the twopointed hill at the northeast angle of the island and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the hispaniola  when the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted he had gone to silver given him the chart which was now useless given him the stores for ben gunns cave was well supplied with goats meat salted by himself given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the twopointed hill there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money  as for you jim he said it went against my heart but i did what i thought best for those who had stood by their duty and if you were not one of these whose fault was it  that morning finding that i was to be involved in the horrid disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers he had run all the way to the cave and leaving the squire to guard the captain had taken gray and the maroon and started making the diagonal across the island to be at hand beside the pine soon however he saw that our party had the start of him and ben gunn being fleet of foot had been dispatched in front to do his best alone then it had occurred to him to work upon the superstitions of his former shipmates and he was so far successful that gray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the arrival of the treasurehunters  ah said silver it were fortunate for me that i had hawkins here you would have let old john be cut to bits and never given it a thought doctor  not a thought replied dr livesey cheerily  and by this time we had reached the gigs the doctor with the pickaxe demolished one of them and then we all got aboard the other and set out to go round by sea for north inlet  this was a run of eight or nine miles silver though he was almost killed already with fatigue was set to an oar like the rest of us and we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea soon we passed out of the straits and doubled the southeast corner of the island round which four days ago we had towed the hispaniola  as we passed the twopointed hill we could see the black mouth of ben gunns cave and a figure standing by it leaning on a musket it was the squire and we waved a handkerchief and gave him three cheers in which the voice of silver joined as heartily as any  three miles farther just inside the mouth of north inlet what should we meet but the hispaniola cruising by herself the last flood had lifted her and had there been much wind or a strong tide current as in the southern anchorage we should never have found her more or found her stranded beyond help as it was there was little amiss beyond the wreck of the mainsail another anchor was got ready and dropped in a fathom and a half of water we all pulled round again to rum cove the nearest point for ben gunns treasurehouse and then gray singlehanded returned with the gig to the hispaniola where he was to pass the night on guard  a gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave at the top the squire met us to me he was cordial and kind saying nothing of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise at silvers polite salute he somewhat flushed  john silver he said youre a prodigious villain and imposter a monstrous imposter sir i am told i am not to prosecute you well then i will not but the dead men sir hang about your neck like millstones  thank you kindly sir replied long john again saluting  i dare you to thank me cried the squire it is a gross dereliction of my duty stand back  and thereupon we all entered the cave it was a large airy place with a little spring and a pool of clear water overhung with ferns the floor was sand before a big fire lay captain smollett and in a far corner only duskily flickered over by the blaze i beheld great heaps of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold that was flints treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the hispaniola how many it had cost in the amassing what blood and sorrow what good ships scuttled on the deep what brave men walking the plank blindfold what shot of cannon what shame and lies and cruelty perhaps no man alive could tell yet there were still three upon that island silver and old morgan and ben gunn who had each taken his share in these crimes as each had hoped in vain to share in the reward  come in jim said the captain youre a good boy in your line jim but i dont think you and mell go to sea again youre too much of the born favourite for me is that you john silver what brings you here man  come back to my dooty sir returned silver  ah said the captain and that was all he said  what a supper i had of it that night with all my friends around me and what a meal it was with ben gunns salted goat and some delicacies and a bottle of old wine from the hispaniola never i am sure were people gayer or happier and there was silver sitting back almost out of the firelight but eating heartily prompt to spring forward when anything was wanted even joining quietly in our laughter the same bland polite obsequious seaman of the voyage out     xxxiv and last   the next morning we fell early to work for the transportation of this great mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach and thence three miles by boat to the hispaniola was a considerable task for so small a number of workmen the three fellows still abroad upon the island did not greatly trouble us a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was sufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught and we thought besides they had had more than enough of fighting  therefore the work was pushed on briskly gray and ben gunn came and went with the boat while the rest during their absences piled treasure on the beach two of the bars slung in a ropes end made a good load for a grown man one that he was glad to walk slowly with for my part as i was not much use at carrying i was kept busy all day in the cave packing the minted money into breadbags  it was a strange collection like billy boness hoard for the diversity of coinage but so much larger and so much more varied that i think i never had more pleasure than in sorting them english french spanish portuguese georges and louises doubloons and double guineas and moidores and sequins the pictures of all the kings of europe for the last hundred years strange oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spiders web round pieces and square pieces and pieces bored through the middle as if to wear them round your neck nearly every variety of money in the world must i think have found a place in that collection and for number i am sure they were like autumn leaves so that my back ached with stooping and my fingers with sorting them out  day after day this work went on by every evening a fortune had been stowed aboard but there was another fortune waiting for the morrow and all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers  at last i think it was on the third night the doctor and i were strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of the isle when from out the thick darkness below the wind brought us a noise between shrieking and singing it was only a snatch that reached our ears followed by the former silence  heaven forgive them said the doctor tis the mutineers  all drunk sir struck in the voice of silver from behind us  silver i should say was allowed his entire liberty and in spite of daily rebuffs seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged and friendly dependent indeed it was remarkable how well he bore these slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to ingratiate himself with all yet i think none treated him better than a dog unless it was ben gunn who was still terribly afraid of his old quartermaster or myself who had really something to thank him for although for that matter i suppose i had reason to think even worse of him than anybody else for i had seen him meditating a fresh treachery upon the plateau accordingly it was pretty gruffly that the doctor answered him  drunk or raving said he  right you were sir replied silver and precious little odds which to you and me  i suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man returned the doctor with a sneer and so my feelings may surprise you master silver but if i were sure they were raving as i am morally certain one at least of them is down with fever i should leave this camp and at whatever risk to my own carcass take them the assistance of my skill  ask your pardon sir you would be very wrong quoth silver you would lose your precious life and you may lay to that im on your side now hand and glove and i shouldnt wish for to see the party weakened let alone yourself seeing as i know what i owes you but these men down there they couldnt keep their word no not supposing they wished to and whats more they couldnt believe as you could  no said the doctor youre the man to keep your word we know that  well that was about the last news we had of the three pirates only once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting a council was held and it was decided that we must desert them on the island to the huge glee i must say of ben gunn and with the strong approval of gray we left a good stock of powder and shot the bulk of the salt goat a few medicines and some other necessaries tools clothing a spare sail a fathom or two of rope and by the particular desire of the doctor a handsome present of tobacco  that was about our last doing on the island before that we had got the treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the goat meat in case of any distress and at last one fine morning we weighed anchor which was about all that we could manage and stood out of north inlet the same colours flying that the captain had flown and fought under at the palisade  the three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for as we soon had proved for coming through the narrows we had to lie very near the southern point and there we saw all three of them kneeling together on a spit of sand with their arms raised in supplication it went to all our hearts i think to leave them in that wretched state but we could not risk another mutiny and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness the doctor hailed them and told them of the stores we had left and where they were to find them but they continued to call us by name and appeal to us for gods sake to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a place  at last seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly drawing out of earshot one of them i know not which it was leapt to his feet with a hoarse cry whipped his musket to his shoulder and sent a shot whistling over silvers head and through the mainsail  after that we kept under cover of the bulwarks and when next i looked out they had disappeared from the spit and the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance that was at least the end of that and before noon to my inexpressible joy the highest rock of treasure island had sunk into the blue round of sea  we were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a hand only the captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders for though greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet we laid her head for the nearest port in spanish america for we could not risk the voyage home without fresh hands and as it was what with baffling winds and a couple of fresh gales we were all worn out before we reached it  it was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful landlocked gulf and were immediately surrounded by shore boats full of negroes and mexican indians and halfbloods selling fruits and vegetables and offering to dive for bits of money the sight of so many goodhumoured faces especially the blacks the taste of the tropical fruits and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island and the doctor and the squire taking me along with them went ashore to pass the early part of the night here they met the captain of an english manofwar fell in talk with him went on board his ship and in short had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came alongside the hispaniola  ben gunn was on deck alone and as soon as we came on board he began with wonderful contortions to make us a confession silver was gone the maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago and he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives which would certainly have been forfeit if that man with the one leg had stayed aboard but this was not all the seacook had not gone emptyhanded he had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed one of the sacks of coin worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas to help him on his further wanderings  i think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him  well to make a long story short we got a few hands on board made a good cruise home and the hispaniola reached bristol just as mr blandly was beginning to think of fitting out her consort five men only of those who had sailed returned with her drink and the devil had done for the rest with a vengeance although to be sure we were not quite in so bad a case as that other ship they sang about        with one man of her crew alive      what put to sea with seventyfive  all of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or foolishly according to our natures captain smollett is now retired from the sea gray not only saved his money but being suddenly smit with the desire to rise also studied his profession and he is now mate and part owner of a fine fullrigged ship married besides and the father of a family as for ben gunn he got a thousand pounds which he spent or lost in three weeks or to be more exact in nineteen days for he was back begging on the twentieth then he was given a lodge to keep exactly as he had feared upon the island and he still lives a great favourite though something of a butt with the country boys and a notable singer in church on sundays and saints days  of silver we have heard no more that formidable seafaring man with one leg has at last gone clean out of my life but i dare say he met his old negress and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and captain flint it is to be hoped so i suppose for his chances of comfort in another world are very small  the bar silver and the arms still lie for all that i know where flint buried them and certainly they shall lie there for me oxen and wainropes would not bring me back again to that accursed island and the worst dreams that ever i have are when i hear the surf booming about its coasts or start upright in bed with the sharp voice of captain flint still ringing in my ears  pieces of eight pieces of eight,treasure island,robert louis stevenson
